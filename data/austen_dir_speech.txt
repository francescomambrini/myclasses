1A	"How uncomfortable it is,"	102: 22,20A  !
1A	"not	102: 22,20A  !
1A	to have a single acquaintance here|"	102: 22,21A  !
1A	"What shall we do? ~ The gentlemen and ladies at	102: 22,22A  !
1A	this table look as if they wondered why we came here~	102: 22,23A  !
1A	we seem forcing ourselves into their party."	102: 22,24A  !
1A	"I wish we had \any\;~ it would be somebody to go to."	102: 22,27A  !
1A	"Had not we better go away as it is?~ Here are no	102: 22,31A  !
1A	tea things for us, you see."	102: 22,32A  !
1A	"No, indeed, it looks very nice.~ But, dear Mrs% Allen,	102: 23, 1A  !
1A	are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude	102: 23, 2A  !
1A	of people? I think you \must\ know somebody."	102: 23, 3A  !
1A	"Very agreeable indeed,"	102: 23,17A  !
1B	"I have hitherto been very	103: 25,25B  !
1B	remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner	103: 25,26B  !
1B	here; I have not yet asked you how long you have been	103: 25,27B  !
1B	in Bath; whether you were ever here before; whether	103: 25,28B  !
1B	you have been at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, and the	103: 25,29B  !
1B	concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have	103: 25,30B  !
1B	been very negligent ~ but are you now at leisure to satisfy	103: 25,31B  !
1B	me in these particulars? If you are I will begin directly."	103: 25,32B  !
1A	"You need not give yourself that trouble, sir."	103: 25,33A  !
1B	"No trouble I assure you, madam."	103: 26, 1B  !
1B	"Have you been	103: 26, 3B  !
1B	long in Bath, madam?"	103: 26, 4B  !
1A	"About a week, sir,"	103: 26, 5A  !
1B	"Really|"	103: 26, 7B  !
1A	"Why should you be surprized, sir?"	103: 26, 8A  !
1B	"Why, indeed|"	103: 26, 9B  !
1B	"but	103: 26, 9B  !
1B	some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply,	103: 26,10B  !
1B	and surprize is more easily assumed, and not less reasonable	103: 26,11B  !
1B	than any other.~ Now let us go on. Were you never	103: 26,12B  !
1B	here before, madam?"	103: 26,13B  !
1A	"Never, sir."	103: 26,14A  !
1B	"Indeed| Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?"	103: 26,15B  !
1A	"Yes, sir, I was there last Monday."	103: 26,16A  !
1B	"Have you been to the theatre?"	103: 26,17B  !
1A	"Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday."	103: 26,18A  !
1B	"To the concert?"	103: 26,19B  !
1A	"Yes, sir, on Wednesday."	103: 26,20A  !
1B	"And are you altogether pleased with Bath?"	103: 26,21B  !
1A	"Yes ~ I like it very well."	103: 26,22A  !
1B	"Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be	103: 26,23B  !
1B	rational again."	103: 26,24B  !
1B	"I see what you think of me,"	103: 26,27B  !
1B	"I	103: 26,27B  !
1B	shall make but a poor figure in your journal to-morrow."	103: 26,28B  !
1A	"My journal|"	103: 26,29A  !
1B	"Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday,	103: 26,30B  !
1B	went to the Lower Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin	103: 26,31B  !
1B	robe with blue trimmings ~ plain black shoes ~ appeared	103: 26,32B  !
1B	to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by	103: 26,33B  !
1B	a queer, half-witted man, who would make me dance	103: 26,34B  !
1B	with him, and distressed me by his nonsense."	103: 26,35B  !
1A	"Indeed I shall say no such thing."	103: 26,36A  !
1B	"Shall I tell you what you ought to say?"	103: 26,37B  !
1A	"If you please."	103: 26,38A  !
1B	"I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced	103: 27, 1B  !
1B	by Mr% King; had a great deal of conversation	103: 27, 2B  !
1B	with him ~ seems a most extraordinary genius ~ hope	103: 27, 3B  !
1B	I may know more of him. \That\, madam, is what I \wish\	103: 27, 4B  !
1B	you to say."	103: 27, 5B  !
1A	"But, perhaps, I keep no journal."	103: 27, 6A  !
1B	"Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am	103: 27, 7B  !
1B	not sitting by you. These are points in which a doubt is	103: 27, 8B  !
1B	equally possible. Not keep a journal| How are your	103: 27, 9B  !
1B	absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in	103: 27,10B  !
1B	Bath without one? How are the civilities and compliments	103: 27,11B  !
1B	of every day to be related as they ought to be,	103: 27,12B  !
1B	unless noted down every evening in a journal? How are	103: 27,13B  !
1B	your various dresses to be remembered, and the particular	103: 27,14B  !
1B	state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to be	103: 27,15B  !
1B	described in all their diversities, without having constant	103: 27,16B  !
1B	recourse to a journal? ~ My dear madam, I am not so	103: 27,17B  !
1B	ignorant of young ladies' ways as you wish to believe me;	103: 27,18B  !
1B	it is this delightful habit of journalizing which largely	103: 27,19B  !
1B	contributes to form the easy style of writing for which	103: 27,20B  !
1B	ladies are so generally celebrated. Every body allows	103: 27,21B  !
1B	that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly	103: 27,22B  !
1B	female. Nature may have done something, but I am sure	103: 27,23B  !
1B	it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping	103: 27,24B  !
1B	a journal."	103: 27,25B  !
1A	"I have sometimes thought,"	103: 27,26A  !
1A	"whether ladies do write so much better letters	103: 27,27A  !
1A	than gentlemen| That is ~ I should not think the	103: 27,28A  !
1A	superiority was always on our side."	103: 27,29A  !
1B	"As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears	103: 27,30B  !
1B	to me that the usual style of letter-writing among women	103: 27,31B  !
1B	is faultless, except in three particulars."	103: 27,32B  !
1A	"And what are they?"	103: 27,33A  !
1B	"A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to	103: 27,34B  !
1B	stops, and a very frequent ignorance of grammar."	103: 27,35B  !
1A	"Upon my word| I need not have been afraid of disclaiming	103: 27,36A  !
1A	the compliment. You do not think too highly	103: 27,37A  !
1A	of us in that way."	103: 27,38A  !
1B	"I should no more lay it down as a general rule that	103: 28, 1B  !
1B	women write better letters than men, than that they sing	103: 28, 2B  !
1B	better duets, or draw better landscapes. In every power,	103: 28, 3B  !
1B	of which taste is the foundation, excellence is pretty fairly	103: 28, 4B  !
1B	divided between the sexes."	103: 28, 5B  !
1B	"That is exactly what I should have guessed it,	103: 28,11B  !
1B	madam,"	103: 28,12B  !
1B	"Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats,	103: 28,14B  !
1B	and am allowed to be an excellent judge; and my sister	103: 28,15B  !
1B	has often trusted me in the choice of a gown. I bought	103: 28,16B  !
1B	one for her the other day, and it was pronounced to be	103: 28,17B  !
1B	a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it. I gave	103: 28,18B  !
1B	but five shillings a yard for it, and a true Indian muslin."	103: 28,19B  !
1B	"I hope I am, madam."	103: 28,25B  !
1B	"It is very pretty, madam,"	103: 28,28B  !
1B	"but I do not think it will wash well; I am afraid	103: 28,29B  !
1B	it will fray."	103: 28,30B  !
1A	"How can you,"	103: 28,31A  !
1A	"be so ~~"	103: 28,31A  !
1B	"But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to	103: 28,35B  !
1B	some account or other; Miss Morland will get enough	103: 28,36B  !
1B	out of it for a handkerchief, or a cap, or a cloak.~ Muslin	103: 28,37B  !
1B	can never be said to be wasted. I have heard my sister	103: 28,38B  !
1B	say so forty times, when she has been extravagant in	103: 29, 1B  !
1B	buying more than she wanted, or careless in cutting it to	103: 29, 2B  !
1B	pieces."	103: 29, 3B  !
1B	"What are	103: 29,16B  !
1B	you thinking of so earnestly?"	103: 29,17B  !
1B	"not of your partner, I hope,	103: 29,18B  !
1B	for, by that shake of the head, your meditations are not	103: 29,19B  !
1B	satisfactory."	103: 29,20B  !
1A	"I was not thinking of	103: 29,21A  !
1A	any thing."	103: 29,22A  !
1B	"That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather	103: 29,23B  !
1B	be told at once that you will not tell me."	103: 29,24B  !
1A	"Well then, I will not."	103: 29,25A  !
1B	"Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as	103: 29,26B  !
1B	I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever	103: 29,27B  !
1B	we meet, and nothing in the world advances intimacy so	103: 29,28B  !
1B	much."	103: 29,29B  !
1D	"How excessively like	104: 32,36D  !
1D	her brother Miss Morland is|"	104: 32,37D  !
1D	"for she must	105: 36,13D  !
1D	confess herself very partial to the profession;"	105: 36,14D  !
1D	"My dearest creature, what can have	106: 39, 9D  !
1D	made you so late? I have been waiting for you at least	106: 39,10D  !
1D	this age|"	106: 39,11D  !
1A	"Have you, indeed| ~ I am very sorry for it; but	106: 39,12A  !
1A	really I thought I was in very good time. It is but just	106: 39,13A  !
1A	one. I hope you have not been here long?"	106: 39,14A  !
1D	"Oh| these ten ages at least. I am sure I have been	106: 39,15D  !
1D	here this half hour. But now, let us go and sit down at	106: 39,16D  !
1D	the other end of the room, and enjoy ourselves. I have	106: 39,17D  !
1D	an hundred things to say to you. In the first place, I was	106: 39,18D  !
1D	so afraid it would rain this morning, just as I wanted to	106: 39,19D  !
1D	set off; it looked very showery, and that would have	106: 39,20D  !
1D	thrown me into agonies| Do you know, I saw the prettiest	106: 39,21D  !
1D	hat you can imagine, in a shop window in Milsom-street	106: 39,22D  !
1D	just now ~ very like yours, only with coquelicot ribbons	106: 39,23D  !
1D	instead of green; I quite longed for it. But, my dearest	106: 39,24D  !
1D	Catherine, what have you been doing with yourself all	106: 39,25D  !
1D	this morning?~ Have you gone on with Udolpho?"	106: 39,26D  !
1A	"Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and	106: 39,27A  !
1A	I am got to the black veil."	106: 39,28A  !
1A	"Are you, indeed? How delightful| Oh| I would	106: 39,29A  !
1A	not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world|	106: 39,30A  !
1A	Are not you wild to know?"	106: 39,31A  !
1A	"Oh| yes, quite; what can it be?~ But do not tell	106: 39,32A  !
1A	me ~ I would not be told upon any account. I know it	106: 39,33A  !
1A	must be a skeleton, I am sure it is Laurentina's skeleton.	106: 40, 1A  !
1A	Oh| I am delighted with the book| I should like to	106: 40, 2A  !
1A	spend my whole life in reading it. I assure you, if it had	106: 40, 3A  !
1A	not been to meet you, I would not have come away from	106: 40, 4A  !
1A	it for all the world."	106: 40, 5A  !
1D	"Dear creature| how much I am obliged to you;	106: 40, 6D  !
1D	and when you have finished Udolpho we will read the Italian	106: 40, 7D  !
1D	together; and I have made out a list of ten or	106: 40, 8D  !
1D	twelve more of the same kind for you."	106: 40, 9D  !
1A	"Have you, indeed| How glad I am|~ What are	106: 40,10A  !
1A	they all?"	106: 40,11A  !
1D	"I will read you their names directly; here they are,	106: 40,12D  !
1D	in my pocket-book. Castle of Wolfenbach, Clermont,	106: 40,13D  !
1D	Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the Black Forest,	106: 40,14D  !
1D	Midnight Bell, Orphan of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries.	106: 40,15D  !
1D	Those will last us some time."	106: 40,16D  !
1A	"Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you	106: 40,17A  !
1A	sure they are all horrid?"	106: 40,18A  !
1D	"Yes, quite sure; for a particular friend of mine,	106: 40,19D  !
1D	a Miss Andrews, a sweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures	106: 40,20D  !
1D	in the world, has read every one of them. I wish you	106: 40,21D  !
1D	knew Miss Andrews, you would be delighted with her.	106: 40,22D  !
1D	She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive.	106: 40,23D  !
1D	I think her as beautiful as an angel, and I am so vexed	106: 40,24D  !
1D	with the men for not admiring her|~ I scold them all	106: 40,25D  !
1D	amazingly about it|"	106: 40,26D  !
1A	"Scold them| Do you scold them for not admiring	106: 40,27A  !
1A	her?"	106: 40,28A  !
1D	"Yes, that I do. There is nothing I would not do for	106: 40,29D  !
1D	those who are really my friends. I have no notion of	106: 40,30D  !
1D	loving people by halves, it is not my nature. My attachments	106: 40,31D  !
1D	are always excessively strong. I told Capt% Hunt	106: 40,32D  !
1D	at one of our assemblies this winter, that if he was to	106: 40,33D  !
1D	tease me all night, I would not dance with him, unless	106: 40,34D  !
1D	he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an	106: 40,35D  !
1D	angel. The men think us incapable of real friendship you	106: 40,36D  !
1D	know, and I am determined to shew them the difference.	106: 40,37D  !
1D	Now, if I were to hear any body speak slightingly of you,	106: 40,38D  !
1D	I should fire up in a moment:~ but that is not at all	106: 41, 1D  !
1D	likely, for \you\ are just the kind of girl to be a great	106: 41, 2D  !
1D	favourite with the men."	106: 41, 3D  !
1A	"Oh| dear,"	106: 41, 4A  !
1A	"how can you	106: 41, 4A  !
1A	say so?"	106: 41, 5A  !
1D	"I know you very well; you have so much animation,	106: 41, 6D  !
1D	which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants, for I must	106: 41, 7D  !
1D	confess there is something amazingly insipid about her.	106: 41, 8D  !
1D	Oh| I must tell you, that just after we parted yesterday,	106: 41, 9D  !
1D	I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly ~ I am	106: 41,10D  !
1D	sure he is in love with you."	106: 41,11D  !
1D	"It is very true, upon	106: 41,12D  !
1D	my honour, but I see how it is; you are indifferent to	106: 41,13D  !
1D	every body's admiration, except that of one gentleman,	106: 41,14D  !
1D	who shall be nameless. Nay, I cannot blame you ~	106: 41,15D  !
1D	your feelings are easily understood.	106: 41,16D  !
1D	Where the heart is really attached, I know very	106: 41,17D  !
1D	well how little one can be pleased with the attention of	106: 41,18D  !
1D	any body else. Every thing is so insipid, so uninteresting,	106: 41,19D  !
1D	that does not relate to the beloved object| I can perfectly	106: 41,20D  !
1D	comprehend your feelings."	106: 41,21D  !
1A	"But you should not persuade me that I think so very	106: 41,22A  !
1A	much about Mr% Tilney, for perhaps I may never see him	106: 41,23A  !
1A	again."	106: 41,24A  !
1D	"Not see him again| My dearest creature, do not talk of	106: 41,25D  !
1D	it. I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so."	106: 41,26D  !
1A	"No, indeed, I should not. I do not pretend to say	106: 41,27A  !
1A	that I was not very much pleased with him; but while	106: 41,28A  !
1A	I have Udolpho to read, I feel as if nobody could make	106: 41,29A  !
1A	me miserable. Oh| the dreadful black veil| My dear	106: 41,30A  !
1A	Isabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina's skeleton	106: 41,31A  !
1A	behind it."	106: 41,32A  !
1D	"It is so odd to me, that you should never have read	106: 41,33D  !
1D	Udolpho before; but I suppose Mrs% Morland objects to	106: 41,34D  !
1D	novels."	106: 41,35D  !
1A	"No, she does not. She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison	106: 41,36A  !
1A	herself; but new books do not fall in our way."	106: 41,37A  !
1D	"Sir Charles Grandison| That is an amazing horrid	106: 41,38D  !
1D	book, is it not? ~ I remember Miss Andrews could not get	106: 42, 1D  !
1D	through the first volume."	106: 42, 2D  !
1A	"It is not like Udolpho at all; yet I think it is	106: 42, 3A  !
1A	very entertaining."	106: 42, 4A  !
1D	"Do you indeed| ~ you surprize me; I thought it had	106: 42, 5D  !
1D	not been readable. But, my dearest Catherine, have you	106: 42, 6D  !
1D	settled what to wear on your head to-night? I am determined	106: 42, 7D  !
1D	at all events to be dressed exactly like you. The	106: 42, 8D  !
1D	men take notice of \that\ sometimes you know."	106: 42, 9D  !
1A	"But it does not signify if they do;"	106: 42,10A  !
1D	"Signify| Oh, heavens| I make it a rule never to	106: 42,12D  !
1D	mind what they say. They are very often amazingly	106: 42,13D  !
1D	impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit, and	106: 42,14D  !
1D	make them keep their distance."	106: 42,15D  !
1A	"Are they?~ Well, I never observed \that\. They	106: 42,16A  !
1A	always behave very well to me."	106: 42,17A  !
1D	"Oh| they give themselves such airs. They are the	106: 42,18D  !
1D	most conceited creatures in the world, and think themselves	106: 42,19D  !
1D	of so much importance|~ By the bye, though	106: 42,20D  !
1D	I have thought of it a hundred times, I have always	106: 42,21D  !
1D	forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in	106: 42,22D  !
1D	a man. Do you like them best dark or fair?"	106: 42,23D  !
1A	"I hardly know. I never much thought about it.	106: 42,24A  !
1A	Something between both, I think. Brown ~ not fair, and	106: 42,25A  !
1A	not very dark."	106: 42,26A  !
1D	"Very well, Catherine. That is exactly he. I have not	106: 42,27D  !
1D	forgot your description of Mr% Tilney;~	106: 42,28D  !
1D	"Well, my taste is	106: 42,29D  !
1D	different. I prefer light eyes, and as to complexion ~ do	106: 42,30D  !
1D	you know ~ I like a sallow better than any other. You	106: 42,31D  !
1D	must not betray me, if you should ever meet with one of	106: 42,32D  !
1D	your acquaintance answering that description."	106: 42,33D  !
1A	"Betray you|~ What do you mean?"	106: 42,34A  !
1D	"Nay, do not distress me. I believe I have said too	106: 42,35D  !
1D	much. Let us drop the subject."	106: 42,36D  !
1D	"For Heaven's	106: 43, 3D  !
1D	sake| let us move away from this end of the room. Do	106: 43, 4D  !
1D	you know, there are two odious young men who have	106: 43, 5D  !
1D	been staring at me this half hour. They really put me	106: 43, 6D  !
1D	quite out of countenance. Let us go and look at the	106: 43, 7D  !
1D	arrivals. They will hardly follow us there."	106: 43, 8D  !
1D	"They are not coming this way, are they? I hope they	106: 43,12D  !
1D	are not so impertinent as to follow us. Pray let me know	106: 43,13D  !
1D	if they are coming. I am determined I will not look up."	106: 43,14D  !
1D	"And which way are they gone?"	106: 43,18D  !
1D	"One was a very good-looking young man."	106: 43,19D  !
1A	"They went towards the churchyard."	106: 43,20A  !
1D	"Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them|	106: 43,21D  !
1D	And now, what say you to going to Edgar's Buildings	106: 43,22D  !
1D	with me, and looking at my new hat? You said you	106: 43,23D  !
1D	should like to see it."	106: 43,24D  !
1A	"Only,"	106: 43,25A  !
1A	"perhaps	106: 43,25A  !
1A	we may overtake the two young men."	106: 43,26A  !
1D	"Oh| never mind that. If we make haste, we shall pass	106: 43,27D  !
1D	by them presently, and I am dying to shew you my hat."	106: 43,28D  !
1A	"But if we only wait a few minutes, there will be no	106: 43,29A  !
1A	danger of our seeing them at all."	106: 43,30A  !
1D	"I shall not pay them any such compliment, I assure	106: 43,31D  !
1D	you. I have no notion of treating men with such respect.	106: 43,32D  !
1D	\That\ is the way to spoil them."	106: 43,33D  !
1D	"Oh, these odious gigs|"	107: 44,23D  !
1D	"how I detest them."	107: 44,24D  !
1D	"Delightful| Mr% Morland and my brother|"	107: 44,26D  !
1A	"Good heaven| 'tis James|"	107: 44,27A  !
1E	"How long do you think we have been running	107: 45,23E  !
1E	it from Tetbury, Miss Morland?"	107: 45,24E  !
1A	"I do not know the distance."	107: 45,25A  !
1E	"\Three\-and-twenty|"	107: 45,27E  !
1E	"five-and-twenty	107: 45,27E  !
1E	if it is an inch."	107: 45,28E  !
1E	"I know it must be five-and-twenty,"	107: 45,31E  !
1E	"by the time we have been doing it. It is now half	107: 45,32E  !
1E	after one; we drove out of the inn-yard at Tetbury as	107: 45,33E  !
1E	the town-clock struck eleven; and I defy any man in	107: 45,34E  !
1E	England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour	107: 45,35E  !
1E	in harness; that makes it exactly twenty-five."	107: 45,36E  !
1E	"Ten o'clock| it was eleven, upon my soul| I counted	107: 46, 1E  !
1E	every stroke. This brother of yours would persuade me	107: 46, 2E  !
1E	out of my senses, Miss Morland; do but look at my	107: 46, 3E  !
1E	horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in	107: 46, 4E  !
1E	your life?"	107: 46, 5E  !
1E	"Such true blood| Three hours	107: 46, 6E  !
1E	and a half indeed coming only three-and-twenty miles|	107: 46, 7E  !
1E	look at that creature, and suppose it possible if you can."	107: 46, 8E  !
1A	"He \does\ look very hot to be sure."	107: 46, 9A  !
1E	"Hot| he had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church:	107: 46,10E  !
1E	but look at his forehand; look at his loins;	107: 46,11E  !
1E	only see how he moves; that horse \cannot\ go less than	107: 46,12E  !
1E	ten miles an hour: tie his legs and he will get on. What	107: 46,13E  !
1E	do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is	107: 46,14E  !
1E	not it? Well hung; town built; I have not had it	107: 46,15E  !
1E	a month. It was built for a Christchurch man, a friend	107: 46,16E  !
1E	of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ran it a few weeks,	107: 46,17E  !
1E	till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with it.	107: 46,18E  !
1E	I happened just then to be looking out for some light	107: 46,19E  !
1E	thing of the kind, though I had pretty well determined	107: 46,20E  !
1E	on a curricle too; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge,	107: 46,21E  !
1E	as he was driving into Oxford, last term:	107: 46,22E  !
1E	said he,	107: 46,23E  !
1E	""Oh| d@@"", said I, ""I am your	107: 46,25E  !
1E	man; what do you ask?"" And how much do you think	107: 46,26E  !
1E	he did, Miss Morland?"	107: 46,27E  !
1A	"I am sure I cannot guess at all."	107: 46,28A  !
1E	"Curricle-hung you see; seat, trunk, sword-case,	107: 46,29E  !
1E	splashing-board, lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete;	107: 46,30E  !
1E	the iron-work as good as new, or better. He asked	107: 46,31E  !
1E	fifty guineas; I closed with him directly, threw down	107: 46,32E  !
1E	the money, and the carriage was mine."	107: 46,33E  !
1A	"And I am sure,"	107: 46,34A  !
1A	"I know so little of such	107: 46,34A  !
1A	things that I cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear."	107: 46,35A  !
1E	"Neither one nor t'other; I might have got it for less	107: 46,36E  !
1E	I dare say; but I hate haggling, and poor Freeman	107: 46,37E  !
1E	wanted cash."	107: 46,38E  !
1A	"That was very good-natured of you,"	107: 47, 1A  !
1E	"Oh| d@@ it, when one has the means of doing	107: 47, 3E  !
1E	a kind thing by a friend, I hate to be pitiful."	107: 47, 4E  !
1E	"You will find, however, Miss Morland, it would	107: 47,21E  !
1E	be reckoned a cheap thing by some people, for I might	107: 47,22E  !
1E	have sold it for ten guineas more the next day; Jackson of	107: 47,23E  !
1E	Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at	107: 47,24E  !
1E	the time."	107: 47,25E  !
1E	"My horse| oh, d@@ it| I would not sell my horse	107: 47,28E  !
1E	for a hundred. Are you fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?"	107: 47,29E  !
1A	"Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of	107: 47,31A  !
1A	being in one; but I am particularly fond of it."	107: 47,32A  !
1E	"I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day."	107: 47,33E  !
1A	"Thank you,"	107: 47,34A  !
1E	"I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to-morrow."	107: 47,36E  !
1A	"Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?"	107: 47,37A  !
1E	"Rest| he has only come three-and-twenty miles to-day;	107: 47,38E  !
1E	all nonsense; nothing ruins horses so much as	107: 48, 1E  !
1E	rest; nothing knocks them up so soon. No, no; I shall	107: 48, 2E  !
1E	exercise mine at the average of four hours every day	107: 48, 3E  !
1E	while I am here."	107: 48, 4E  !
1A	"Shall you indeed|"	107: 48, 5A  !
1A	"that will be forty miles a day."	107: 48, 6A  !
1E	"Forty| aye fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive	107: 48, 7E  !
1E	you up Lansdown to-morrow; mind, I am engaged."	107: 48, 8E  !
1D	"How delightful that will be|"	107: 48, 9D  !
1D	"my dearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but	107: 48,10D  !
1D	I am afraid, brother, you will not have room for a third."	107: 48,11D  !
1E	"A third indeed| no, no; I did not come to Bath to	107: 48,12E  !
1E	drive my sisters about; that would be a good joke,	107: 48,13E  !
1E	faith| Morland must take care of you."	107: 48,14E  !
1A	"Have you ever read Udolpho,	107: 48,27A  !
1A	Mr% Thorpe?"	107: 48,28A  !
1E	"Udolpho| Oh, Lord| not I; I never read novels;	107: 48,29E  !
1E	I have something else to do."	107: 48,30E  !
1E	"Novels	107: 48,32E  !
1E	are all so full of nonsense and stuff; there has not been	107: 48,33E  !
1E	a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones, except	107: 48,34E  !
1E	the Monk; I read that t'other day; but as for all the	107: 48,35E  !
1E	others, they are the stupidest things in creation."	107: 48,36E  !
1A	"I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read	107: 48,37A  !
1A	it; it is so very interesting."	107: 48,38A  !
1E	"Not I, faith| No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs% Radcliff's;	107: 49, 1E  !
1E	her novels are amusing enough; they are	107: 49, 2E  !
1E	worth reading; some fun and nature in \them\."	107: 49, 3E  !
1A	"Udolpho was written by Mrs% Radcliff,"	107: 49, 4A  !
1E	"No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was;	107: 49, 6E  !
1E	I was thinking of that other stupid book, written by that	107: 49, 7E  !
1E	woman they make such a fuss about, she who married	107: 49, 8E  !
1E	the French emigrant."	107: 49, 9E  !
1A	"I suppose you mean Camilla?"	107: 49,10A  !
1E	"Yes, that's the book; such unnatural stuff|~ An	107: 49,11E  !
1E	old man playing at see-saw| I took up the first volume	107: 49,12E  !
1E	once, and looked it over, but I soon found it would not	107: 49,13E  !
1E	do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before	107: 49,14E  !
1E	I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant,	107: 49,15E  !
1E	I was sure I should never be able to get through it."	107: 49,16E  !
1A	"I have never read it."	107: 49,17A  !
1E	"You had no loss I assure you; it is the horridest	107: 49,18E  !
1E	nonsense you can imagine; there is nothing in the world	107: 49,19E  !
1E	in it but an old man's playing at see-saw and learning	107: 49,20E  !
1E	Latin; upon my soul there is not."	107: 49,21E  !
1E	"Ah, mother| how do you do?"	107: 49,28E  !
1E	"where did you	107: 49,29E  !
1E	get that quiz of a hat, it makes you look like an old	107: 49,30E  !
1E	witch? Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days	107: 49,31E  !
1E	with you, so you must look out for a couple of good beds	107: 49,32E  !
1E	some where near."	107: 49,33E  !
1A	"I like him very much; he seems very agreeable."	107: 50,19A  !
1A	"Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly."	107: 50,23A  !
1A	"Indeed I am,"	107: 50,32A  !
1A	"I love her exceedingly,	107: 50,32A  !
1A	and am delighted to find that you like her too. You	107: 50,33A  !
1A	hardly mentioned any thing of her, when you wrote to	107: 50,34A  !
1A	me after your visit there."	107: 50,35A  !
1A	"Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr% Allen thinks	107: 51, 4A  !
1A	her the prettiest girl in Bath."	107: 51, 5A  !
1A	"Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and	107: 51,12A  !
1A	now you are come it will be more delightful than ever;	107: 51,13A  !
1A	how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see \me\."	107: 51,14A  !
1D	"I assure you,"	108: 52,18D  !
1D	"I would not	108: 52,18D  !
1D	stand up without your dear sister for all the world; for	108: 52,19D  !
1D	if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening."	108: 52,20D  !
1D	"My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you, your	108: 52,25D  !
1D	brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you	108: 52,26D  !
1D	will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will	108: 52,27D  !
1D	be back in a moment, and then you may easily find me	108: 52,28D  !
1D	out."	108: 52,29D  !
1D	"Good bye, my dear love,"	108: 52,32D  !
1B	"And I hope, madam, that Mr% Allen will be obliged	108: 54,22B  !
1B	to like the place, from finding it of service to him."	108: 54,23B  !
1B	"That circumstance must give great encouragement."	108: 54,27B  !
1D	"At last I have got you. My	108: 56,22D  !
1D	dearest creature, I have been looking for you this hour.	108: 56,23D  !
1D	What could induce you to come into this set, when you	108: 56,24D  !
1D	knew I was in the other? I have been quite wretched	108: 56,25D  !
1D	without you."	108: 56,26D  !
1A	"My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get	108: 56,27A  !
1A	at you? I could not even see where you were."	108: 56,28A  !
1D	"So I told your brother all the time ~ but he would	108: 56,29D  !
1D	not believe me. Do go and see for her, Mr% Morland, said	108: 56,30D  !
1D	I ~ but all in vain ~ he would not stir an inch. Was not	108: 56,31D  !
1D	it so, Mr% Morland? But you men are all so immoderately	108: 56,32D  !
1D	lazy| I have been scolding him to such a degree, my dear	108: 56,33D  !
1D	Catherine, you would be quite amazed.~ You know	108: 56,34D  !
1D	I never stand upon ceremony with such people."	108: 56,35D  !
1A	"Look at that young lady with the white beads round	108: 56,36A  !
1A	her head,"	108: 56,37A  !
1A	"It is Mr% Tilney's sister."	108: 56,38A  !
1D	"Oh| heavens| You don't say so| Let me look at	108: 57, 1D  !
1D	her this moment. What a delightful girl| I never saw	108: 57, 2D  !
1D	any thing half so beautiful| But where is her all-conquering	108: 57, 3D  !
1D	brother? Is he in the room? Point him out to me	108: 57, 4D  !
1D	this instant, if he is. I die to see him. Mr% Morland, you	108: 57, 5D  !
1D	are not to listen. We are not talking about you."	108: 57, 6D  !
1D	"There now, I knew how it would be. You men have	108: 57, 9D  !
1D	such restless curiosity| Talk of the curiosity of women,	108: 57,10D  !
1D	indeed|~ 'tis nothing. But be satisfied, for you are not	108: 57,11D  !
1D	to know any thing at all of the matter."	108: 57,12D  !
1D	"Well, I declare I never knew any thing like you.	108: 57,14D  !
1D	What can it signify to you, what we are talking of?	108: 57,15D  !
1D	Perhaps we are talking about you, therefore I would	108: 57,16D  !
1D	advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear	108: 57,17D  !
1D	some thing not very agreeable."	108: 57,18D  !
1D	"I tell you, Mr% Morland,"	108: 57,26D  !
1D	"I would	108: 57,26D  !
1D	not do such a thing for all the world. How can you be so	108: 57,27D  !
1D	teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your	108: 57,28D  !
1D	brother wants me to do. He wants me to dance with him	108: 57,29D  !
1D	again, though I tell him that it is a most improper	108: 57,30D  !
1D	thing, and entirely against the rules. It would make	108: 57,31D  !
1D	us the talk of the place, if we were not to change	108: 57,32D  !
1D	partners."	108: 57,33D  !
1D	"Nonsense, how can you say so? But when you men	108: 57,36D  !
1D	have a point to carry, you never stick at any thing. My	108: 57,37D  !
1D	sweet Catherine, do support me, persuade your brother	108: 57,38D  !
1D	how impossible it is. Tell him, that it would quite shock	108: 58, 1D  !
1D	you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?"	108: 58, 2D  !
1A	"No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had	108: 58, 3A  !
1A	much better change."	108: 58, 4A  !
1D	"There,"	108: 58, 5D  !
1D	"you hear what your sister	108: 58, 5D  !
1D	says, and yet you will not mind her. Well, remember	108: 58, 6D  !
1D	that it is not my fault, if we set all the old ladies in Bath	108: 58, 7D  !
1D	in a bustle. Come along, my dearest Catherine, for	108: 58, 8D  !
1D	heaven's sake, and stand by me."	108: 58, 9D  !
1A	"Very agreeable, madam."	108: 58,20A  !
1A	"No, where is he?"	108: 58,25A  !
1A	"Where can he be?"	108: 58,30A  !
1E	"Well, Miss Morland, I suppose	108: 59,10E  !
1E	you and I are to stand up and jig it together again."	108: 59,11E  !
1A	"Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances	108: 59,12A  !
1A	are over; and, besides, I am tired, and do not mean to	108: 59,13A  !
1A	dance any more."	108: 59,14A  !
1E	"Do not you?~ then let us walk about and quiz	108: 59,15E  !
1E	people. Come along with me, and I will shew you the	108: 59,16E  !
1E	four greatest quizzers in the room; my two younger	108: 59,17E  !
1E	sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them	108: 59,18E  !
1E	this half hour."	108: 59,19E  !
1D	"dearest Catherine."	108: 59,28D  !
1E	"Well, Miss Morland, here	109: 61, 6E  !
1E	I am. Have you been waiting long? We could not come	109: 61, 7E  !
1E	before; the old devil of a coachmaker was such an	109: 61, 8E  !
1E	eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into, and now	109: 61, 9E  !
1E	it is ten thousand to one, but they break down before we	109: 61,10E  !
1E	are out of the street. How do you do, Mrs% Allen?	109: 61,11E  !
1E	a famous ball last night, was not it? Come, Miss Morland,	109: 61,12E  !
1E	be quick, for the others are in a confounded hurry to be	109: 61,13E  !
1E	off. They want to get their tumble over."	109: 61,14E  !
1A	"What do you mean?"	109: 61,15A  !
1A	"where are	109: 61,15A  !
1A	you all going to?"	109: 61,16A  !
1E	"Going to? why, you have not forgot our engagement|	109: 61,17E  !
1E	Did not we agree together to take a drive this morning?	109: 61,18E  !
1E	What a head you have| We are going up Claverton Down."	109: 61,19E  !
1A	"Some thing was said about it, I remember,"	109: 61,21A  !
1A	"but	109: 61,22A  !
1A	really I did not expect you."	109: 61,23A  !
1E	"Not expect me| that's a good one| And what	109: 61,24E  !
1E	a dust you would have made, if I had not come."	109: 61,25E  !
1A	"Well, ma'am, what do you say to it? Can	109: 61,35A  !
1A	you spare me for an hour or two? shall I go?"	109: 61,36A  !
1D	"My dearest	109: 62, 6D  !
1D	creature,"	109: 62, 7D  !
1D	"you have been at least three hours getting	109: 62, 9D  !
1D	ready. I was afraid you were ill. What a delightful ball	109: 62,10D  !
1D	we had last night. I have a thousand things to say to	109: 62,11D  !
1D	you; but make haste and get in, for I long to be off."	109: 62,12D  !
1D	"What a sweet girl she is| I quite doat on her."	109: 62,15D  !
1E	"You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,"	109: 62,16E  !
1E	"if my horse should dance	109: 62,17E  !
1E	about a little at first setting off. He will, most likely,	109: 62,18E  !
1E	give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest for a	109: 62,19E  !
1E	minute; but he will soon know his master. He is full	109: 62,20E  !
1E	of spirits, playful as can be, but there is no vice in him."	109: 62,21E  !
1E	let him go,"	109: 62,29E  !
1E	"Old Allen is	109: 63,13E  !
1E	as rich as a Jew ~ is not he?"	109: 63,14E  !
1E	"Old Allen, the man you are with."	109: 63,16E  !
1A	"Oh| Mr% Allen, you mean. Yes, I believe, he is very	109: 63,17A  !
1A	rich."	109: 63,18A  !
1E	"And no children at all?"	109: 63,19E  !
1A	"No ~ not any."	109: 63,20A  !
1E	"A famous thing for his next heirs. He is \your\ godfather,	109: 63,21E  !
1E	is not he?"	109: 63,22E  !
1A	"My godfather|~ no."	109: 63,23A  !
1E	"But you are always very much with them."	109: 63,24E  !
1A	"Yes, very much."	109: 63,25A  !
1E	"Aye, that is what I meant. He seems a good kind of	109: 63,26E  !
1E	old fellow enough, and has lived very well in his time,	109: 63,27E  !
1E	I dare say; he is not gouty for nothing. Does he drink	109: 63,28E  !
1E	his bottle a-day now?"	109: 63,29E  !
1A	"His bottle a-day|~ no. Why should you think of	109: 63,30A  !
1A	such a thing? He is a very temperate man, and you	109: 63,31A  !
1A	could not fancy him in liquor last night?"	109: 63,32A  !
1E	"Lord help you|~ You women are always thinking of	109: 63,33E  !
1E	men's being in liquor. Why you do not suppose a man	109: 63,34E  !
1E	is overset by a bottle? I am sure of \this\~ that if every body	109: 63,35E  !
1E	was to drink their bottle a-day, there would not be	109: 63,36E  !
1E	half the disorders in the world there are now. It would	109: 63,37E  !
1E	be a famous good thing for us all."	109: 63,38E  !
1A	"I cannot believe it."	109: 64, 1A  !
1E	"Oh| lord, it would be the saving of thousands. There	109: 64, 2E  !
1E	is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this	109: 64, 3E  !
1E	kingdom, that there ought to be. Our foggy climate	109: 64, 4E  !
1E	wants help."	109: 64, 5E  !
1A	"And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of	109: 64, 6A  !
1A	wine drank in Oxford."	109: 64, 7A  !
1E	"Oxford| There is no drinking at Oxford now, I	109: 64, 8E  !
1E	assure you. Nobody drinks there. You would hardly	109: 64, 9E  !
1E	meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the	109: 64,10E  !
1E	utmost. Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable	109: 64,11E  !
1E	thing at the last party in my rooms, that upon an average	109: 64,12E  !
1E	we cleared about five pints a head. It was looked upon	109: 64,13E  !
1E	as something out of the common way. \Mine\ is famous	109: 64,14E  !
1E	good stuff to be sure. You would not often meet with	109: 64,15E  !
1E	any thing like it in Oxford ~ and that may account for it.	109: 64,16E  !
1E	But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of	109: 64,17E  !
1E	drinking there."	109: 64,18E  !
1A	"Yes, it does give a notion,"	109: 64,19A  !
1A	"and that is, that you all drink a great deal more wine	109: 64,20A  !
1A	than I thought you did. However, I am sure James does	109: 64,21A  !
1A	not drink so much."	109: 64,22A  !
1A	"You do not	109: 65, 6A  !
1A	really think, Mr% Thorpe,"	109: 65, 7A  !
1A	"that James's	109: 65, 9A  !
1A	gig will break down?"	109: 65,10A  !
1E	"Break down| Oh| lord| Did you ever see such	109: 65,11E  !
1E	a little tittuppy thing in your life? There is not a sound	109: 65,12E  !
1E	piece of iron about it. The wheels have been fairly worn	109: 65,13E  !
1E	out these ten years at least ~ and as for the body| Upon	109: 65,14E  !
1E	my soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with	109: 65,15E  !
1E	a touch. It is the most devilish little ricketty business	109: 65,16E  !
1E	I ever beheld|~ Thank God| we have got a better.	109: 65,17E  !
1E	I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty	109: 65,18E  !
1E	thousand pounds."	109: 65,19E  !
1A	"Good heavens|"	109: 65,20A  !
1A	"then pray let us turn back; they will certainly meet	109: 65,21A  !
1A	with an accident if we go on. Do let us turn back, Mr% Thorpe;	109: 65,22A  !
1A	stop and speak to my brother, and tell him	109: 65,23A  !
1A	how very unsafe it is."	109: 65,24A  !
1E	"Unsafe| Oh, lord| what is there in that? they will	109: 65,25E  !
1E	only get a roll if it does break down; and there is plenty	109: 65,26E  !
1E	of dirt, it will be excellent falling. Oh, curse it| the	109: 65,27E  !
1E	carriage is safe enough, if a man knows how to drive it;	109: 65,28E  !
1E	a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty	109: 65,29E  !
1E	years after it is fairly worn out. Lord bless you| I would	109: 65,30E  !
1E	undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back	109: 65,31E  !
1E	again, without losing a nail."	109: 65,32E  !
1D	"Past three o'clock|"	109: 67,12D  !
1A	"Yes, ma'am, I thank you; we could not have had	109: 68, 1A  !
1A	a nicer day."	109: 68, 2A  !
1A	"You have seen Mrs% Thorpe then?"	109: 68, 5A  !
1A	"Did you see any body else of our acquaintance?"	109: 68,10A  !
1A	"Did you indeed? and did they speak to you?"	109: 68,14A  !
1A	"And what did she tell you of them?"	109: 68,20A  !
1A	"Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they	109: 68,23A  !
1A	come from?"	109: 68,24A  !
1A	"And are Mr% and Mrs% Tilney in Bath?"	109: 68,33A  !
1A	"And is Mr% Tilney, my partner, the only son?"	109: 69, 4A  !
1D	"Oh, heavens| my beloved Catherine, have I got you at	110: 70, 7D  !
1D	last?"	110: 70, 8D  !
1D	"Now, Mr% Morland,"	110: 70, 9D  !
1D	"I shall not speak another	110: 70,10D  !
1D	word to you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you	110: 70,11D  !
1D	not to expect it. My sweetest Catherine, how have you	110: 70,12D  !
1D	been this long age? but I need not ask you, for you look	110: 70,13D  !
1D	delightfully. You really have done your hair in a more	110: 70,14D  !
1D	heavenly style than ever: you mischievous creature, do	110: 70,15D  !
1D	you want to attract every body? I assure you, my	110: 70,16D  !
1D	brother is quite in love with you already; and as for	110: 70,17D  !
1D	Mr% Tilney ~ but \that\ is a settled thing ~ even \your\ modesty	110: 70,18D  !
1D	cannot doubt his attachment now; his coming back to	110: 70,19D  !
1D	Bath makes it too plain. Oh| what would not I give to	110: 70,20D  !
1D	see him| I really am quite wild with impatience. My	110: 70,21D  !
1D	mother says he is the most delightful young man in the	110: 70,22D  !
1D	world; she saw him this morning you know: you must	110: 70,23D  !
1D	introduce him to me. Is he in the house now?~ Look	110: 70,24D  !
1D	about for heaven's sake| I assure you, I can hardly	110: 70,25D  !
1D	exist till I see him."	110: 70,26D  !
1A	"No,"	110: 70,27A  !
1A	"he is not here; I cannot see	110: 70,27A  !
1A	him any where."	110: 70,28A  !
1D	"Oh, horrid| am I never to be acquainted with him?	110: 70,29D  !
1D	How do you like my gown? I think it does not look	110: 70,30D  !
1D	amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own thought. Do	110: 70,31D  !
1D	you know I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your	110: 70,32D  !
1D	brother and I were agreeing this morning that, though it	110: 70,33D  !
1D	is vastly well to be here for a few weeks, we would not	110: 71, 1D  !
1D	live here for millions. We soon found out that our tastes	110: 71, 2D  !
1D	were exactly alike in preferring the country to every	110: 71, 3D  !
1D	other place; really, our opinions were so exactly the	110: 71, 4D  !
1D	same, it was quite ridiculous| There was not a single	110: 71, 5D  !
1D	point in which we differed; I would not have had you	110: 71, 6D  !
1D	by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am sure	110: 71, 7D  !
1D	you would have made some droll remark or other about it."	110: 71, 8D  !
1A	"No, indeed I should not."	110: 71, 9A  !
1D	"Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than	110: 71,10D  !
1D	you know yourself. You would have told us that we	110: 71,11D  !
1D	seemed born for each other, or some nonsense of that	110: 71,12D  !
1D	kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception;	110: 71,13D  !
1D	my cheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would	110: 71,14D  !
1D	not have had you by for the world."	110: 71,15D  !
1A	"Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made	110: 71,16A  !
1A	so improper a remark upon any account; and besides,	110: 71,17A  !
1A	I am sure it would never have entered my head."	110: 71,18A  !
1A	"How well your brother dances|"	110: 72,28A  !
1C	"Henry|"	110: 72,32C  !
1C	"Yes, he does	110: 72,32C  !
1C	dance very well."	110: 72,33C  !
1A	"He must have thought it very odd to hear me say	110: 72,34A  !
1A	I was engaged the other evening, when he saw me sitting	110: 72,35A  !
1A	down. But I really had been engaged the whole day to	110: 72,36A  !
1A	Mr% Thorpe."	110: 72,37A  !
1A	"You	110: 72,37A  !
1A	cannot think,"	110: 72,38A  !
1A	"how surprized I was to see him again. I felt so sure	110: 73, 1A  !
1A	of his being quite gone away."	110: 73, 2A  !
1C	"When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before,	110: 73, 3C  !
1C	he was in Bath but for a couple of days. He came only	110: 73, 4C  !
1C	to engage lodgings for us."	110: 73, 5C  !
1A	"\That\ never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing	110: 73, 6A  !
1A	him any where, I thought he must be gone. Was not the	110: 73, 7A  !
1A	young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith?"	110: 73, 8A  !
1C	"Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs% Hughes."	110: 73, 9C  !
1A	"I dare say she was very glad to dance. Do you think	110: 73,10A  !
1A	her pretty?"	110: 73,11A  !
1C	"Not very."	110: 73,12C  !
1A	"He never comes to the Pump-room, I suppose?"	110: 73,13A  !
1C	"Yes, sometimes; but he has rid out this morning	110: 73,14C  !
1C	with my father."	110: 73,15C  !
1A	"I hope I shall have the pleasure	110: 73,17A  !
1A	of seeing you again soon,"	110: 73,18A  !
1A	"Shall you	110: 73,18A  !
1A	be at the cotillion ball to-morrow?"	110: 73,19A  !
1C	"Perhaps we ~ yes, I think we certainly shall."	110: 73,20C  !
1A	"I am glad of it, for we shall all be there." ~	110: 73,21A  !
1D	"Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine,"	110: 74,38D  !
1D	"but I am really going to dance with your	110: 75, 1D  !
1D	brother again. I declare positively it is quite shocking.	110: 75, 2D  !
1D	I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, but you and	110: 75, 3D  !
1D	John must keep us in countenance. Make haste, my dear	110: 75, 4D  !
1D	creature, and come to us. John is just walked off, but he	110: 75, 5D  !
1D	will be back in a moment."	110: 75, 6D  !
1E	"Hey-day,	110: 75,26E  !
1E	Miss Morland|"	110: 75,27E  !
1E	"what is the meaning of	110: 75,27E  !
1E	this?~ I thought you and I were to dance together."	110: 75,28E  !
1A	"I wonder you should think so, for you never asked	110: 75,29A  !
1A	me."	110: 75,30A  !
1E	"That is a good one, by Jove|~ I asked you as	110: 75,30E  !
1E	soon as I came into the room, and I was just going to	110: 75,31E  !
1E	ask you again, but when I turned round, you were gone|	110: 75,32E  !
1E	~ this is a cursed shabby trick| I only came for the sake	110: 75,33E  !
1E	of dancing with \you\, and I firmly believe you were	110: 75,34E  !
1E	engaged to me ever since Monday. Yes; I remember,	110: 75,35E  !
1E	I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your	110: 75,36E  !
1E	cloak. And here have I been telling all my acquaintance	110: 75,37E  !
1E	that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the	110: 75,38E  !
1E	room; and when they see you standing up with somebody	110: 76, 1E  !
1E	else, they will quiz me famously."	110: 76, 2E  !
1A	"Oh, no; they will never think of \me\, after such	110: 76, 3A  !
1A	a description as that."	110: 76, 4A  !
1E	"By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of	110: 76, 5E  !
1E	the room for blockheads. What chap have you there?"	110: 76, 6E  !
1E	"Tilney,"	110: 76, 7E  !
1E	"Hum ~ I do not know him. A good figure of a man;	110: 76, 8E  !
1E	well put together.~ Does he want a horse?~ Here is	110: 76, 9E  !
1E	a friend of mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that	110: 76,10E  !
1E	would suit any body. A famous clever animal for the	110: 76,11E  !
1E	road ~ only forty guineas. I had fifty minds to buy it	110: 76,12E  !
1E	myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good	110: 76,13E  !
1E	horse when I meet with one; but it would not answer	110: 76,14E  !
1E	my purpose, it would not do for the field. I would give	110: 76,15E  !
1E	any money for a real good hunter. I have three now, the	110: 76,16E  !
1E	best that ever were back'd. I would not take eight	110: 76,17E  !
1E	hundred guineas for them. Fletcher and I mean to get	110: 76,18E  !
1E	a house in Leicestershire, against the next season. It is	110: 76,19E  !
1E	so d@@ uncomfortable, living at an inn."	110: 76,20E  !
1B	"That gentleman	110: 76,24B  !
1B	would have put me out of patience, had he staid with	110: 76,25B  !
1B	you half a minute longer. He has no business to withdraw	110: 76,26B  !
1B	the attention of my partner from me. We have	110: 76,27B  !
1B	entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the	110: 76,28B  !
1B	space of an evening, and all our agreeableness belongs	110: 76,29B  !
1B	solely to each other for that time. Nobody can fasten	110: 76,30B  !
1B	themselves on the notice of one, without injuring the	110: 76,31B  !
1B	rights of the other. I consider a country-dance as an	110: 76,32B  !
1B	emblem of marriage. Fidelity and complaisance are	110: 76,33B  !
1B	the principal duties of both; and those men who	110: 76,34B  !
1B	do not chuse to dance or marry themselves, have no	110: 76,35B  !
1B	business with the partners or wives of their neighbours."	110: 76,36B  !
1A	"But they are such very different things|~"	110: 76,38A  !
1B	"~ That you think they cannot be compared together."	110: 77, 1B  !
1A	"To be sure not. People that marry can never part,	110: 77, 3A  !
1A	but must go and keep house together. People that dance,	110: 77, 4A  !
1A	only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an	110: 77, 5A  !
1A	hour."	110: 77, 6A  !
1B	"And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing.	110: 77, 7B  !
1B	Taken in that light certainly, their resemblance is	110: 77, 8B  !
1B	not striking; but I think I could place them in such	110: 77, 9B  !
1B	a view.~ You will allow, that in both, man has the	110: 77,10B  !
1B	advantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal;	110: 77,11B  !
1B	that in both, it is an engagement between man and	110: 77,12B  !
1B	woman, formed for the advantage of each; and that when	110: 77,13B  !
1B	once entered into, they belong exclusively to each other	110: 77,14B  !
1B	till the moment of its dissolution; that it is their duty,	110: 77,15B  !
1B	each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing	110: 77,16B  !
1B	that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere, and	110: 77,17B  !
1B	their best interest to keep their own imaginations from	110: 77,18B  !
1B	wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours, or	110: 77,19B  !
1B	fancying that they should have been better off with any one	110: 77,20B  !
1B	else. You will allow all this?"	110: 77,21B  !
1A	"Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very	110: 77,22A  !
1A	well; but still they are so very different.~ I cannot look	110: 77,23A  !
1A	upon them at all in the same light, nor think the same	110: 77,24A  !
1A	duties belong to them."	110: 77,25A  !
1B	"In one respect, there certainly is a difference. In	110: 77,26B  !
1B	marriage, the man is supposed to provide for the support	110: 77,27B  !
1B	of the woman; the woman to make the home agreeable	110: 77,28B  !
1B	to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile. But in	110: 77,29B  !
1B	dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness,	110: 77,30B  !
1B	the compliance are expected from him, while she	110: 77,31B  !
1B	furnishes the fan and the lavender water. \That\, I suppose,	110: 77,32B  !
1B	was the difference of duties which struck you, as rendering	110: 77,33B  !
1B	the conditions incapable of comparison."	110: 77,34B  !
1A	"No, indeed, I never thought of that."	110: 77,35A  !
1B	"Then I am quite at a loss. One thing, however,	110: 77,36B  !
1B	I must observe. This disposition on your side is rather	110: 77,37B  !
1B	alarming. You totally disallow any similarity in the	110: 77,38B  !
1B	obligations; and may I not thence infer, that your	110: 78, 1B  !
1B	notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict	110: 78, 2B  !
1B	as your partner might wish? Have I not reason to fear,	110: 78, 3B  !
1B	that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to	110: 78, 4B  !
1B	return, or if any other gentleman were to address you,	110: 78, 5B  !
1B	there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing	110: 78, 6B  !
1B	with him as long as you chose?"	110: 78, 7B  !
1A	"Mr% Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my	110: 78, 8A  !
1A	brother's, that if he talks to me, I must talk to him	110: 78, 9A  !
1A	again; but there are hardly three young men in the room	110: 78,10A  !
1A	besides him, that I have any acquaintance with."	110: 78,11A  !
1B	"And is that to be my only security? alas, alas|"	110: 78,12B  !
1A	"Nay, I am sure you cannot have a better; for if I do	110: 78,13A  !
1A	not know any body, it is impossible for me to talk to	110: 78,14A  !
1A	them; and, besides, I do not \want\ to talk to any body."	110: 78,15A  !
1B	"Now you have given me a security worth having;	110: 78,16B  !
1B	and I shall proceed with courage. Do you find Bath as	110: 78,17B  !
1B	agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry	110: 78,18B  !
1B	before?"	110: 78,19B  !
1A	"Yes, quite ~ more so, indeed."	110: 78,20A  !
1B	"More so|~ Take care, or you will forget to be tired	110: 78,21B  !
1B	of it at the proper time.~ You ought to be tired at the	110: 78,22B  !
1B	end of six weeks."	110: 78,23B  !
1A	"I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here	110: 78,24A  !
1A	six months."	110: 78,25A  !
1B	"Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and	110: 78,26B  !
1B	so every body finds out every year.	110: 78,27B  !
1B	You would be	110: 78,29B  !
1B	told so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly	110: 78,30B  !
1B	every winter, lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve,	110: 78,31B  !
1B	and go away at last because they can afford to stay no	110: 78,32B  !
1B	longer."	110: 78,33B  !
1A	"Well, other people must judge for themselves, and	110: 78,34A  !
1A	those who go to London may think nothing of Bath.	110: 78,35A  !
1A	But I, who live in a small retired village in the country,	110: 78,36A  !
1A	can never find greater sameness in such a place as this,	110: 78,37A  !
1A	than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements,	110: 78,38A  !
1A	a variety of things to be seen and done all day	110: 79, 1A  !
1A	long, which I can know nothing of there."	110: 79, 2A  !
1B	"You are not fond of the country."	110: 79, 3B  !
1A	"Yes, I am. I have always lived there, and always	110: 79, 4A  !
1A	been very happy. But certainly there is much more	110: 79, 5A  !
1A	sameness in a country life than in a Bath life. One day	110: 79, 6A  !
1A	in the country is exactly like another."	110: 79, 7A  !
1B	"But then you spend your time so much more rationally	110: 79, 8B  !
1B	in the country."	110: 79, 9B  !
1A	"Do I?"	110: 79,10A  !
1B	"Do you not?"	110: 79,11B  !
1A	"I do not believe there is much difference."	110: 79,12A  !
1B	"Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day	110: 79,13B  !
1B	long."	110: 79,14B  !
1A	"And so I am at home ~ only I do not find so much	110: 79,15A  !
1A	of it. I walk about here, and so I do there;~ but here	110: 79,16A  !
1A	I see a variety of people in every street, and there I can	110: 79,17A  !
1A	only go and call on Mrs% Allen."	110: 79,18A  !
1B	"Only go and call	110: 79,19B  !
1B	on Mrs% Allen|"	110: 79,20B  !
1B	"What a picture of intellectual	110: 79,20B  !
1B	poverty| However, when you sink into this	110: 79,21B  !
1B	abyss again, you will have more to say. You will be able	110: 79,22B  !
1B	to talk of Bath, and of all that you did here."	110: 79,23B  !
1A	"Oh| yes. I shall never be in want of something to	110: 79,24A  !
1A	talk of again to Mrs% Allen, or any body else. I really	110: 79,25A  !
1A	believe I shall always be talking of Bath, when I am at	110: 79,26A  !
1A	home again ~ I \do\ like it so very much. If I could but	110: 79,27A  !
1A	have papa and mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose	110: 79,28A  !
1A	I should be too happy| James's coming (my eldest	110: 79,29A  !
1A	brother) is quite delightful ~ and especially as it turns	110: 79,30A  !
1A	out, that the very family we are just got so intimate with,	110: 79,31A  !
1A	are his intimate friends already. Oh| who can ever be	110: 79,32A  !
1A	tired of Bath?"	110: 79,33A  !
1B	"Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort	110: 79,34B  !
1B	to it, as you do. But papas and mammas, and brothers	110: 79,35B  !
1B	and intimate friends are a good deal gone by, to most of	110: 79,36B  !
1B	the frequenters of Bath ~ and the honest relish of balls	110: 79,37B  !
1B	and plays, and every-day sights, is past with them."	110: 79,38B  !
1B	"I see that you guess what I have just been asked.	110: 80,15B  !
1B	That gentleman knows your name, and you have a right	110: 80,16B  !
1B	to know his. It is General Tilney, my father."	110: 80,17B  !
1A	"Oh|" ~	110: 80,18A  !
1A	"I shall	110: 80,32A  !
1A	like it,"	110: 80,33A  !
1A	"beyond any thing in the world; and	110: 80,33A  !
1A	do not let us put it off ~ let us go to-morrow."	110: 80,34A  !
1A	"remember ~ twelve o'clock,"	110: 80,38A  !
1A	"Oh| dear, I do believe it will be wet,"	111: 82,16A  !
1A	"No walk for me to-day,"	111: 82,19A  !
1A	"but	111: 82,19A  !
1A	perhaps it may come to nothing, or it may hold up before	111: 82,20A  !
1A	twelve."	111: 82,21A  !
1A	"Oh| that will not signify; I never mind dirt."	111: 82,24A  !
1A	"It comes on faster and faster|"	111: 82,27A  !
1A	"There are four umbrellas up already. How I hate the	111: 82,31A  !
1A	sight of an umbrella|"	111: 82,32A  !
1A	"It was such a nice looking morning| I felt so convinced	111: 83, 3A  !
1A	it would be dry|"	111: 83, 4A  !
1A	"I do not quite despair yet. I shall not give it up till	111: 83,18A  !
1A	a quarter after twelve. This is just the time of day for	111: 83,19A  !
1A	it to clear up, and I do think it looks a little lighter.	111: 83,20A  !
1A	There, it is twenty minutes after twelve, and now I \shall\	111: 83,21A  !
1A	give it up entirely. Oh| that we had such weather here	111: 83,22A  !
1A	as they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the	111: 83,23A  !
1A	South of France|~ the night that poor St% Aubin died|~	111: 83,24A  !
1A	such beautiful weather|"	111: 83,25A  !
1A	"Isabella, my brother, and Mr% Thorpe, I declare|	111: 84, 8A  !
1A	They are coming for me perhaps ~ but I shall not go ~	111: 84, 9A  !
1A	I cannot go indeed, for you know Miss Tilney may still	111: 84,10A  !
1A	call."	111: 84,11A  !
1E	"Make haste| make haste|"	111: 84,14E  !
1E	"put on your hat this moment ~ there is no	111: 84,15E  !
1E	time to be lost ~ we are going to Bristol.~ How d'ye do,	111: 84,16E  !
1E	Mrs% Allen?"	111: 84,17E  !
1A	"To Bristol| Is not that a great way off?~ But, however,	111: 84,18A  !
1A	I cannot go with you to-day, because I am engaged;	111: 84,19A  !
1A	I expect some friends every moment."	111: 84,20A  !
1D	"My sweetest	111: 84,23D  !
1D	Catherine, is not this delightful? We shall have a most	111: 84,24D  !
1D	heavenly drive. You are to thank your brother and me	111: 84,25D  !
1D	for the scheme; it darted into our heads at breakfast-time,	111: 84,26D  !
1D	I verily believe at the same instant; and we should	111: 84,27D  !
1D	have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this	111: 84,28D  !
1D	detestable rain. But it does not signify, the nights are	111: 84,29D  !
1D	moonlight, and we shall do delightfully. Oh| I am in	111: 84,30D  !
1D	such extasies at the thoughts of a little country air and	111: 84,31D  !
1D	quiet|~ so much better than going to the Lower Rooms.	111: 84,32D  !
1D	We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there; and,	111: 84,33D  !
1D	as soon as dinner is over, if there is time for it, go on to	111: 84,34D  !
1D	Kingsweston."	111: 84,35D  !
1E	"You croaking fellow|"	111: 84,37E  !
1E	"we shall be	111: 84,37E  !
1E	able to do ten times more. Kingsweston| aye, and Blaize Castle	111: 84,38E  !
1E	too, and any thing else we can hear of; but here	111: 85, 1E  !
1E	is your sister says she will not go."	111: 85, 2E  !
1A	"Blaize Castle|"	111: 85, 3A  !
1A	"what is that?"	111: 85, 3A  !
1E	"The finest place in England ~ worth going fifty miles	111: 85, 4E  !
1E	at any time to see."	111: 85, 5E  !
1A	"What, is it really a castle, an old castle?"	111: 85, 6A  !
1E	"The oldest in the kingdom."	111: 85, 7E  !
1A	"But is it like what one reads of?"	111: 85, 8A  !
1E	"Exactly ~ the very same."	111: 85, 9E  !
1A	"But now really ~ are there towers and long galleries?"	111: 85,10A  !
1E	"By dozens."	111: 85,12E  !
1A	"Then I should like to see it; but I cannot ~ I	111: 85,13A  !
1A	cannot go."	111: 85,14A  !
1D	"Not go|~ my beloved creature, what do you mean?"	111: 85,15D  !
1A	"I cannot go, because" ~	111: 85,16A  !
1A	"I expect Miss Tilney	111: 85,17A  !
1A	and her brother to call on me to take a country walk.	111: 85,18A  !
1A	They promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but	111: 85,19A  !
1A	now, as it is so fine, I dare say they will be here soon."	111: 85,20A  !
1E	"Not they indeed,"	111: 85,21E  !
1E	"for, as we turned	111: 85,21E  !
1E	into Broad-street, I saw them ~ does he not drive a	111: 85,22E  !
1E	phaeton with bright chesnuts?"	111: 85,23E  !
1A	"I do not know indeed."	111: 85,24A  !
1E	"Yes, I know he does; I saw him. You are talking	111: 85,25E  !
1E	of the man you danced with last night, are not you?"	111: 85,26E  !
1A	"Yes."	111: 85,27A  !
1E	"Well, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road,	111: 85,28E  !
1E	~ driving a smart-looking girl."	111: 85,29E  !
1A	"Did you indeed?"	111: 85,30A  !
1E	"Did upon my soul; knew him again directly, and he	111: 85,31E  !
1E	seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too."	111: 85,32E  !
1A	"It is very odd| but I suppose they thought it would	111: 85,33A  !
1A	be too dirty for a walk."	111: 85,34A  !
1E	"And well they might, for I never saw so much dirt in	111: 85,35E  !
1E	my life. Walk| you could no more walk than you could	111: 85,36E  !
1E	fly| it has not been so dirty the whole winter; it is	111: 85,37E  !
1E	ancle-deep every where."	111: 85,38E  !
1D	"My dearest Catherine, you	111: 86, 1D  !
1D	cannot form an idea of the dirt; come, you must go;	111: 86, 2D  !
1D	you cannot refuse going now."	111: 86, 3D  !
1A	"I should like to see the castle; but may we go all	111: 86, 4A  !
1A	over it? may we go up every staircase, and into every	111: 86, 5A  !
1A	suite of rooms?"	111: 86, 6A  !
1E	"Yes, yes, every hole and corner."	111: 86, 7E  !
1A	"But then,~ if they should only be gone out for an	111: 86, 8A  !
1A	hour till it is drier, and call by and bye?"	111: 86, 9A  !
1E	"Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for	111: 86,10E  !
1E	I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing	111: 86,11E  !
1E	by on horseback, that they were going as far as Wick Rocks."	111: 86,12E  !
1A	"Then I will. Shall I go, Mrs% Allen?"	111: 86,14A  !
1E	"Who is that girl who looked at	111: 87, 5E  !
1E	you so hard as she went by?"	111: 87, 6E  !
1A	"Who?~ where?"	111: 87, 7A  !
1E	"On the right-hand pavement ~ she must be almost	111: 87, 8E  !
1E	out of sight now."	111: 87, 9E  !
1A	"Stop, stop, Mr% Thorpe,"	111: 87,12A  !
1A	"it is	111: 87,12A  !
1A	Miss Tilney; it is indeed.~ How could you tell me they	111: 87,13A  !
1A	were gone?~ Stop, stop, I will get out this moment and	111: 87,14A  !
1A	go to them."	111: 87,15A  !
1A	"Pray, pray	111: 87,21A  !
1A	stop, Mr% Thorpe.~ I cannot go on.~ I will not go on.~	111: 87,22A  !
1A	I must go back to Miss Tilney."	111: 87,23A  !
1A	"How could you deceive me	111: 87,28A  !
1A	so, Mr% Thorpe?~ How could you say, that you saw	111: 87,29A  !
1A	them driving up the Lansdown-road?~ I would not have	111: 87,30A  !
1A	had it happen so for the world.~ They must think it so	111: 87,31A  !
1A	strange; so rude of me| to go by them, too, without	111: 87,32A  !
1A	saying a word| You do not know how vexed I am.~	111: 87,33A  !
1A	I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor in any thing else.	111: 87,34A  !
1A	I had rather, ten thousand times rather get out now, and	111: 87,35A  !
1A	walk back to them. How could you say, you saw them	111: 87,36A  !
1A	driving out in a phaeton?"	111: 87,37A  !
1E	"It is all one to me,"	111: 88,31E  !
1E	"If your brother had not got such a d@@ beast to	111: 88,34E  !
1E	drive,"	111: 88,35E  !
1E	"we might have done it	111: 88,35E  !
1E	very well. My horse would have trotted to Clifton within	111: 88,36E  !
1E	the hour, if left to himself, and I have almost broke my	111: 88,37E  !
1E	arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken-winded	111: 88,38E  !
1E	jade's pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and	111: 89, 1E  !
1E	gig of his own."	111: 89, 2E  !
1A	"No, he is not,"	111: 89, 3A  !
1A	"for I am	111: 89, 3A  !
1A	sure he could not afford it."	111: 89, 4A  !
1E	"And why cannot he afford it?"	111: 89, 5E  !
1A	"Because he has not money enough."	111: 89, 6A  !
1E	"And whose fault is that?"	111: 89, 7E  !
1A	"Nobody's, that I know of."	111: 89, 8A  !
1D	"How	111: 89,37D  !
1D	I pity the poor creatures that are going there| How	111: 89,38D  !
1D	glad I am that I am not amongst them| I wonder	111: 90, 1D  !
1D	whether it will be a full ball or not| They have not	111: 90, 2D  !
1D	begun dancing yet. I would not be there for all the world.	111: 90, 3D  !
1D	It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to	111: 90, 4D  !
1D	oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know	111: 90, 5D  !
1D	the Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity every body	111: 90, 6D  !
1D	that is. But I dare say, Mr% Morland, you long to	111: 90, 7D  !
1D	be at it, do not you? I am sure you do. Well, pray	111: 90, 8D  !
1D	do not let any body here be a restraint on you. I dare	111: 90, 9D  !
1D	say we could do very well without you; but you men	111: 90,10D  !
1D	think yourselves of such consequence."	111: 90,11D  !
1D	"Do	111: 90,15D  !
1D	not be so dull, my dearest creature,"	111: 90,16D  !
1D	"You will quite break my heart. It was amazingly	111: 90,17D  !
1D	shocking to be sure; but the Tilneys were entirely to	111: 90,18D  !
1D	blame. Why were not they more punctual? It was	111: 90,19D  !
1D	dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure	111: 90,20D  !
1D	John and I should not have minded it. I never mind	111: 90,21D  !
1D	going through any thing, where a friend is concerned;	111: 90,22D  !
1D	that is my disposition, and John is just the same; he has	111: 90,23D  !
1D	amazing strong feelings. Good heavens| what a delightful	111: 90,24D  !
1D	hand you have got| Kings, I vow| I never was so	111: 90,25D  !
1D	happy in my life| I would fifty times rather you should	111: 90,26D  !
1D	have them than myself."	111: 90,27D  !
1A	"Mrs% Allen,"	112: 91, 1A  !
1A	"will	112: 91, 1A  !
1A	there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney to-day?	112: 91, 2A  !
1A	I shall not be easy till I have explained every thing."	112: 91, 3A  !
1A	"Oh| Mr% Tilney, I have been quite wild to	112: 93,25A  !
1A	speak to you, and make my apologies. You must have	112: 93,26A  !
1A	thought me so rude; but indeed it was not my own	112: 93,27A  !
1A	fault,~ was it, Mrs% Allen? Did not they tell me that	112: 93,28A  !
1A	Mr% Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton	112: 93,29A  !
1A	together? and then what could I do? But I had ten	112: 93,30A  !
1A	thousand times rather have been with you; now had not	112: 93,31A  !
1A	I, Mrs% Allen?"	112: 93,32A  !
1B	"We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing	112: 94, 1B  !
1B	us a pleasant walk after our passing you in Argyle-street:	112: 94, 2B  !
1B	you were so kind as to look back on purpose."	112: 94, 3B  !
1A	"But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk;	112: 94, 4A  !
1A	I never thought of such a thing; but I begged Mr% Thorpe	112: 94, 5A  !
1A	so earnestly to stop; I called out to him as soon as ever	112: 94, 6A  !
1A	I saw you; now, Mrs% Allen, did not ~ Oh| you were	112: 94, 7A  !
1A	not there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr% Thorpe would	112: 94, 8A  !
1A	only have stopped, I would have jumped out and run	112: 94, 9A  !
1A	after you."	112: 94,10A  !
1A	"Oh| do not say Miss Tilney was	112: 94,15A  !
1A	not angry,"	112: 94,16A  !
1A	"because I know she was;	112: 94,16A  !
1A	for she would not see me this morning when I called;	112: 94,17A  !
1A	I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after	112: 94,18A  !
1A	my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted.	112: 94,19A  !
1A	Perhaps you did not know I had been there."	112: 94,20A  !
1B	"I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from	112: 94,21B  !
1B	Eleanor, and she has been wishing ever since to see you,	112: 94,22B  !
1B	to explain the reason of such incivility; but perhaps	112: 94,23B  !
1B	I can do it as well. It was nothing more than that my	112: 94,24B  !
1B	father ~~ they were just preparing to walk out, and he	112: 94,25B  !
1B	being hurried for time, and not caring to have it put off,	112: 94,26B  !
1B	made a point of her being denied. That was all, I do	112: 94,27B  !
1B	assure you. She was very much vexed, and meant to	112: 94,28B  !
1B	make her apology as soon as possible."	112: 94,29B  !
1A	"But, Mr% Tilney,	112: 94,33A  !
1A	why were \you\ less generous than your sister? If she felt	112: 94,34A  !
1A	such confidence in my good intentions, and could suppose	112: 94,35A  !
1A	it to be only a mistake, why should \you\ be so ready to	112: 94,36A  !
1A	take offence?"	112: 94,37A  !
1B	"Me|~ I take offence|"	112: 94,38B  !
1A	"Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the	112: 95, 1A  !
1A	box, you were angry."	112: 95, 2A  !
1B	"I angry| I could have no right."	112: 95, 3B  !
1A	"Well, nobody would have thought you had no right	112: 95, 4A  !
1A	who saw your face."	112: 95, 5A  !
1A	"How came Mr% Thorpe to know your father?"	112: 95,24A  !
1E	"He is a fine	112: 95,34E  !
1E	old fellow, upon my soul|~ stout, active,~ looks as young	112: 95,35E  !
1E	as his son. I have a great regard for him, I assure you:	112: 95,36E  !
1E	a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived."	112: 95,37E  !
1A	"But how came you to know him?"	112: 95,38A  !
1E	"Know him|~ There are few people much about town	112: 96, 1E  !
1E	that I do not know. I have met him for ever at the	112: 96, 2E  !
1E	Bedford; and I knew his face again to-day the moment	112: 96, 3E  !
1E	he came into the billiard-room. One of the best players	112: 96, 4E  !
1E	we have, by the bye; and we had a little touch together,	112: 96, 5E  !
1E	though I was almost afraid of him at first: the odds were	112: 96, 6E  !
1E	five to four against me; and, if I had not made one of	112: 96, 7E  !
1E	the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this	112: 96, 8E  !
1E	world ~ I took his ball exactly ~ but I could not	112: 96, 9E  !
1E	make you understand it without a table;~ however I \did\	112: 96,10E  !
1E	beat him. A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew. I should	112: 96,11E  !
1E	like to dine with him; I dare say he gives famous dinners.	112: 96,12E  !
1E	But what do you think we have been talking of?~ You.	112: 96,13E  !
1E	Yes, by heavens|~ and the General thinks you the finest	112: 96,14E  !
1E	girl in Bath."	112: 96,15E  !
1A	"Oh| nonsense| how can you say so?"	112: 96,16A  !
1E	"And what do you think I said?"	112: 96,17E  !
1E	"Well done, General, said I, I am quite of your mind."	112: 96,18E  !
1A	"Do not	113: 97,32A  !
1A	urge me, Isabella. I am engaged to Miss Tilney. I cannot	113: 97,33A  !
1A	go."	113: 98, 1A  !
1D	"It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney	113: 98, 3D  !
1D	that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement,	113: 98, 4D  !
1D	and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday."	113: 98, 5D  !
1A	"No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There	113: 98, 6A  !
1A	has been no prior engagement."	113: 98, 7A  !
1D	"I cannot help being jealous, Catherine, when I see	113: 98,22D  !
1D	myself slighted for strangers, I, who love you so excessively|	113: 98,23D  !
1D	When once my affections are placed, it is not	113: 98,24D  !
1D	in the power of any thing to change them. But I believe	113: 98,25D  !
1D	my feelings are stronger than any body's; I am sure	113: 98,26D  !
1D	they are too strong for my own peace; and to see myself	113: 98,27D  !
1D	supplanted in your friendship by strangers, does cut me	113: 98,28D  !
1D	to the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up	113: 98,29D  !
1D	every thing else."	113: 98,30D  !
1D	"Very	113: 99,15D  !
1D	well, then there is an end of the party. If Catherine does	113: 99,16D  !
1D	not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I would	113: 99,17D  !
1D	not, upon any account in the world, do so improper	113: 99,18D  !
1D	a thing."	113: 99,19D  !
1A	"But why cannot Mr% Thorpe drive one of his other	113: 99,21A  !
1A	sisters? I dare say either of them would like to go."	113: 99,22A  !
1E	"Thank ye,"	113: 99,23E  !
1E	"but I did not come to	113: 99,23E  !
1E	Bath to drive my sisters about, and look like a fool. No,	113: 99,24E  !
1E	if you do not go, d@@ me if I do. I only go for the sake	113: 99,25E  !
1E	of driving you."	113: 99,26E  !
1A	"That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure."	113: 99,27A  !
1A	"I hope I am not less so now,"	113:100, 3A  !
1A	"but indeed I cannot go. If I am wrong, I am	113:100, 4A  !
1A	doing what I believe to be right."	113:100, 5A  !
1D	"I suspect,"	113:100, 6D  !
1D	"there is no	113:100, 6D  !
1D	great struggle."	113:100, 7D  !
1E	"Well, I have	113:100,11E  !
1E	settled the matter, and now we may all go to-morrow	113:100,12E  !
1E	with a safe conscience. I have been to Miss Tilney, and	113:100,13E  !
1E	made your excuses."	113:100,14E  !
1A	"You have not|"	113:100,15A  !
1E	"I have, upon my soul. Left her this moment. Told	113:100,16E  !
1E	her you had sent me to say, that having just recollected	113:100,17E  !
1E	a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us to-morrow,	113:100,18E  !
1E	you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till	113:100,19E  !
1E	Tuesday. She said	113:100,20E  !
1E	so there is an end of all our difficulties. ~	113:100,21E  !
1E	A pretty good thought of mine ~ hey?"	113:100,22E  !
1D	"A most heavenly thought indeed| Now, my sweet	113:100,25D  !
1D	Catherine, all our distresses are over; you are honourably	113:100,26D  !
1D	acquitted, and we shall have a most delightful party."	113:100,27D  !
1A	"This will not do,"	113:100,28A  !
1A	"I cannot submit	113:100,28A  !
1A	to this. I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set	113:100,29A  !
1A	her right."	113:100,30A  !
1A	"I do not care. Mr% Thorpe had no business to invent	113:100,37A  !
1A	any such message. If I had thought it right to put it off,	113:100,38A  !
1A	I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself. This is only	113:101, 1A  !
1A	doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know that Mr% Thorpe	113:101, 2A  !
1A	has ~ he may be mistaken again perhaps; he	113:101, 3A  !
1A	led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday.	113:101, 4A  !
1A	Let me go, Mr% Thorpe; Isabella, do not hold me."	113:101, 5A  !
1A	"Then I will go after them,"	113:101,10A  !
1A	"wherever	113:101,10A  !
1A	they are I will go after them. It does not signify	113:101,11A  !
1A	talking. If I could not be persuaded into doing what	113:101,12A  !
1A	I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it."	113:101,13A  !
1E	"She is as obstinate as ~~."	113:101,17E  !
1A	"I am come in a great hurry ~ It was all a mistake ~	113:102,14A  !
1A	I never promised to go ~ I told them from the first I could	113:102,15A  !
1A	not go.~ I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.~ I did	113:102,16A  !
1A	not care what you thought of me.~ I would not stay for	113:102,17A  !
1A	the servant."	113:102,18A  !
1A	"No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney	113:104, 6A  !
1A	before they told me of it; and therefore you know	113:104, 7A  !
1A	I could not go with them, could I?"	113:104, 8A  !
1A	"Dear madam,"	113:104,30A  !
1A	"then why did not	113:104,30A  !
1A	you tell me so before? I am sure if I had known it to	113:104,31A  !
1A	be improper, I would not have gone with Mr% Thorpe at	113:104,32A  !
1A	all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought	113:104,33A  !
1A	I was doing wrong."	113:104,34A  !
1A	"But this was something of real consequence; and	113:105, 5A  !
1A	I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade."	113:105, 6A  !
1A	"I never look at it,"	114:106,16A  !
1A	"without thinking of the south	114:106,17A  !
1A	of France."	114:106,18A  !
1B	"You have been abroad then?"	114:106,19B  !
1A	"Oh| no, I only mean what I have read about. It	114:106,21A  !
1A	always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and	114:106,22A  !
1A	her father travelled through, in the ""Mysteries of Udolpho.""	114:106,23A  !
1A	But you never read novels, I dare say?"	114:106,24A  !
1B	"Why not?"	114:106,25B  !
1A	"Because they are not clever enough for you ~ gentlemen	114:106,26A  !
1A	read better books."	114:106,27A  !
1B	"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not	114:106,28B  !
1B	pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.	114:106,29B  !
1B	I have read all Mrs% Radcliffe's works, and most of them	114:106,30B  !
1B	with great pleasure. The Mysteries of Udolpho, when	114:106,31B  !
1B	I had once begun it, I could not lay down again;~ I remember	114:106,32B  !
1B	finishing it in two days ~ my hair standing on	114:106,33B  !
1B	end the whole time."	114:106,34B  !
1C	"Yes,"	114:107, 1C  !
1C	"and I remember that you	114:107, 1C  !
1C	undertook to read it aloud to me, and that when I was	114:107, 2C  !
1C	called away for only five minutes to answer a note, instead	114:107, 3C  !
1C	of waiting for me, you took the volume into the Hermitage-walk,	114:107, 4C  !
1C	and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it."	114:107, 5C  !
1B	"Thank you, Eleanor; ~ a most honourable testimony.	114:107, 6B  !
1B	You see, Miss Morland, the injustice of your suspicions.	114:107, 7B  !
1B	Here was I, in my eagerness to get on, refusing to wait	114:107, 8B  !
1B	only five minutes for my sister; breaking the promise	114:107, 9B  !
1B	I had made of reading it aloud, and keeping her in suspense	114:107,10B  !
1B	at a most interesting part, by running away with the	114:107,11B  !
1B	volume, which, you are to observe, was her own, particularly	114:107,12B  !
1B	her own. I am proud when I reflect on it, and	114:107,13B  !
1B	I think it must establish me in your good opinion."	114:107,14B  !
1A	"I am very glad to hear it indeed, and now I shall	114:107,15A  !
1A	never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself. But I really	114:107,16A  !
1A	thought before, young men despised novels amazingly."	114:107,17A  !
1B	"It is \amazingly\; it may well suggest \amazement\ if	114:107,18B  !
1B	they do ~ for they read nearly as many as women. I	114:107,19B  !
1B	myself have read hundreds and hundreds. Do not	114:107,20B  !
1B	imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of	114:107,21B  !
1B	Julias and Louisas. If we proceed to particulars, and	114:107,22B  !
1B	engage in the never-ceasing inquiry of ""Have you read	114:107,23B  !
1B	this?"" and ""Have you read that?"" I shall soon leave	114:107,24B  !
1B	you as far behind me as ~ what shall I say?~ I want an	114:107,25B  !
1B	appropriate simile;~ as far as your friend Emily herself	114:107,26B  !
1B	left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into	114:107,27B  !
1B	Italy. Consider how many years I have had the start of	114:107,28B  !
1B	you. I had entered on my studies at Oxford, while you	114:107,29B  !
1B	were a good little girl working your sampler at home|"	114:107,30B  !
1A	"Not very good I am afraid. But now really, do not	114:107,31A  !
1A	you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world?"	114:107,32A  !
1B	"The nicest;~ by which I suppose you mean the	114:107,33B  !
1B	neatest. That must depend upon the binding."	114:107,34B  !
1C	"Henry,"	114:107,35C  !
1C	"you are very impertinent.	114:107,35C  !
1C	Miss Morland, he is treating you exactly as he does his	114:107,36C  !
1C	sister. He is for ever finding fault with me, for some	114:107,37C  !
1C	incorrectness of language, and now he is taking the same	114:107,38C  !
1C	liberty with you. The word ""nicest"", as you used it, did	114:108, 1C  !
1C	not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as	114:108, 2C  !
1C	you can, or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and	114:108, 3C  !
1C	Blair all the rest of the way."	114:108, 4C  !
1A	"I am sure,"	114:108, 5A  !
1A	"I did not mean to say	114:108, 5A  !
1A	any thing wrong; but it \is\ a nice book, and why should	114:108, 6A  !
1A	not I call it so?"	114:108, 7A  !
1B	"Very true,"	114:108, 8B  !
1B	"and this is a very nice day,	114:108, 8B  !
1B	and we are taking a very nice walk, and you are two very	114:108, 9B  !
1B	nice young ladies. Oh| it is a very nice word indeed|~	114:108,10B  !
1B	it does for every thing. Originally perhaps it was applied	114:108,11B  !
1B	only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or refinement;~	114:108,12B  !
1B	people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments,	114:108,13B  !
1B	or their choice. But now every commendation on every	114:108,14B  !
1B	subject is comprised in that one word."	114:108,15B  !
1C	"While, in fact,"	114:108,16C  !
1C	"it ought only to be	114:108,16C  !
1C	applied to you, without any commendation at all. You	114:108,17C  !
1C	are more nice than wise. Come, Miss Morland, let us	114:108,18C  !
1C	leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost	114:108,19C  !
1C	propriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever	114:108,20C  !
1C	terms we like best. It is a most interesting work. You	114:108,21C  !
1C	are fond of that kind of reading?"	114:108,22C  !
1A	"To say the truth, I do not much like any other."	114:108,23A  !
1C	"Indeed|"	114:108,24C  !
1A	"That is, I can read poetry and plays, and things of	114:108,25A  !
1A	that sort, and do not dislike travels. But history, real	114:108,26A  !
1A	solemn history, I cannot be interested in. Can you?"	114:108,27A  !
1C	"Yes, I am fond of history."	114:108,28C  !
1A	"I wish I were too. I read it a little as a duty, but it	114:108,29A  !
1A	tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me.	114:108,30A  !
1A	The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences,	114:108,31A  !
1A	in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and	114:108,32A  !
1A	hardly any women at all ~ it is very tiresome: and yet	114:108,33A  !
1A	I often think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great	114:108,34A  !
1A	deal of it must be invention. The speeches that are put	114:108,35A  !
1A	into the heroes' mouths, their thoughts and designs ~ the	114:108,36A  !
1A	chief of all this must be invention, and invention is what	114:108,37A  !
1A	delights me in other books."	114:108,38A  !
1C	"Historians, you think,"	114:109, 1C  !
1C	"are not	114:109, 1C  !
1C	happy in their flights of fancy. They display imagination	114:109, 2C  !
1C	without raising interest. I am fond of history ~ and	114:109, 3C  !
1C	am very well contented to take the false with the true.	114:109, 4C  !
1C	In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in	114:109, 5C  !
1C	former histories and records, which may be as much	114:109, 6C  !
1C	depended on, I conclude, as any thing that does not	114:109, 7C  !

1C	the little embellishments you speak of, they are embellishments,	114:109, 9C  !
1C	and I like them as such. If a speech be well drawn	114:109,10C  !
1C	up, I read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be	114:109,11C  !
1C	made ~ and probably with much greater, if the production	114:109,12C  !
1C	of Mr% Hume or Mr% Robertson, than if the genuine words	114:109,13C  !
1C	of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the Great."	114:109,14C  !
1A	"You are fond of history| ~ and so are Mr% Allen and	114:109,15A  !
1A	my father; and I have two brothers who do not dislike	114:109,16A  !
1A	it. So many instances within my small circle of friends	114:109,17A  !
1A	is remarkable| At this rate, I shall not pity the writers	114:109,18A  !
1A	of history any longer. If people like to read their books,	114:109,19A  !
1A	it is all very well, but to be at so much trouble in filling	114:109,20A  !
1A	great volumes, which, as I used to think, nobody would	114:109,21A  !
1A	willingly ever look into, to be labouring only for the	114:109,22A  !
1A	torment of little boys and girls, always struck me as	114:109,23A  !
1A	a hard fate; and though I know it is all very right and	114:109,24A  !
1A	necessary, I have often wondered at the person's courage	114:109,25A  !
1A	that could sit down on purpose to do it."	114:109,26A  !
1B	"That little boys and girls should be tormented,"	114:109,27B  !
1B	"is what no one at all acquainted with human	114:109,28B  !
1B	nature in a civilized state can deny; but in behalf of our	114:109,29B  !
1B	most distinguished historians, I must observe, that they	114:109,30B  !
1B	might well be offended at being supposed to have no	114:109,31B  !
1B	higher aim; and that by their method and style, they are	114:109,32B  !
1B	perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most	114:109,33B  !
1B	advanced reason and mature time of life. I use the verb	114:109,34B  !
1B	""to torment"", as I observed to be your own method,	114:109,35B  !
1B	instead of ""to instruct,"" supposing them to be now	114:109,36B  !
1B	admitted as synonimous."	114:109,37B  !
1A	"You think me foolish to call instruction a torment,	114:109,38A  !
1A	but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor	114:110, 1A  !
1A	little children first learning their letters and then learning	114:110, 2A  !
1A	to spell, if you had ever seen how stupid they can be	114:110, 3A  !
1A	for a whole morning together, and how tired my poor	114:110, 4A  !
1A	mother is at the end of it, as I am in the habit of seeing	114:110, 5A  !
1A	almost every day of my life at home, you would allow	114:110, 6A  !
1A	that to \torment\ and to \instruct\ might sometimes be used	114:110, 7A  !
1A	as synonimous words."	114:110, 8A  !
1B	"Very probably. But historians are not accountable	114:110, 9B  !
1B	for the difficulty of learning to read; and even you yourself,	114:110,10B  !
1B	who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to	114:110,11B  !
1B	very severe, very intense application, may perhaps be	114:110,12B  !
1B	brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while	114:110,13B  !
1B	to be tormented for two or three years of one's life, for	114:110,14B  !
1B	the sake of being able to read all the rest of it. Consider ~	114:110,15B  !
1B	if reading had not been taught Mrs% Radcliffe would have	114:110,16B  !
1B	written in vain ~ or perhaps might not have written	114:110,17B  !
1B	at all."	114:110,18B  !
1A	"I have	114:112, 1A  !
1A	heard that something very shocking indeed, will soon	114:112, 2A  !
1A	come out in London."	114:112, 3A  !
1C	"Indeed|~ and of what	114:112, 5C  !
1C	nature?"	114:112, 6C  !
1A	"That I do not know, nor who is the author. I have	114:112, 7A  !
1A	only heard that it is to be more horrible than any thing	114:112, 8A  !
1A	we have met with yet."	114:112, 9A  !
1C	"Good heaven|~ Where could you hear of such a	114:112,10C  !
1C	thing?"	114:112,11C  !
1A	"A particular friend of mine had an account of it in	114:112,12A  !
1A	a letter from London yesterday. It is to be uncommonly	114:112,13A  !
1A	dreadful. I shall expect murder and every thing of the	114:112,14A  !
1A	kind."	114:112,15A  !
1C	"You speak with astonishing composure| But I hope	114:112,16C  !
1C	your friend's accounts have been exaggerated;~ and if	114:112,17C  !
1C	such a design is known beforehand, proper measures will	114:112,18C  !
1C	undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its	114:112,19C  !
1C	coming to effect."	114:112,20C  !
1C	"Government,"	114:112,21C  !
1B	"neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters.	114:112,22B  !

1B	puzzle out an explanation as you can? No ~ I will be	114:112,27B  !
1B	noble. I will prove myself a man, no less by the generosity	114:112,28B  !
1B	of my soul than the clearness of my head. I have no	114:112,29B  !
1B	patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves	114:112,30B  !
1B	sometimes down to the comprehension of yours. Perhaps	114:112,31B  !
1B	the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute ~	114:112,32B  !
1B	neither vigorous nor keen. Perhaps they may want	114:112,33B  !
1B	observation, discernment, judgment, fire, genius, and	114:112,34B  !
1B	wit."	114:112,35B  !
1C	"Miss Morland, do not mind what he says;~ but have	114:112,36C  !
1C	the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot."	114:112,37C  !
1A	"Riot|~ what riot?"	114:112,38A  !
1B	"My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain.	114:113, 1B  !
1B	The confusion there is scandalous. Miss Morland has	114:113, 2B  !
1B	been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication	114:113, 3B  !
1B	which is shortly to come out, in three duodecimo	114:113, 4B  !
1B	volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each,	114:113, 5B  !
1B	with a frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and	114:113, 6B  !
1B	a lantern ~ do you understand?~ And you, Miss Morland	114:113, 7B  !
1B	~ my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions.	114:113, 8B  !
1B	You talked of expected horrors in London ~ and	114:113, 9B  !
1B	instead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature	114:113,10B  !
1B	would have done, that such words could relate only to	114:113,11B  !
1B	a circulating library, she immediately pictured to herself	114:113,12B  !
1B	a mob of three thousand men assembling in St% George's Fields;	114:113,13B  !
1B	the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the	114:113,14B  !
1B	streets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the	114:113,15B  !
1B	12th Light Dragoons, (the hopes of the nation,) called up	114:113,16B  !
1B	from Northampton to quell the insurgents, and the	114:113,17B  !
1B	gallant Capt% Frederick Tilney, in the moment of charging	114:113,18B  !
1B	at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by a brickbat	114:113,19B  !
1B	from an upper window. Forgive her stupidity. The fears	114:113,20B  !
1B	of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman;	114:113,21B  !
1B	but she is by no means a simpleton in general."	114:113,22B  !
1C	"And now, Henry,"	114:113,23C  !
1C	"that you have made us understand each	114:113,24C  !
1C	other, you may as well make Miss Morland understand	114:113,25C  !
1C	yourself ~ unless you mean to have her think you intolerably	114:113,26C  !
1C	rude to your sister, and a great brute in your	114:113,27C  !
1C	opinion of women in general. Miss Morland is not used	114:113,28C  !

1C	present."	114:113,33C  !
1B	"What am I to do?"	114:113,34B  !
1C	"You know what you ought to do. Clear your character	114:113,35C  !
1C	handsomely before her. Tell her that you think very	114:113,36C  !
1C	highly of the understanding of women."	114:113,37C  !
1B	"Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding	114:113,38B  !

1B	"Miss Morland, no one can think more highly of the	114:114, 5B  !
1B	understanding of women than I do. In my opinion,	114:114, 6B  !
1B	nature has given them so much, that they never find it	114:114, 7B  !
1B	necessary to use more than half."	114:114, 8B  !
1C	"We shall get nothing more serious from him now,	114:114, 9C  !
1C	Miss Morland. He is not in a sober mood. But I do	114:114,10C  !
1C	assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood, if he	114:114,11C  !

1D	my dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has	115:117,10D  !

1D	through every thing."	115:117,12D  !
1D	"Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend,"	115:117,14D  !
1D	"compose yourself.~ I am amazingly agitated, as	115:117,15D  !
1D	you perceive. Let us sit down and talk in comfort. Well,	115:117,16D  !
1D	and so you guessed it the moment you had my note?~	115:117,17D  !
1D	Sly creature|~ Oh| my dear Catherine, you alone who	115:117,18D  !
1D	know my heart can judge of my present happiness. Your	115:117,19D  !
1D	brother is the most charming of men. I only wish I were	115:117,20D  !
1D	more worthy of him.~ But what will your excellent father	115:117,21D  !
1D	and mother say?~ Oh| heavens| when I think of them	115:117,22D  !
1D	I am so agitated|"	115:117,23D  !

1A	Can you ~ can you really be in love with James?"	115:117,28A  !
1D	"You	115:118, 9D  !
1D	will be so infinitely dearer to me, my Catherine, than	115:118,10D  !
1D	either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so much more	115:118,11D  !

1D	"You are so like your dear brother,"	115:118,14D  !
1D	"that I quite doated on you the first moment I saw you.	115:118,15D  !
1D	But so it always is with me; the first moment settles	115:118,16D  !
1D	every thing. The very first day that Morland came to us	115:118,17D  !
1D	last Christmas ~ the very first moment I beheld him ~ my	115:118,18D  !
1D	heart was irrecoverably gone. I remember I wore my	115:118,19D  !
1D	yellow gown, with my hair done up in braids; and when	115:118,20D  !
1D	I came into the drawing-room, and John introduced him,	115:118,21D  !
1D	I thought I never saw any body so handsome before."	115:118,22D  !
1D	"I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that	115:118,27D  !
1D	evening, and wore her puce-coloured sarsenet; and she	115:118,28D  !
1D	looked so heavenly, that I thought your brother must	115:118,29D  !
1D	certainly fall in love with her; I could not sleep a wink	115:118,30D  !
1D	all night for thinking of it. Oh| Catherine, the many	115:118,31D  !
1D	sleepless nights I have had on your brother's account|~	115:118,32D  !
1D	I would not have you suffer half what I have done|	115:118,33D  !
1D	I am grown wretchedly thin I know; but I will not pain	115:118,34D  !
1D	you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of	115:118,35D  !
1D	it. I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually;~ so	115:118,36D  !
1D	unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church|~	115:118,37D  !
1D	But my secret I was always sure would be safe with \you\."	115:118,38D  !

1A	"for	115:119,11A  !
1A	parents to be more kind, or more desirous of their children's	115:119,12A  !
1A	happiness; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately."	115:119,13A  !
1D	"Morland says exactly the same,"	115:119,15D  !
1D	"and yet I dare not expect it; my fortune will be so	115:119,16D  !
1D	small; they never can consent to it. Your brother, who	115:119,17D  !
1D	might marry any body|"	115:119,18D  !
1A	"Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble.~ The difference	115:119,20A  !
1A	of fortune can be nothing to signify."	115:119,21A  !
1D	"Oh| my sweet Catherine, in \your\ generous heart	115:119,22D  !
1D	I know it would signify nothing; but we must not expect	115:119,23D  !
1D	such disinterestedness in many. As for myself, I am sure	115:119,24D  !
1D	I only wish our situations were reversed. Had I the	115:119,25D  !
1D	command of millions, were I mistress of the whole world,	115:119,26D  !
1D	your brother would be my only choice."	115:119,27D  !

1D	"my wishes are so	115:119,35D  !
1D	moderate, that the smallest income in nature would be	115:119,36D  !
1D	enough for me. Where people are really attached,	115:119,37D  !
1D	poverty itself is wealth: grandeur I detest: I would	115:119,38D  !
1D	not settle in London for the universe. A cottage in some	115:120, 1D  !
1D	retired village would be extasy. There are some charming	115:120, 2D  !

1D	talking| I will not allow myself to think of such things,	115:120, 8D  !
1D	till we have your father's answer. Morland says that by	115:120, 9D  !

1D	To-morrow?~ I know I shall never have	115:120,11D  !

1D	so. For Heaven's sake, waste no more time. There, go,	115:120,31D  !
1D	go ~ I insist on it."	115:120,32D  !

1E	"A famous good thing this marrying scheme,	115:122,32E  !
1E	upon my soul| A clever fancy of Morland's and Belle's.	115:122,33E  !
1E	What do you think of it, Miss Morland? \I\ say it is no	115:122,34E  !

1E	you are no enemy to matrimony however. Did you ever	115:122,38E  !
1E	hear the old song, ""Going to one wedding brings on	115:123, 1E  !
1E	another?"" I say, you will come to Belle's wedding,	115:123, 2E  !
1E	I hope."	115:123, 3E  !
1A	"Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her, if	115:123, 4A  !

1E	"And then you know"~	115:123, 6E  !
1E	"I say, then you know, we may	115:123, 7E  !
1E	try the truth of this same old song."	115:123, 8E  !
1A	"May we?~ but I never sing. Well, I wish you a good	115:123, 9A  !
1A	journey. I dine with Miss Tilney to-day, and must now	115:123,10A  !
1A	be going home."	115:123,11A  !
1E	"Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry.~ Who	115:123,12E  !

1E	I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight, and	115:123,14E  !
1E	a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me."	115:123,15E  !

1E	"That is kind of you, however ~ kind and good-natured.~	115:123,18E  !
1E	I shall not forget it in a hurry.~ But you have	115:123,19E  !
1E	more good-nature and all that, than any body living	115:123,20E  !
1E	I believe. A monstrous deal of good-nature, and it is	115:123,21E  !

1A	"Oh| dear, not at all. There are very few people	115:123,35A  !
1A	I am sorry to see. Company is always cheerful."	115:123,36A  !
1E	"That is just my way of thinking. Give me but	115:123,37E  !
1E	a little cheerful company, let me only have the company	115:123,38E  !
1E	of the people I love, let me only be where I like and with	115:124, 1E  !
1E	whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say I.~ And	115:124, 2E  !
1E	I am heartily glad to hear you say the same. But I have	115:124, 3E  !
1E	a notion, Miss Morland, you and I think pretty much	115:124, 4E  !
1E	alike upon most matters."	115:124, 5E  !
1A	"Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought	115:124, 6A  !
1A	of. And as to \most\ \matters\, to say the truth, there are	115:124, 7A  !
1A	not many that I know my own mind about."	115:124, 8A  !
1E	"By Jove, no more do I. It is not my way to bother	115:124, 9E  !
1E	my brains with what does not concern me. My notion	115:124,10E  !
1E	of things is simple enough. Let me only have the girl	115:124,11E  !
1E	I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, and	115:124,12E  !
1E	what care I for all the rest? Fortune is nothing. I am	115:124,13E  !
1E	sure of a good income of my own; and if she had not	115:124,14E  !
1E	a penny, why so much the better."	115:124,15E  !
1A	"Very true. I think like you there. If there is a good	115:124,16A  !
1A	fortune on one side, there can be no occasion for any on	115:124,17A  !
1A	the other. No matter which has it, so that there is enough.	115:124,18A  !
1A	I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another.	115:124,19A  !
1A	And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in	115:124,20A  !
1A	existence.~ Good day.~ We shall be very glad to see you	115:124,21A  !
1A	at Fullerton, whenever it is convenient."	115:124,22A  !
1D	"It was all pride, pride, insufferable haughtiness and	201:129,28D  !
1D	pride|"	201:129,29D  !
1A	"But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no	201:130, 6A  !
1A	superciliousness; she was very civil."	201:130, 7A  !
1D	"Oh| don't defend her| And then the brother, he	201:130, 8D  !
1D	who had appeared so attached to you| Good heavens|	201:130, 9D  !
1D	well, some people's feelings are incomprehensible. And	201:130,10D  !
1D	so he hardly looked once at you the whole day?"	201:130,11D  !
1A	"I do not say so; but he did not seem in good spirits."	201:130,12A  !
1D	"How contemptible| Of all things in the world	201:130,13D  !
1D	inconstancy is my aversion. Let me entreat you never	201:130,14D  !
1D	to think of him again, my dear Catherine; indeed he is	201:130,15D  !
1D	unworthy of you."	201:130,16D  !
1A	"Unworthy| I do not suppose he ever thinks of me."	201:130,17A  !
1D	"That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of	201:130,18D  !
1D	you.~ Such fickleness| Oh| how different to your	201:130,19D  !
1D	brother and to mine| I really believe John has the most	201:130,20D  !
1D	constant heart."	201:130,21D  !
1A	"But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be	201:130,22A  !
1A	impossible for any body to behave to me with greater	201:130,23A  !
1A	civility and attention; it seemed to be his only care to	201:130,24A  !
1A	entertain and make me happy."	201:130,25A  !
1D	"Oh| I know no harm of him; I do not suspect him	201:130,26D  !
1D	of pride. I believe he is a very gentleman-like man.	201:130,27D  !
1D	John thinks very well of him, and John's judgment ~~"	201:130,28D  !
1A	"Well, I shall see how they behave to me this evening;	201:130,29A  !
1A	we shall meet them at the rooms."	201:130,30A  !
1D	"And must I go?"	201:130,31D  !
1A	"Do not you intend it? I thought it was all settled."	201:130,32A  !
1D	"Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse	201:130,33D  !
1D	you nothing. But do not insist upon my being very	201:130,34D  !
1D	agreeable, for my heart, you know, will be some forty	201:130,35D  !
1D	miles off. And as for dancing, do not mention it I beg;	201:130,36D  !
1D	\that\ is quite out of the question. Charles Hodges will	201:130,37D  !
1D	plague me to death I dare say; but I shall cut him very	201:130,38D  !
1D	short. Ten to one but he guesses the reason, and that	201:131, 1D  !
1D	is exactly what I want to avoid, so I shall insist on his	201:131, 2D  !
1D	keeping his conjecture to himself."	201:131, 3D  !
1A	"Your brother will not mind it I know,"	201:132,21A  !
1A	"because I heard him say before, that he hated dancing;	201:132,22A  !
1A	but it was very good-natured in him to think of it. I suppose	201:132,23A  !
1A	he saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied she might	201:132,24A  !
1A	wish for a partner; but he is quite mistaken, for she	201:132,25A  !
1A	would not dance upon any account in the world."	201:132,26A  !
1B	"How very little trouble it	201:132,27B  !
1B	can give you to understand the motive of other people's	201:132,28B  !
1B	actions."	201:132,29B  !
1A	"Why?~ What do you mean?"	201:132,30A  !
1B	"With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be	201:132,31B  !
1B	influenced? What is the inducement most likely to act	201:132,32B  !
1B	upon such a person's feelings, age, situation, and probable	201:132,33B  !
1B	habits of life considered?~ but, how should \I\ be influenced,	201:132,34B  !
1B	what would be \my\ inducement in acting so and so?"	201:132,35B  !
1A	"I do not understand you."	201:132,36A  !
1B	"Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand	201:132,37B  !
1B	you perfectly well."	201:132,38B  !
1A	"Me?~ yes; I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible."	201:133, 1A  !
1B	"Bravo|~ an excellent satire on modern language."	201:133, 3B  !
1A	"But pray tell me what you mean."	201:133, 4A  !
1B	"Shall I indeed?~ Do you really desire it?~ But you	201:133, 5B  !
1B	are not aware of the consequences; it will involve you	201:133, 6B  !
1B	in a very cruel embarrassment, and certainly bring on	201:133, 7B  !
1B	a disagreement between us."	201:133, 8B  !
1A	"No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid."	201:133, 9A  !
1B	"Well then, I only meant that your attributing my	201:133,10B  !
1B	brother's wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good-nature	201:133,11B  !
1B	alone, convinced me of your being superior in	201:133,12B  !
1B	good-nature yourself to all the rest of the world."	201:133,13B  !
1A	"I cannot think how it could happen| Isabella was so	201:133,28A  !
1A	determined not to dance."	201:133,29A  !
1B	"And did Isabella never change her mind before?"	201:133,30B  !
1A	"Oh| but, because ~ and your brother|~ After what	201:133,31A  !
1A	you told him from me, how could he think of going to	201:133,32A  !
1A	ask her?"	201:133,33A  !
1B	"I cannot take surprize to myself on that head. You	201:133,34B  !
1B	bid me be surprized on your friend's account, and therefore	201:133,35B  !
1B	I am; but as for my brother, his conduct in the	201:133,36B  !
1B	business, I must own, has been no more than I believed	201:133,37B  !
1B	him perfectly equal to. The fairness of your friend was	201:133,38B  !
1B	an open attraction; her firmness, you know, could only	201:134, 1B  !
1B	be understood by yourself."	201:134, 2B  !
1A	"You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very	201:134, 3A  !
1A	firm in general."	201:134, 4A  !
1B	"It is as much as should be said of any one. To be	201:134, 5B  !
1B	always firm must be to be often obstinate. When	201:134, 6B  !
1B	properly to relax is the trial of judgment; and, without	201:134, 7B  !
1B	reference to my brother, I really think Miss Thorpe	201:134, 8B  !
1B	has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present	201:134, 9B  !
1B	hour."	201:134,10B  !
1D	"I do not wonder at your	201:134,14D  !
1D	surprize; and I am really fatigued to death. He is such	201:134,15D  !
1D	a rattle|~ Amusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged;	201:134,16D  !
1D	but I would have given the world to sit still."	201:134,17D  !
1A	"Then why did not you?"	201:134,18A  !
1D	"Oh| my dear| it would have looked so particular;	201:134,19D  !
1D	and you know how I abhor doing that. I refused him	201:134,20D  !
1D	as long as I possibly could, but he would take no denial.	201:134,21D  !
1D	You have no idea how he pressed me. I begged him to	201:134,22D  !
1D	excuse me, and get some other partner ~ but no, not he;	201:134,23D  !
1D	after aspiring to my hand, there was nobody else in the	201:134,24D  !
1D	room he could bear to think of; and it was not that he	201:134,25D  !
1D	wanted merely to dance, he wanted to be with \me\. Oh|	201:134,26D  !
1D	such nonsense|~ I told him he had taken a very unlikely	201:134,27D  !
1D	way to prevail upon me; for, of all things in the world,	201:134,28D  !
1D	I hated fine speeches and compliments;~ and so ~~	201:134,29D  !
1D	and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not	201:134,30D  !
1D	stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs% Hughes, who introduced	201:134,31D  !
1D	him, might take it ill if I did not: and your dear	201:134,32D  !
1D	brother, I am sure he would have been miserable if I had	201:134,33D  !
1D	sat down the whole evening. I am so glad it is over|	201:134,34D  !
1D	My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense:	201:134,35D  !
1D	and then,~ being such a smart young fellow, I saw every	201:134,36D  !
1D	eye was upon us."	201:134,37D  !
1A	"He is very handsome indeed."	201:134,38A  !
1D	"Handsome|~ Yes, I suppose he may. I dare say	201:135, 1D  !
1D	people would admire him in general; but he is not at all	201:135, 2D  !
1D	in my style of beauty. I hate a florid complexion and	201:135, 3D  !
1D	dark eyes in a man. However, he is very well. Amazingly	201:135, 4D  !
1D	conceited, I am sure. I took him down several	201:135, 5D  !
1D	times you know in my way."	201:135, 6D  !
1D	"It is very charming indeed,"	201:135,27D  !
1D	"It is not on my own account I wish for more; but	201:135,38D  !
1D	I cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland,	201:136, 1D  !
1D	making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to	201:136, 2D  !
1D	find one in the common necessaries of life. For myself,	201:136, 3D  !
1D	it is nothing; I never think of myself."	201:136, 4D  !
1D	"Nobody can think better of Mr% Morland than I do,	201:136,17D  !
1D	I am sure. But every body has their failing you know,	201:136,18D  !
1D	and every body has a right to do what they like with	201:136,19D  !
1D	their own money."	201:136,20D  !
1A	"I am very sure,"	201:136,21A  !
1A	"that my father has	201:136,21A  !
1A	promised to do as much as he can afford."	201:136,22A  !
1D	"As to that, my sweet	201:136,23D  !
1D	Catherine, there cannot be a doubt, and you know me	201:136,24D  !
1D	well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would	201:136,25D  !
1D	satisfy me. It is not the want of more money that makes	201:136,26D  !
1D	me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money;	201:136,27D  !
1D	and if our union could take place now upon only fifty	201:136,28D  !
1D	pounds a year, I should not have a wish unsatisfied. Ah|	201:136,29D  !
1D	my Catherine, you have found me out. There's the sting.	201:136,30D  !
1D	The long, long, endless two years and half that are to pass	201:136,31D  !
1D	before your brother can hold the living."	201:136,32D  !
1C	"By the end of another	202:138,29C  !
1C	week|"	202:138,30C  !
1C	"Yes, my father can seldom be prevailed on to give	202:138,31C  !
1C	the waters what I think a fair trial. He has been disappointed	202:138,32C  !
1C	of some friends' arrival whom he expected to	202:138,33C  !
1C	meet here, and as he is now pretty well, is in a hurry to	202:139, 1C  !
1C	get home."	202:139, 2C  !
1A	"I am very sorry for it,"	202:139, 3A  !
1A	"if I had known this before ~~"	202:139, 4A  !
1C	"Perhaps,"	202:139, 5C  !
1C	"you would be so good ~ it would make me very happy	202:139, 6C  !
1C	if ~"	202:139, 7C  !
1C	"I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you	202:139,14C  !
1C	came in."	202:139,15C  !
1A	"I will write home directly,"	202:140,12A  !
1A	"and if they do not object, as I dare say they	202:140,13A  !
1A	will not"~	202:140,14A  !
1D	"This is my favourite place,"	203:143,10D  !
1D	"it is so out of the way."	203:143,13D  !
1A	"Do not be uneasy, Isabella. James will soon be here."	203:143,19A  !
1D	"Psha| my dear creature,"	203:143,20D  !
1D	"do not think	203:143,20D  !
1D	me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine	203:143,21D  !
1D	him to my elbow. It would be hideous to be always	203:143,22D  !
1D	together; we should be the jest of the place. And so	203:143,23D  !
1D	you are going to Northanger|~ I am amazingly glad	203:143,24D  !
1D	of it. It is one of the finest old places in England,	203:143,25D  !
1D	I understand. I shall depend upon a most particular	203:143,26D  !
1D	description of it."	203:143,27D  !
1A	"You shall certainly have the best in my power to	203:143,28A  !
1A	give. But who are you looking for? Are your sisters	203:143,29A  !
1A	coming?"	203:143,30A  !
1D	"I am not looking for any body. One's eyes must be	203:143,31D  !
1D	somewhere, and you know what a foolish trick I have	203:143,32D  !
1D	of fixing mine, when my thoughts are an hundred miles off.	203:143,33D  !
1D	I am amazingly absent; I believe I am the most absent	203:144, 1D  !
1D	creature in the world. Tilney says it is always the case	203:144, 2D  !
1D	with minds of a certain stamp."	203:144, 3D  !
1A	"But I thought, Isabella, you had something in	203:144, 4A  !
1A	particular to tell me?"	203:144, 5A  !
1D	"Oh| yes, and so I have. But here is a proof of what	203:144, 6D  !
1D	I was saying. My poor head| I had quite forgot it.	203:144, 7D  !
1D	Well, the thing is this, I have just had a letter from	203:144, 8D  !
1D	John;~ you can guess the contents."	203:144, 9D  !
1A	"No, indeed, I cannot."	203:144,10A  !
1D	"My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected.	203:144,11D  !
1D	What can he write about, but yourself? You know he	203:144,12D  !
1D	is over head and ears in love with you."	203:144,13D  !
1A	"With \me\, dear Isabella|"	203:144,14A  !
1D	"Nay, my sweetest Catherine, this is being quite	203:144,15D  !
1D	absurd| Modesty, and all that, is very well in its way	203:144,16D  !
1D	but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as	203:144,17D  !
1D	becoming. I have no idea of being so overstrained|	203:144,18D  !
1D	It is fishing for compliments. His attentions were such	203:144,19D  !
1D	as a child must have noticed. And it was but half an	203:144,20D  !
1D	hour before he left Bath, that you gave him the most	203:144,21D  !
1D	positive encouragement. He says so in this letter, says	203:144,22D  !
1D	that he as good as made you an offer, and that you	203:144,23D  !
1D	received his advances in the kindest way; and now he	203:144,24D  !
1D	wants me to urge his suit, and say all manner of pretty	203:144,25D  !
1D	things to you. So it is in vain to affect ignorance."	203:144,26D  !
1A	"As to any attentions on	203:144,31A  !
1A	his side, I do declare, upon my honour, I never was	203:144,32A  !
1A	sensible of them for a moment ~ except just his asking me	203:144,33A  !
1A	to dance the first day of his coming. And as to making	203:144,34A  !
1A	me an offer, or any thing like it, there must be some	203:144,35A  !
1A	unaccountable mistake. I could not have misunderstood	203:144,36A  !
1A	a thing of that kind, you know|~ and, as I ever wish to	203:144,37A  !
1A	be believed, I solemnly protest that no syllable of such	203:144,38A  !
1A	a nature ever passed between us. The last half hour	203:145, 1A  !
1A	before he went away|~ It must be all and completely	203:145, 2A  !
1A	a mistake ~ for I did not see him once that whole morning."	203:145, 3A  !
1D	"But \that\ you certainly did, for you spent the whole	203:145, 4D  !
1D	morning in Edgar's Buildings ~ it was the day your	203:145, 5D  !
1D	father's consent came ~ and I am pretty sure that you	203:145, 6D  !
1D	and John were alone in the parlour, some time before you	203:145, 7D  !
1D	left the house."	203:145, 8D  !
1A	"Are you?~ Well, if you say it, it was so, I dare say ~	203:145, 9A  !
1A	but for the life of me, I cannot recollect it.~ I \do\ remember	203:145,10A  !
1A	now being with you, and seeing him as well as the rest ~ but	203:145,11A  !
1A	that we were ever alone for five minutes ~ However, it is	203:145,12A  !
1A	not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass on his	203:145,13A  !
1A	side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection	203:145,14A  !
1A	of it, that I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for	203:145,15A  !
1A	any thing of the kind from him. I am excessively concerned	203:145,16A  !
1A	that he should have any regard for me ~ but	203:145,17A  !
1A	indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side, I never	203:145,18A  !
1A	had the smallest idea of it. Pray undeceive him as soon	203:145,19A  !
1A	as you can, and tell him I beg his pardon ~ that is ~ I do	203:145,20A  !
1A	not know what I ought to say ~ but make him understand	203:145,21A  !
1A	what I mean, in the properest way. I would not speak	203:145,22A  !
1A	disrespectfully of a brother of your's, Isabella, I am sure;	203:145,23A  !
1A	but you know very well that if I could think of one man	203:145,24A  !
1A	more than another ~ \he\ is not the person."	203:145,25A  !
1A	"My dear friend, you must not be angry with	203:145,26A  !
1A	me. I cannot suppose your brother cares so very much	203:145,27A  !
1A	about me. And, you know, we shall be sisters."	203:145,28A  !
1D	"Yes, yes,"	203:145,29D  !
1D	"there are more ways than	203:145,29D  !
1D	one of our being sisters.~ But where am I wandering	203:145,30D  !
1D	to?~ Well, my dear Catherine, the case seems to be, that	203:145,31D  !
1D	you are determined against poor John ~ is not it so?"	203:145,32D  !
1A	"I certainly cannot return his affection, and as certainly	203:145,33A  !
1A	never meant to encourage it."	203:145,34A  !
1D	"Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you	203:145,35D  !
1D	any further. John desired me to speak to you on the	203:145,36D  !
1D	subject, and therefore I have. But I confess, as soon as	203:145,37D  !
1D	I read his letter, I thought it a very foolish, imprudent	203:145,38D  !
1D	business, and not likely to promote the good of either;	203:146, 1D  !
1D	for what were you to live upon, supposing you came	203:146, 2D  !
1D	together? You have both of you something to be sure,	203:146, 3D  !
1D	but it is not a trifle that will support a family now-a-days;	203:146, 4D  !
1D	and after all that romancers may say, there is no doing	203:146, 5D  !
1D	without money. I only wonder John could think of	203:146, 6D  !
1D	it; he could not have received my last."	203:146, 7D  !
1A	"You \do\ acquit me then of any thing wrong?~ You	203:146, 8A  !
1A	are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother,	203:146, 9A  !
1A	never suspected him of liking me till this moment?"	203:146,10A  !
1D	"Oh| as to that,"	203:146,11D  !
1D	"I do	203:146,11D  !
1D	not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs	203:146,12D  !
1D	in time past may have been. All that is best known to	203:146,13D  !
1D	yourself. A little harmless flirtation or so will occur,	203:146,14D  !
1D	and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement	203:146,15D  !
1D	than one wishes to stand by. But you may be assured	203:146,16D  !
1D	that I am the last person in the world to judge you	203:146,17D  !
1D	severely. All those things should be allowed for in	203:146,18D  !
1D	youth and high spirits. What one means one day, you	203:146,19D  !
1D	know, one may not mean the next. Circumstances	203:146,20D  !
1D	change, opinions alter."	203:146,21D  !
1A	"But my opinion of your brother never did alter;	203:146,22A  !
1A	it was always the same. You are describing what never	203:146,23A  !
1A	happened."	203:146,24A  !
1D	"My dearest Catherine,"	203:146,25D  !
1D	"I would not for all the world be	203:146,26D  !
1D	the means of hurrying you into an engagement before	203:146,27D  !
1D	you knew what you were about. I do not think any thing	203:146,28D  !
1D	would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your	203:146,29D  !
1D	happiness merely to oblige my brother, because he is my	203:146,30D  !
1D	brother, and who perhaps after all, you know, might be	203:146,31D  !
1D	just as happy without you, for people seldom know what	203:146,32D  !
1D	they would be at, young men especially, they are so	203:146,33D  !
1D	amazingly changeable, and inconstant. What I say is,	203:146,34D  !
1D	why should a brother's happiness be dearer to me than	203:146,35D  !
1D	a friend's? You know I carry my notions of friendship	203:146,36D  !
1D	pretty high. But, above all things, my dear Catherine,	203:146,37D  !
1D	do not be in a hurry. Take my word for it, that if you	203:146,38D  !
1D	are in too great a hurry, you will certainly live to repent	203:147, 1D  !
1D	it. Tilney says, there is nothing people are so often	203:147, 2D  !
1D	deceived in, as the state of their own affections, and	203:147, 3D  !
1D	I believe he is very right. Ah| here he comes; never	203:147, 4D  !
1D	mind, he will not see us, I am sure."	203:147, 5D  !
1D	"Psha, nonsense|"	203:147,13D  !
1D	"Why do you put such things into my	203:147,14D  !
1D	head? If I could believe it ~ my spirit, you know, is	203:147,15D  !
1D	pretty independent."	203:147,16D  !
1D	"My heart, indeed| What can you have to do with	203:147,19D  !
1D	hearts? You men have none of you any hearts."	203:147,20D  !
1D	"Do they? I am sorry for it; I am sorry they find	203:147,23D  !
1D	any thing so disagreeable in me. I will look another way.	203:147,24D  !
1D	I hope this pleases you,	203:147,25D  !
1D	I hope	203:147,25D  !
1D	your eyes are not tormented now."	203:147,26D  !
1B	"My brother does know it,"	204:150,19B  !
1A	"Does he?~ then why does he stay here?"	204:150,20A  !
1A	"Why do not you	204:150,22A  !
1A	persuade him to go away? The longer he stays, the	204:150,23A  !
1A	worse it will be for him at last. Pray advise him for his	204:150,24A  !
1A	own sake, and for every body's sake, to leave Bath	204:150,25A  !
1A	directly. Absence will in time make him comfortable	204:150,26A  !
1A	again; but he can have no hope here, and it is only	204:150,27A  !
1A	staying to be miserable."	204:150,28A  !
1B	"I am	204:150,28B  !
1B	sure my brother would not wish to do that."	204:150,29B  !
1A	"Then you will persuade him to go away?"	204:150,30A  !
1B	"Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if	204:150,31B  !
1B	I cannot even endeavour to persuade him. I have myself	204:150,32B  !
1B	told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged. He knows what	204:150,33B  !
1B	he is about, and must be his own master."	204:150,34B  !
1A	"No, he does not know what he is about,"	204:150,35A  !
1A	"he does not know the pain he is giving my	204:150,36A  !
1A	brother. Not that James has ever told me so, but I am	204:150,37A  !
1A	sure he is very uncomfortable."	204:150,38A  !
1B	"And are you sure it is my brother's doing?"	204:151, 1B  !
1A	"Yes, very sure."	204:151, 2A  !
1B	"Is it my brother's attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe's	204:151, 3B  !
1B	admission of them, that gives the pain?"	204:151, 4B  !
1A	"Is not it the same thing?"	204:151, 5A  !
1B	"I think Mr% Morland would acknowledge a difference.	204:151, 6B  !
1B	No man is offended by another man's admiration of the	204:151, 7B  !
1B	woman he loves; it is the woman only who can make it	204:151, 8B  !
1B	a torment."	204:151, 9B  !
1A	"Isabella	204:151,10A  !
1A	is wrong. But I am sure she cannot mean to torment,	204:151,11A  !
1A	for she is very much attached to my brother. She has	204:151,12A  !
1A	been in love with him ever since they first met, and	204:151,13A  !
1A	while my father's consent was uncertain, she fretted	204:151,14A  !
1A	herself almost into a fever. You know she must be	204:151,15A  !
1A	attached to him."	204:151,16A  !
1B	"I understand: she is in love with James, and flirts	204:151,17B  !
1B	with Frederick."	204:151,18B  !
1A	"Oh| no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man	204:151,19A  !
1A	cannot flirt with another."	204:151,20A  !
1B	"It is probable that she will neither love so well, nor	204:151,21B  !
1B	flirt so well, as she might do either singly. The gentlemen	204:151,22B  !
1B	must each give up a little."	204:151,23B  !
1A	"Then	204:151,24A  !
1A	you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my	204:151,25A  !
1A	brother?"	204:151,26A  !
1B	"I can have no opinion on that subject."	204:151,27B  !
1A	"But what can your brother mean? If he knows her	204:151,28A  !
1A	engagement, what can he mean by his behaviour?"	204:151,29A  !
1B	"You are a very close questioner."	204:151,30B  !
1A	"Am I?~ I only ask what I want to be told."	204:151,31A  !
1B	"But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?"	204:151,32B  !
1A	"Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother's	204:151,33A  !
1A	heart."	204:151,34A  !
1B	"My brother's heart, as you term it, on the present	204:151,35B  !
1B	occasion, I assure you I can only guess at."	204:151,36B  !
1A	"Well?"	204:151,37A  !
1B	"Well|~ Nay, if it is to be guess-work, let us all guess	204:151,38B  !
1B	for ourselves. To be guided by second-hand conjecture	204:152, 1B  !
1B	is pitiful. The premises are before you. My brother is	204:152, 2B  !
1B	a lively, and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man;	204:152, 3B  !
1B	he has had about a week's acquaintance with your friend,	204:152, 4B  !
1B	and he has known her engagement almost as long as he	204:152, 5B  !
1B	has known her."	204:152, 6B  !
1A	"Well,"	204:152, 7A  !
1A	"\you\ may be able to guess at your brother's	204:152, 8A  !
1A	intentions from all this; but I am sure I cannot. But is	204:152, 9A  !
1A	not your father uncomfortable about it?~ Does not he	204:152,10A  !
1A	want Captain Tilney to go away?~ Sure, if your father	204:152,11A  !
1A	were to speak to him, he would go."	204:152,12A  !
1B	"My dear Miss Morland,"	204:152,13B  !
1B	"in this amiable	204:152,13B  !
1B	solicitude for your brother's comfort, may you not be	204:152,14B  !
1B	a little mistaken? Are you not carried a little too far?	204:152,15B  !
1B	Would he thank you, either on his own account or Miss Thorpe's,	204:152,16B  !
1B	for supposing that her affection, or at least her	204:152,17B  !
1B	good-behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing	204:152,18B  !
1B	of Captain Tilney? Is he safe only in solitude?~ or,	204:152,19B  !
1B	is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by	204:152,20B  !
1B	any one else?~ He cannot think this ~ and you may be	204:152,21B  !
1B	sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say,	204:152,22B  !
1B	""Do not be uneasy,"" because I know that you are so, at	204:152,23B  !
1B	this moment; but be as little uneasy as you can. You	204:152,24B  !
1B	have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother	204:152,25B  !
1B	and your friend; depend upon it therefore, that real	204:152,26B  !
1B	jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it	204:152,27B  !
1B	that no disagreement between them can be of any duration.	204:152,28B  !
1B	Their hearts are open to each other, as neither	204:152,29B  !
1B	heart can be to you; they know exactly what is required	204:152,30B  !
1B	and what can be borne; and you may be certain, that	204:152,31B  !
1B	one will never tease the other beyond what is known to	204:152,32B  !
1B	be pleasant."	204:152,33B  !
1B	"Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us,	204:152,35B  !
1B	he will probably remain but a very short time, perhaps	204:152,36B  !
1B	only a few days behind us. His leave of absence will soon	204:152,37B  !
1B	expire, and he must return to his regiment.~ And what	204:152,38B  !
1B	will then be their acquaintance?~ The mess-room will	204:153, 1B  !
1B	drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight, and she will laugh	204:153, 2B  !
1B	with your brother over poor Tilney's passion for a month."	204:153, 3B  !
1A	"But how can that be?"	205:157,21A  !
1A	"are not	205:157,21A  !
1A	you with her?"	205:157,22A  !
1B	"Northanger is not more than half my home; I have	205:157,23B  !
1B	an establishment at my own house in Woodston, which is	205:157,24B  !
1B	nearly twenty miles from my father's, and some of my	205:157,25B  !
1B	time is necessarily spent there."	205:157,26B  !
1A	"How sorry you must be for that|"	205:157,27A  !
1B	"I am always sorry to leave Eleanor."	205:157,28B  !
1A	"Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must	205:157,29A  !
1A	be so fond of the abbey|~ After being used to such	205:157,30A  !
1A	a home as the abbey, an ordinary parsonage-house must	205:157,31A  !
1A	be very disagreeable."	205:157,32A  !
1B	"You have formed a very favourable	205:157,33B  !
1B	idea of the abbey."	205:157,34B  !
1A	"To be sure I have. Is not it a fine old place, just like	205:157,35A  !
1A	what one reads about?"	205:157,36A  !
1B	"And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors	205:157,37B  !
1B	that a building such as ""what one reads about"" may	205:157,38B  !
1B	produce?~ Have you a stout heart?~ Nerves fit for	205:158, 1B  !
1B	sliding pannels and tapestry?"	205:158, 2B  !
1A	"Oh| yes ~ I do not think I should be easily frightened,	205:158, 3A  !
1A	because there would be so many people in the house ~	205:158, 4A  !
1A	and besides, it has never been uninhabited and left	205:158, 5A  !
1A	deserted for years, and then the family come back to	205:158, 6A  !
1A	it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally	205:158, 7A  !
1A	happens."	205:158, 8A  !
1B	"No, certainly.~ We shall not have to explore our way	205:158, 9B  !
1B	into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood	205:158,10B  !
1B	fire ~ nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of	205:158,11B  !
1B	a room without windows, doors, or furniture. But you	205:158,12B  !
1B	must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever	205:158,13B  !
1B	means) introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is	205:158,14B  !
1B	always lodged apart from the rest of the family. While	205:158,15B  !
1B	they snugly repair to their own end of the house, she is	205:158,16B  !
1B	formally conducted by Dorothy the ancient housekeeper	205:158,17B  !
1B	up a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages,	205:158,18B  !
1B	into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin	205:158,19B  !
1B	died in it about twenty years before. Can you stand such	205:158,20B  !
1B	a ceremony as this? Will not your mind misgive you,	205:158,21B  !
1B	when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber ~ too lofty	205:158,22B  !
1B	and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single	205:158,23B  !
1B	lamp to take in its size ~ its walls hung with tapestry	205:158,24B  !
1B	exhibiting figures as large as life, and the bed, of dark	205:158,25B  !
1B	green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even a funereal	205:158,26B  !
1B	appearance. Will not your heart sink within you?"	205:158,27B  !
1A	"Oh| but this will not happen to me, I am sure."	205:158,28A  !
1B	"How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your	205:158,29B  !
1B	apartment|~ And what will you discern?~ Not tables,	205:158,30B  !
1B	toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers, but on one side perhaps	205:158,31B  !
1B	the remains of a broken lute, on the other a ponderous	205:158,32B  !
1B	chest which no efforts can open, and over the fire-place	205:158,33B  !
1B	the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features	205:158,34B  !
1B	will so incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be	205:158,35B  !
1B	able to withdraw your eyes from it. Dorothy meanwhile,	205:158,36B  !
1B	no less struck by your appearance, gazes on you in great	205:158,37B  !
1B	agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints. To raise	205:158,38B  !
1B	your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose	205:159, 1B  !
1B	that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly	205:159, 2B  !
1B	haunted, and informs you that you will not have a single	205:159, 3B  !
1B	domestic within call. With this parting cordial she	205:159, 4B  !
1B	curtseys off ~ you listen to the sound of her receding	205:159, 5B  !
1B	footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you ~ and	205:159, 6B  !
1B	when, with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door,	205:159, 7B  !
1B	you discover, with increased alarm, that it has no lock."	205:159, 8B  !
1A	"Oh| Mr% Tilney, how frightful|~ This is just like a	205:159, 9A  !
1A	book|~ But it cannot really happen to me. I am sure your	205:159,10A  !
1A	housekeeper is not really Dorothy.~ Well, what then?"	205:159,11A  !
1B	"Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first	205:159,12B  !
1B	night. After surmounting your \unconquerable\ horror of	205:159,13B  !
1B	the bed, you will retire to rest, and get a few hours'	205:159,14B  !
1B	unquiet slumber. But on the second, or at farthest the	205:159,15B  !
1B	\third\ night after your arrival, you will probably have	205:159,16B  !
1B	a violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to	205:159,17B  !
1B	shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the	205:159,18B  !
1B	neighbouring mountains ~ and during the frightful gusts	205:159,19B  !
1B	of wind which accompany it, you will probably think you	205:159,20B  !
1B	discern (for your lamp is not extinguished) one part of	205:159,21B  !
1B	the hanging more violently agitated than the rest. Unable	205:159,22B  !
1B	of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable	205:159,23B  !
1B	a moment for indulging it, you will instantly arise, and	205:159,24B  !
1B	throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to	205:159,25B  !
1B	examine this mystery. After a very short search, you	205:159,26B  !
1B	will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed	205:159,27B  !
1B	as to defy the minutest inspection, and on	205:159,28B  !
1B	opening it, a door will immediately appear ~ which door	205:159,29B  !
1B	being only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will,	205:159,30B  !
1B	after a few efforts, succeed in opening,~ and, with your	205:159,31B  !
1B	lamp in your hand, will pass through it into a small	205:159,32B  !
1B	vaulted room."	205:159,33B  !
1A	"No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do	205:159,34A  !
1A	any such thing."	205:159,35A  !
1B	"What| not when Dorothy has given you to understand	205:159,36B  !
1B	that there is a secret subterraneous communication	205:159,37B  !
1B	between your apartment and the chapel of St% Anthony,	205:159,38B  !
1B	scarcely two miles off ~ Could you shrink from so simple	205:160, 1B  !
1B	an adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small	205:160, 2B  !
1B	vaulted room, and through this into several others,	205:160, 3B  !
1B	without perceiving any thing very remarkable in either.	205:160, 4B  !
1B	In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another a few	205:160, 5B  !
1B	drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument	205:160, 6B  !
1B	of torture; but there being nothing in all this out	205:160, 7B  !
1B	of the common way, and your lamp being nearly exhausted,	205:160, 8B  !
1B	you will return towards your own apartment. In repassing	205:160, 9B  !
1B	through the small vaulted room, however, your eyes	205:160,10B  !
1B	will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of	205:160,11B  !
1B	ebony and gold, which, though narrowly examining the	205:160,12B  !
1B	furniture before, you had passed unnoticed. Impelled by	205:160,13B  !
1B	an irresistible presentiment, you will eagerly advance to	205:160,14B  !
1B	it, unlock its folding doors, and search into every drawer;	205:160,15B  !
1B	~ but for some time without discovering any thing of	205:160,16B  !
1B	importance ~ perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard	205:160,17B  !
1B	of diamonds. At last, however, by touching a secret	205:160,18B  !
1B	spring, an inner compartment will open ~ a roll of paper	205:160,19B  !
1B	appears:~ you seize it ~ it contains many sheets of manuscript	205:160,20B  !
1B	~ you hasten with the precious treasure into your	205:160,21B  !
1B	own chamber, but scarcely have you been able to decipher	205:160,22B  !
1B	""Oh| thou ~ whomsoever thou mayst be, into whose hands	205:160,23B  !
1B	these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall"" ~ when	205:160,24B  !
1B	your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you	205:160,25B  !
1B	in total darkness."	205:160,26B  !
1A	"Oh| no, no ~ do not say so. Well, go on."	205:160,27A  !
1A	"This is strange indeed| I did not expect such a sight	206:163,21A  !
1A	as this|~ An immense heavy chest|~ What can it hold?~	206:163,22A  !
1A	Why should it be placed here?~ Pushed back too, as if	206:163,23A  !
1A	meant to be out of sight|~ I will look into it ~ cost me	206:163,24A  !
1A	what it may, I will look into it ~ and directly too ~ by	206:163,25A  !
1A	day-light.~ If I stay till evening my candle may go out."	206:163,26A  !
1C	"That is a curious old chest, is not it?"	206:165, 6C  !
1C	"It is impossible to say how many generations	206:165, 8C  !
1C	it has been here. How it came to be first put in this room	206:165, 9C  !
1C	I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought	206:165,10C  !
1C	it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets.	206:165,11C  !
1C	The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to	206:165,12C  !
1C	open. In that corner, however, it is at least out of the	206:165,13C  !
1C	way."	206:165,14C  !
1A	"No, indeed,"	206:166,12A  !
1A	"Mr% Allen's	206:166,12A  !
1A	dining-parlour was not more than half as large:"	206:166,13A  !
1A	"How much better is this,"	206:167,14A  !
1A	"how much better	206:167,15A  !
1A	to find a fire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in	206:167,16A  !
1A	the cold till all the family are in bed, as so many poor	206:167,17A  !
1A	girls have been obliged to do, and then to have a faithful	206:167,18A  !
1A	old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot|	206:167,19A  !
1A	How glad I am that Northanger is what it is| If it had	206:167,20A  !
1A	been like some other places, I do not know that, in such	206:167,21A  !
1A	a night as this, I could have answered for my courage:~	206:167,22A  !
1A	but now, to be sure, there is nothing to alarm one."	206:167,23A  !
1A	"But we have a charming morning after it,"	207:174, 9A  !
1A	"and storms and	207:174,10A  !
1A	sleeplessness are nothing when they are over. What	207:174,11A  !
1A	beautiful hyacinths|~ I have just learnt to love a hyacinth."	207:174,12A  !
1B	"And how might you learn?~ By accident or argument?"	207:174,14B  !
1A	"Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how. Mrs% Allen	207:174,16A  !
1A	used to take pains, year after year, to make me like	207:174,17A  !
1A	them; but I never could, till I saw them the other day	207:174,18A  !
1A	in Milsom-street; I am naturally indifferent about	207:174,19A  !
1A	flowers."	207:174,20A  !
1B	"But now you love a hyacinth. So much the better.	207:174,21B  !
1B	You have gained a new source of enjoyment, and it is	207:174,22B  !
1B	well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible.	207:174,23B  !
1B	Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex,	207:174,24B  !
1B	as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you	207:174,25B  !
1B	to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise	207:174,26B  !
1B	take. And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather	207:174,27B  !
1B	domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once raised, but you	207:174,28B  !
1B	may in time come to love a rose?"	207:174,29B  !
1A	"But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of	207:174,30A  !
1A	doors. The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air	207:174,31A  !
1A	is enough for me, and in fine weather I am out more than	207:174,32A  !
1A	half my time.~ Mamma says, I am never within."	207:174,33A  !
1B	"At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have	207:174,34B  !
1B	learnt to love a hyacinth. The mere habit of learning to	207:174,35B  !
1B	love is the thing; and a teachableness of disposition in	207:174,36B  !
1B	a young lady is a great blessing.~ Has my sister a pleasant	207:174,37B  !
1B	mode of instruction?"	207:174,38B  !
1A	"Is it a pretty place?"	207:175,32A  !
1C	"I believe it will be wisest to take the	207:177,13C  !
1C	morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on my	207:177,14C  !
1C	father's account, he always walks out at this time of day."	207:177,15C  !
1A	"No, not at all. Mr% Allen did not care about the	207:178,28A  !
1A	garden, and never went into it."	207:178,29A  !
1A	"Mr% Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs% Allen	207:178,36A  !
1A	had the use of for her plants in winter, and there	207:178,37A  !
1A	was a fire in it now and then."	207:178,38A  !
1C	"This is so favourite a walk of mine,"	207:179,13C  !
1C	"that I always think it the best and nearest way. But	207:179,14C  !
1C	perhaps it may be damp."	207:179,15C  !
1C	"I am particularly fond of this spot,"	207:179,30C  !
1C	"It was my mother's favourite	207:179,31C  !
1C	walk."	207:179,32C  !
1C	"I used to walk here so often with her|"	207:179,38C  !
1C	"though I never loved it then, as I have loved it since.	207:180, 1C  !
1C	At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice.	207:180, 2C  !
1C	But her memory endears it now."	207:180, 3C  !
1A	"Her	207:180, 6A  !
1A	death must have been a great affliction|"	207:180, 7A  !
1C	"A great and increasing one,"	207:180, 8C  !
1C	"I was only thirteen when it happened;	207:180, 9C  !
1C	and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so	207:180,10C  !
1C	young could feel it, I did not, I could not then know what	207:180,11C  !
1C	a loss it was."	207:180,12C  !
1C	"I have no sister, you know	207:180,13C  !
1C	~ and though Henry ~ though my brothers are very	207:180,14C  !
1C	affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I am	207:180,15C  !
1C	most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often	207:180,16C  !
1C	solitary."	207:180,17C  !
1A	"To be sure you must miss him very much."	207:180,18A  !
1C	"A mother would have been always present. A mother	207:180,19C  !
1C	would have been a constant friend; her influence would	207:180,20C  !
1C	have been beyond all other."	207:180,21C  !
1A	"Was she a very charming woman? Was she handsome?	207:180,22A  !
1A	Was there any picture of her in the Abbey?	207:180,23A  !
1A	And why had she been so partial to that grove? Was it	207:180,24A  !
1A	from dejection of spirits?"	207:180,25A  !
1A	"Her picture, I suppose,"	207:180,35A  !
1A	"hangs in your father's room?"	207:180,36A  !
1C	"No;~ it was intended for the drawing-room; but my	207:180,37C  !
1C	father was dissatisfied with the painting, and for some	207:180,38C  !
1C	time it had no place. Soon after her death I obtained it	207:181, 1C  !
1C	for my own, and hung it in my bed-chamber ~ where	207:181, 2C  !
1C	I shall be happy to shew it you;~ it is very like." ~	207:181, 3C  !
1C	"I was going to take you into what was	208:186, 9C  !
1C	my mother's room ~ the room in which she died ~~"	208:186,10C  !
1A	"It remains as it was, I suppose?"	208:186,24A  !
1C	"Yes, entirely."	208:186,26C  !
1A	"And how long ago may it be that your mother died?"	208:186,27A  !
1C	"She has been dead these nine years."	208:186,28C  !
1A	"You were with her, I suppose, to the last?"	208:186,32A  !
1C	"No,"	208:186,33C  !
1C	"I was unfortunately	208:186,33C  !
1C	from home.~ Her illness was sudden and short; and	208:186,34C  !
1C	before I arrived it was all over."	208:186,35C  !
1C	"My father,"	208:187,12C  !
1C	"often	208:187,12C  !
1C	walks about the room in this way; it is nothing unusual."	208:187,13C  !
1A	"So much the worse|"	208:187,14A  !
1C	"My father only wanted me to answer	209:192,24C  !
1C	a note,"	209:192,25C  !
1A	"Mr% Tilney|"	209:194,25A  !
1A	"Good God|"	209:194,27A  !
1A	"how came you	209:194,28A  !
1A	here?~ how came you up that staircase?"	209:194,29A  !
1B	"How came I up that staircase|"	209:194,30B  !
1B	"Because it is my nearest way from the	209:194,31B  !
1B	stable-yard to my own chamber; and why should I not	209:194,32B  !
1B	come up it?"	209:194,33B  !
1B	"And may	209:194,37B  !
1B	I not, in my turn,"	209:194,38B  !
1B	"ask how \you\ came here?~ This passage is at	209:195, 1B  !
1B	least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast-parlour	209:195, 2B  !
1B	to your apartment, as that staircase can be from the	209:195, 3B  !
1B	stables to mine."	209:195, 4B  !
1A	"I have been,"	209:195, 5A  !
1A	"to see	209:195, 5A  !
1A	your mother's room."	209:195, 6A  !
1B	"My mother's room|~ Is there any thing extraordinary	209:195, 7B  !
1B	to be seen there?"	209:195, 8B  !
1A	"No, nothing at all.~ I thought you did not mean to	209:195, 9A  !
1A	come back till to-morrow."	209:195,10A  !
1B	"I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when	209:195,11B  !
1B	I went away; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of	209:195,12B  !
1B	finding nothing to detain me.~ You look pale.~ I am	209:195,13B  !
1B	afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs.	209:195,14B  !
1B	Perhaps you did not know ~ you were not aware of their	209:195,15B  !
1B	leading from the offices in common use?"	209:195,16B  !
1A	"No, I was not.~ You have had a very fine day for	209:195,17A  !
1A	your ride."	209:195,18A  !
1B	"Very;~ and does Eleanor leave you to find your way	209:195,19B  !
1B	into all the rooms in the house by yourself?"	209:195,20B  !
1A	"Oh| no; she shewed me over the greatest part on	209:195,21A  !
1A	Saturday ~ and we were coming here to these rooms ~	209:195,22A  !
1A	but only ~	209:195,23A  !
1A	your father was with us."	209:195,23A  !
1B	"And that prevented you;"	209:195,24B  !
1B	"Have you looked into all the rooms in	209:195,25B  !
1B	that passage?"	209:195,26B  !
1A	"No, I only wanted to see ~~ Is not it very late?	209:195,27A  !
1A	I must go and dress."	209:195,28A  !
1B	"It is only a quarter past four,	209:195,29B  !
1B	and	209:195,29B  !
1B	you are not now in Bath. No theatre, no rooms to	209:195,30B  !
1B	prepare for. Half an hour at Northanger must be enough."	209:195,31B  !
1B	"Have	209:195,35B  !
1B	you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?"	209:195,36B  !
1A	"No, and I am very much surprized. Isabella promised	209:195,37A  !
1A	so faithfully to write directly."	209:195,38A  !
1B	"Promised so faithfully|~ A faithful promise|~ That	209:196, 1B  !
1B	puzzles me.~ I have heard of a faithful performance.	209:196, 2B  !
1B	But a faithful promise ~ the fidelity of promising| It is	209:196, 3B  !
1B	a power little worth knowing however, since it can deceive	209:196, 4B  !
1B	and pain you. My mother's room is very commodious,	209:196, 5B  !
1B	is it not? Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing closets	209:196, 6B  !
1B	so well disposed| It always strikes me as the most	209:196, 7B  !
1B	comfortable apartment in the house, and I rather wonder	209:196, 8B  !
1B	that Eleanor should not take it for her own. She sent you	209:196, 9B  !
1B	to look at it, I suppose?"	209:196,10B  !
1A	"No."	209:196,11A  !
1B	"It has been your own doing entirely?"~	209:196,12B  !
1B	"As there is nothing in	209:196,14B  !
1B	the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must have proceeded	209:196,15B  !
1B	from a sentiment of respect for my mother's	209:196,16B  !
1B	character, as described by Eleanor, which does honour	209:196,17B  !
1B	to her memory. The world, I believe, never saw a better	209:196,18B  !
1B	woman. But it is not often that virtue can boast an	209:196,19B  !
1B	interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits	209:196,20B  !
1B	of a person never known, do not often create that kind	209:196,21B  !
1B	of fervent, venerating tenderness which would prompt	209:196,22B  !
1B	a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose, has talked of her	209:196,23B  !
1B	a great deal?"	209:196,24B  !
1A	"Yes, a great deal. That is ~ no, not much, but what	209:196,25A  !
1A	she did say, was very interesting. Her dying so suddenly,"	209:196,26A  !
1A	"and you ~	209:196,27A  !
1A	none of you being at home ~ and your father, I thought ~	209:196,28A  !
1A	perhaps had not been very fond of her."	209:196,29A  !
1B	"And from these circumstances,"	209:196,30B  !
1B	"you infer perhaps the probability of	209:196,31B  !
1B	some negligence ~ some ~	209:196,32B  !
1B	or it may be ~ of something still less pardonable."	209:196,33B  !
1B	"My mother's illness,"	209:196,35B  !
1B	"the seizure which ended in her death \was\ sudden. The	209:196,36B  !
1B	malady itself, one from which she had often suffered,	209:196,37B  !
1B	a bilious fever ~ its cause therefore constitutional. On the	209:196,38B  !
1B	third day, in short as soon as she could be prevailed on,	209:197, 1B  !
1B	a physician attended her, a very respectable man, and one	209:197, 2B  !
1B	in whom she had always placed great confidence. Upon	209:197, 3B  !
1B	his opinion of her danger, two others were called in the	209:197, 4B  !
1B	next day, and remained in almost constant attendance	209:197, 5B  !
1B	for four-and-twenty hours. On the fifth day she died.	209:197, 6B  !
1B	During the progress of her disorder, Frederick and I (\we\	209:197, 7B  !
1B	were both at home) saw her repeatedly; and from our	209:197, 8B  !
1B	own observation can bear witness to her having received	209:197, 9B  !
1B	every possible attention which could spring from the	209:197,10B  !
1B	affection of those about her, or which her situation in	209:197,11B  !
1B	life could command. Poor Eleanor \was\ absent, and at	209:197,12B  !
1B	such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her	209:197,13B  !
1B	coffin."	209:197,14B  !
1A	"But your father,"	209:197,15A  !
1A	"was \he\ afflicted?"	209:197,15A  !
1B	"For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing	209:197,16B  !
1B	him not attached to her. He loved her, I am persuaded,	209:197,17B  !
1B	as well as it was possible for him to ~ We have not all,	209:197,18B  !
1B	you know, the same tenderness of disposition ~ and I will	209:197,19B  !
1B	not pretend to say that while she lived, she might not	209:197,20B  !
1B	often have had much to bear, but though his temper	209:197,21B  !
1B	injured her, his judgment never did. His value of her	209:197,22B  !
1B	was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was truly	209:197,23B  !
1B	afflicted by her death."	209:197,24B  !
1A	"I am very glad of it,"	209:197,25A  !
1A	"it would have	209:197,25A  !

1B	of such horror as I have hardly words to ~~ Dear Miss Morland,	209:197,28B  !
1B	consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions	209:197,29B  !

1B	passing around you ~ Does our education prepare us for	209:197,35B  !
1B	such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could	209:197,36B  !
1B	they be perpetrated without being known, in a country	209:197,37B  !

1B	a footing; where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood	209:198, 1B  !
1B	of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers	209:198, 2B  !
1B	lay every thing open? Dearest Miss Morland,	209:198, 3B  !
1B	what ideas have you been admitting?"	209:198, 4B  !
1A	"'Tis only from James,	210:202, 1A  !

1C	"No bad news from Fullerton, I hope?	210:203,34C  !
1C	Mr% and Mrs% Morland ~ your brothers and sisters ~ I hope	210:203,35C  !
1C	they are none of them ill?"	210:203,36C  !
1A	"No, I thank you,"	210:203,37A  !
1A	"they are	210:203,37A  !
1A	all very well. My letter was from my brother at Oxford."	210:203,38A  !
1A	"I do not think	210:204, 2A  !
1A	I shall ever wish for a letter again|"	210:204, 3A  !
1B	"I am sorry,"	210:204, 4B  !
1B	"if I had suspected the letter of containing	210:204, 5B  !
1B	any thing unwelcome, I should have given it with very	210:204, 6B  !
1B	different feelings."	210:204, 7B  !
1A	"It contained something worse than any body could	210:204, 8A  !
1A	suppose|~ Poor James is so unhappy|~ You will soon	210:204, 9A  !
1A	know why."	210:204,10A  !
1B	"To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,"	210:204,11B  !
1B	"must be a comfort to him under	210:204,12B  !
1B	any distress."	210:204,13B  !
1A	"I have one favour to beg,"	210:204,14A  !
1A	"that, if your brother	210:204,15A  !
1A	should be coming here, you will give me notice of it, that	210:204,16A  !
1A	I may go away."	210:204,17A  !
1B	"Our brother|~ Frederick|"	210:204,18B  !
1A	"Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you	210:204,19A  !
1A	so soon, but something has happened that would make it	210:204,20A  !
1A	very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney."	210:204,21A  !
1A	"How quick you are|"	210:204,27A  !
1A	"you have	210:204,27A  !
1A	guessed it, I declare|~ And yet, when we talked about	210:204,28A  !
1A	it in Bath, you little thought of its ending so. Isabella ~	210:204,29A  !
1A	no wonder \now\ I have not heard from her ~ Isabella has	210:204,30A  !
1A	deserted my brother, and is to marry your's| Could you	210:204,31A  !
1A	have believed there had been such inconstancy and	210:204,32A  !
1A	fickleness, and every thing that is bad in the world?"	210:204,33A  !
1B	"I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed.	210:204,34B  !
1B	I hope he has not had any material share in	210:204,35B  !
1B	bringing on Mr% Morland's disappointment. His marrying	210:204,36B  !
1B	Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think you must be	210:204,37B  !
1B	deceived so far. I am very sorry for Mr% Morland ~	210:204,38B  !
1B	sorry that any one you love should be unhappy; but my	210:205, 1B  !
1B	surprize would be greater at Frederick's marrying her,	210:205, 2B  !
1B	than at any other part of the story."	210:205, 3B  !
1A	"It is very true, however; you shall read James's	210:205, 4A  !
1A	letter yourself.~ Stay ~~ there is one part ~~"	210:205, 5A  !
1B	"Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages	210:205, 7B  !
1B	which concern my brother?"	210:205, 8B  !
1A	"No, read it yourself,"	210:205, 9A  !
1A	"I do not know what I was	210:205,10A  !
1A	thinking of,"	210:205,11A  !
1A	~ "James only means to give me good advice."	210:205,12A  !
1B	"Well,	210:205,14B  !
1B	if it is to be so, I can only say that I am sorry for it.	210:205,15B  !
1B	Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife	210:205,16B  !
1B	with less sense than his family expected. I do not envy	210:205,17B  !
1B	his situation, either as a lover or a son."	210:205,18B  !
1A	"Her mother is a very good sort of woman,"	210:205,23A  !
1C	"What was her father?"	210:205,25C  !
1A	"A lawyer, I believe.~ They live at Putney."	210:205,26A  !
1C	"Are they a wealthy family?"	210:205,27C  !
1A	"No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any	210:205,28A  !
1A	fortune at all: but that will not signify in your family.~	210:205,29A  !
1A	Your father is so very liberal| He told me the other	210:205,30A  !
1A	day, that he only valued money as it allowed him to	210:205,31A  !
1A	promote the happiness of his children."	210:205,32A  !
1C	"But,"	210:205,33C  !
1C	"would it be to promote his happiness,	210:205,34C  !
1C	to enable him to marry such a girl?~ She must be an	210:205,35C  !
1C	unprincipled one, or she could not have used your brother	210:205,36C  !
1C	so.~ And how strange an infatuation on Frederick's	210:205,37C  !
1C	side| A girl who, before his eyes, is violating an engagement	210:205,38C  !
1C	voluntarily entered into with another man| Is	210:206, 1C  !
1C	not it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always	210:206, 2C  !
1C	wore his heart so proudly| who found no woman good	210:206, 3C  !
1C	enough to be loved|"	210:206, 4C  !
1B	"That is the most unpromising circumstance, the	210:206, 5B  !
1B	strongest presumption against him. When I think of his	210:206, 6B  !
1B	past declarations, I give him up.~ Moreover, I have too	210:206, 7B  !
1B	good an opinion of Miss Thorpe's prudence, to suppose	210:206, 8B  !
1B	that she would part with one gentleman before the other	210:206, 9B  !
1B	was secured. It is all over with Frederick indeed| He	210:206,10B  !
1B	is a deceased man ~ defunct in understanding. Prepare	210:206,11B  !
1B	for your sister-in-law, Eleanor, and such a sister-in-law	210:206,12B  !
1B	as you must delight in|~ Open, candid, artless, guileless,	210:206,13B  !
1B	with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions,	210:206,14B  !
1B	and knowing no disguise."	210:206,15B  !
1C	"Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,"	210:206,16C  !
1A	"But perhaps,"	210:206,18A  !
1A	"though she has	210:206,18A  !
1A	behaved so ill by our family, she may behave better by	210:206,19A  !
1A	your's. Now she has really got the man she likes, she	210:206,20A  !
1A	may be constant."	210:206,21A  !
1B	"Indeed I am afraid she will,"	210:206,22B  !
1B	"I am	210:206,22B  !
1B	afraid she will be very constant, unless a baronet should	210:206,23B  !
1B	come in her way; that is Frederick's only chance.~ I will	210:206,24B  !
1B	get the Bath paper, and look over the arrivals."	210:206,25B  !
1A	"You think it is all for ambition then?~ And, upon	210:206,26A  !
1A	my word, there are some things that seem very like it.	210:206,27A  !
1A	I cannot forget, that, when she first knew what my	210:206,28A  !
1A	father would do for them, she seemed quite disappointed	210:206,29A  !
1A	that it was not more. I never was so deceived in any one's	210:206,30A  !
1A	character in my life before."	210:206,31A  !
1B	"Among all the great variety that you have known	210:206,32B  !
1B	and studied."	210:206,33B  !
1A	"My own disappointment and loss in her is very great;	210:206,34A  !
1A	but, as for poor James, I suppose he will hardly ever	210:206,35A  !
1A	recover it."	210:206,36A  !
1B	"Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at	210:206,37B  !
1B	present; but we must not, in our concern for his sufferings,	210:206,38B  !
1B	undervalue your's. You feel, I suppose, that, in	210:207, 1B  !
1B	losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel a void in	210:207, 2B  !
1B	your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is	210:207, 3B  !
1B	becoming irksome; and as for the amusements in which	210:207, 4B  !
1B	you were wont to share at Bath, the very idea of them	210:207, 5B  !
1B	without her is abhorrent. You would not, for instance,	210:207, 6B  !
1B	now go to a ball for the world. You feel that you have	210:207, 7B  !
1B	no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve;	210:207, 8B  !
1B	on whose regard you can place dependence; or whose	210:207, 9B  !
1B	counsel, in any difficulty, you could rely on. You feel	210:207,10B  !
1B	all this?"	210:207,11B  !
1A	"No,"	210:207,12A  !
1A	"I do not ~ ought I? To say the truth, though I am	210:207,13A  !
1A	hurt and grieved, that I cannot still love her, that I am	210:207,14A  !
1A	never to hear from her, perhaps never to see her again,	210:207,15A  !
1A	I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would	210:207,16A  !
1A	have thought."	210:207,17A  !
1B	"You feel, as you always do, what is most to the	210:207,18B  !
1B	credit of human nature.~ Such feelings ought to be	210:207,19B  !
1B	investigated, that they may know themselves."	210:207,20B  !
1B	"No,"	211:209, 6B  !
1B	"my	211:209, 6B  !
1B	father's hands need not be strengthened, and Frederick's	211:209, 7B  !
1B	confession of folly need not be forestalled. He must tell	211:209, 8B  !
1B	his own story."	211:209, 9B  !
1A	"But he will tell only half of it."	211:209,10A  !
1B	"A quarter would be enough."	211:209,11B  !
1B	"And when do you think, sir, I may look	211:209,35B  !
1B	forward to this pleasure?~ I must be at Woodston on	211:209,36B  !
1B	Monday to attend the parish meeting, and shall probably	211:209,37B  !
1B	be obliged to stay two or three days."	211:209,38B  !
1B	"I am	211:210,30B  !
1B	come, young ladies, in a very moralizing strain, to observe	211:210,31B  !
1B	that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for,	211:210,32B  !
1B	and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage,	211:210,33B  !
1B	giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the	211:210,34B  !
1B	future, that may not be honoured. Witness myself,	211:210,35B  !
1B	at this present hour. Because I am to hope for	211:210,36B  !
1B	the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston in Wednesday,	211:210,37B  !
1B	which bad weather, or twenty other causes may	211:210,38B  !
1B	prevent, I must go away directly, two days before	211:211, 1B  !
1B	I intended it."	211:211, 2B  !
1A	"Go away|"	211:211, 3A  !
1A	"and why?"	211:211, 4A  !
1B	"Why|~ How can you ask the question?~ Because	211:211, 5B  !
1B	no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper	211:211, 6B  !
1B	out of her wits,~ because I must go and prepare a dinner	211:211, 7B  !
1B	for you to be sure."	211:211, 8B  !
1A	"Oh| not seriously|"	211:211, 9A  !
1B	"Aye, and sadly too ~ for I had much rather stay."	211:211,10B  !
1A	"But how can you think of such a thing, after what	211:211,11A  !
1A	the General said? when he so particularly desired you not	211:211,12A  !
1A	to give yourself any trouble, because \any thing\ would do."	211:211,13A  !
1A	"I am sure it is quite unnecessary	211:211,14A  !
1A	upon your sister's account and mine. You must know	211:211,15A  !
1A	it to be so; and the General made such a point of your	211:211,16A  !
1A	providing nothing extraordinary:~ besides, if he had not	211:211,17A  !
1A	said half so much as he did, he has always such an excellent	211:211,18A  !
1A	dinner at home, that sitting down to a middling one for	211:211,19A  !
1A	one day could not signify."	211:211,20A  !
1B	"I wish I could reason like you, for his sake and my	211:211,21B  !
1B	own. Good bye. As to-morrow is Sunday, Eleanor,	211:211,22B  !
1B	I shall not return."	211:211,23B  !
1A	"Oh| why do not you fit up this room, Mr% Tilney?	211:214, 1A  !
1A	What a pity not to have it fitted up| It is	211:214, 2A  !
1A	the prettiest room I ever saw;~ it is the prettiest room	211:214, 3A  !
1A	in the world|"	211:214, 4A  !
1A	"Well, if it was my house, I should never sit any where	211:214, 8A  !
1A	else. Oh| what a sweet little cottage there is among the	211:214, 9A  !
1A	trees ~ apple trees too| It is the prettiest cottage|"~	211:214,10A  !
1D	\Bath, April @@@@\	212:216, 3D  !
1D	My dearest Catherine,	212:216, 4D  !
1D	I received your two kind letters with the greatest	212:216, 5D  !
1D	delight, and have a thousand apologies to make for not	212:216, 6D  !
1D	answering them sooner. I really am quite ashamed of	212:216, 7D  !
1D	my idleness; but in this horrid place one can find time	212:216, 8D  !
1D	for nothing. I have had my pen in my hand to begin	212:216, 9D  !
1D	a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but	212:216,10D  !
1D	have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other.	212:216,11D  !
1D	Pray write to me soon, and direct to my own home.	212:216,12D  !
1D	Thank God| we leave this vile place to-morrow. Since	212:216,13D  !
1D	you went away, I have had no pleasure in it ~ the dust is	212:216,14D  !
1D	beyond any thing; and every body one cares for is gone.	212:216,15D  !
1D	I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest,	212:216,16D  !
1D	for you are dearer to me than any body can conceive.	212:216,17D  !
1D	I am quite uneasy about your dear brother, not having	212:216,18D  !
1D	heard from him since he went to Oxford; and am fearful	212:216,19D  !
1D	of some misunderstanding. Your kind offices will set all	212:216,20D  !
1D	right:~ he is the only man I ever did or could love, and	212:216,21D  !
1D	I trust you will convince him of it. The spring fashions	212:216,22D  !
1D	are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you can	212:216,23D  !
1D	imagine. I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am	212:216,24D  !
1D	afraid you never think of me. I will not say all that	212:216,25D  !
1D	I could of the family you are with, because I would not	212:216,26D  !
1D	be ungenerous, or set you against those you esteem;	212:216,27D  !
1D	but it is very difficult to know whom to trust, and young	212:216,28D  !
1D	men never know their minds two days together. I rejoice	212:216,29D  !
1D	to say, that the young man whom, of all others, I particularly	212:216,30D  !
1D	abhor, has left Bath. You will know, from this	212:216,31D  !
1D	description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, as you	212:216,32D  !
1D	may remember, was amazingly disposed to follow and	212:217, 1D  !
1D	tease me, before you went away. Afterwards he got	212:217, 2D  !
1D	worse, and became quite my shadow. Many girls might	212:217, 3D  !
1D	have been taken in, for never were such attentions; but	212:217, 4D  !
1D	I knew the fickle sex too well. He went away to his	212:217, 5D  !
1D	regiment two days ago, and I trust I shall never be	212:217, 6D  !
1D	plagued with him again. He is the greatest coxcomb I	212:217, 7D  !
1D	ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The last two	212:217, 8D  !
1D	days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis:	212:217, 9D  !
1D	I pitied his taste, but took no notice of him. The last	212:217,10D  !
1D	time we met was in Bath-street, and I turned directly	212:217,11D  !
1D	into a shop that he might not speak to me;~ I would	212:217,12D  !
1D	not even look at him. He went into the Pump-room	212:217,13D  !
1D	afterwards; but I would not have followed him for all	212:217,14D  !
1D	the world. Such a contrast between him and your	212:217,15D  !
1D	brother|~ pray send me some news of the latter ~ I am	212:217,16D  !
1D	quite unhappy about him, he seemed so uncomfortable	212:217,17D  !
1D	when he went away, with a cold, or something that	212:217,18D  !
1D	affected his spirits. I would write to him myself, but	212:217,19D  !
1D	have mislaid his direction; and, as I hinted above, am	212:217,20D  !
1D	afraid he took something in my conduct amiss. Pray	212:217,21D  !
1D	explain every thing to his satisfaction; or, if he still	212:217,22D  !
1D	harbours any doubt, a line from himself to me, or a call	212:217,23D  !
1D	at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights.	212:217,24D  !
1D	I have not been to the Rooms this age, nor to the Play,	212:217,25D  !
1D	except going in last night with the Hodges's, for a frolic,	212:217,26D  !
1D	at half-price: they teased me into it; and I was determined	212:217,27D  !
1D	they should not say I shut myself up because	212:217,28D  !
1D	Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by the Mitchells,	212:217,29D  !
1D	and they pretended to be quite surprized to see me out.	212:217,30D  !
1D	I knew their spite:~ at one time they could not be civil	212:217,31D  !
1D	to me, but now they are all friendship; but I am not	212:217,32D  !
1D	such a fool as to be taken in by them. You know I have	212:217,33D  !
1D	a pretty good spirit of my own. Anne Mitchell had tried	212:217,34D  !
1D	to put on a turban like mine, as I wore it the week before	212:217,35D  !
1D	at the Concert, but made wretched work of it ~ it happened	212:217,36D  !
1D	to become my odd face I believe, at least Tilney told me	212:217,37D  !
1D	so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; but he	212:217,38D  !
1D	is the last man whose word I would take. I wear nothing	212:218, 1D  !
1D	but purple now: I know I look hideous in it, but no	212:218, 2D  !
1D	matter ~ it is your dear brother's favourite colour. Lose	212:218, 3D  !
1D	no time, my dearest, sweetest Catherine, in writing to	212:218, 4D  !
1D	him and to me,	212:218, 5D  !
1D	Who ever am,	212:218, 6D  !
1A	"So much for Isabella,"	212:218,20A  !
1A	"and for all our intimacy| She must think me	212:218,21A  !
1A	an idiot, or she could not have written so; but perhaps	212:218,22A  !
1A	this has served to make her character better known to	212:218,23A  !
1A	me than mine is to her. I see what she has been about.	212:218,24A  !
1A	She is a vain coquette, and her tricks have not answered.	212:218,25A  !
1A	I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James	212:218,26A  !
1A	or for me, and I wish I had never known her."	212:218,27A  !
1B	"It will soon be as if you never had,"	212:218,28B  !
1A	"There is but one thing that I cannot understand.	212:218,29A  !
1A	I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney, which	212:218,30A  !
1A	have not succeeded; but I do not understand what	212:218,31A  !
1A	Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should	212:218,32A  !
1A	he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with	212:218,33A  !
1A	my brother, and then fly off himself?"	212:218,34A  !
1B	"I have very little to say for Frederick's motives, such	212:218,35B  !
1B	as I believe them to have been. He has his vanities as	212:218,36B  !
1B	well as Miss Thorpe, and the chief difference is, that,	212:218,37B  !
1B	having a stronger head, they have not yet injured himself.	212:219, 1B  !
1B	If the \effect\ of his behaviour does not justify him with you,	212:219, 2B  !
1B	we had better not seek after the cause."	212:219, 3B  !
1A	"Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about	212:219, 4A  !
1A	her?"	212:219, 5A  !
1B	"I am persuaded that he never did."	212:219, 6B  !
1A	"And only made believe to do so for mischief's sake?"	212:219, 7A  !
1A	"Well, then, I must say that I do not like him at all.	212:219, 9A  !
1A	Though it has turned out so well for us, I do not like him	212:219,10A  !
1A	at all. As it happens, there is no great harm done,	212:219,11A  !
1A	because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose.	212:219,12A  !
1A	But, suppose he had made her very much in love with	212:219,13A  !
1A	him?"	212:219,14A  !
1B	"But we must first suppose Isabella to have had	212:219,15B  !
1B	a heart to lose,~ consequently to have been a very	212:219,16B  !
1B	different creature; and, in that case, she would have	212:219,17B  !
1B	met with very different treatment."	212:219,18B  !
1A	"It is very right that you should stand by your	212:219,19A  !
1A	brother."	212:219,20A  !
1B	"And if you would stand by \your's\, you would not be	212:219,21B  !
1B	much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe.	212:219,22B  !
1B	But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general	212:219,23B  !
1B	integrity, and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings	212:219,24B  !
1B	of family partiality, or a desire of revenge."	212:219,25B  !
1C	"Nay, if you can use such a word, I can urge you no	213:221,16C  !
1C	farther. If you think it long ~"	213:221,17C  !
1A	"Oh| no, I do not indeed. For my own pleasure,	213:221,18A  !
1A	I could stay with you as long again."	213:221,19A  !
1C	"Good Heaven| what can be the	213:222,12C  !
1C	matter?"	213:222,13C  !
1C	"My dear Catherine,	213:223,15C  !
1C	you must not ~ you must not indeed~"	213:223,16C  !
1C	"I am quite well. This kindness	213:223,17C  !
1C	distracts me ~ I cannot bear it ~ I come to you on such an	213:223,18C  !
1C	errand|"	213:223,19C  !
1A	"Errand|~ to me|"	213:223,20A  !
1C	"How shall I tell you|~ Oh| how shall I tell you|"	213:223,21C  !
1A	"'Tis a messenger	213:223,23A  !
1A	from Woodston|"	213:223,24A  !
1C	"You are mistaken, indeed,"	213:223,25C  !
1C	"it is no one from Woodston.	213:223,26C  !
1C	It is my father himself."	213:223,27C  !
1C	"You are too good, I am sure,	213:223,34C  !
1C	to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to	213:223,35C  !
1C	perform. I am indeed a most unwilling messenger.	213:223,36C  !
1C	After what has so lately passed, so lately been settled	213:223,37C  !
1C	between us ~ how joyfully, how thankfully on my side|~	213:223,38C  !
1C	as to your continuing here as I hoped for many, many	213:224, 1C  !
1C	weeks longer, how can I tell you that your kindness is not	213:224, 2C  !
1C	to be accepted ~ and that the happiness your company	213:224, 3C  !
1C	has hitherto given us is to be repaid by ~~ but I must	213:224, 4C  !
1C	not trust myself with words. My dear Catherine, we are	213:224, 5C  !
1C	to part. My father has recollected an engagement that	213:224, 6C  !
1C	takes our whole family away on Monday. We are going	213:224, 7C  !
1C	to Lord Longtown's, near Hereford, for a fortnight.	213:224, 8C  !
1C	Explanation and apology are equally impossible. I cannot	213:224, 9C  !
1C	attempt either."	213:224,10C  !
1A	"My dear Eleanor,"	213:224,11A  !
1A	"do not be so distressed.	213:224,12A  !
1A	A second engagement must give way to a first. I am	213:224,13A  !
1A	very, very sorry we are to part ~ so soon, and so suddenly	213:224,14A  !
1A	too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not. I can	213:224,15A  !
1A	finish my visit here you know at any time; or I hope you	213:224,16A  !
1A	will come to me. Can you, when you return from this	213:224,17A  !
1A	lord's, come to Fullerton?"	213:224,18A  !
1C	"It will not be in my power, Catherine."	213:224,19C  !
1C	"Come when you can, then."~	213:224,20C  !
1A	"Monday ~ so soon as Monday;~	213:224,23A  !
1A	and you \all\ go. Well, I am certain of ~ I shall be able	213:224,24A  !
1A	to take leave however. I need not go till just before you	213:224,25A  !
1A	do, you know. Do not be distressed, Eleanor, I can go	213:224,26A  !
1A	on Monday very well. My father and mother's having	213:224,27A  !
1A	no notice of it is of very little consequence. The General	213:224,28A  !
1A	will send a servant with me, I dare say, half the way ~	213:224,29A  !
1A	and then I shall soon be at Salisbury, and then I am only	213:224,30A  !
1A	nine miles from home."	213:224,31A  !
1C	"Ah, Catherine| were it settled so, it would be somewhat	213:224,32C  !
1C	less intolerable, though in such common attentions	213:224,33C  !
1C	you would have received but half what you ought.	213:224,34C  !
1C	But ~ how can I tell you?~ To-morrow morning is fixed	213:224,35C  !
1C	for your leaving us, and not even the hour is left to your	213:224,36C  !
1C	choice; the very carriage is ordered, and will be here at	213:224,37C  !
1C	seven o'clock, and no servant will be offered you."	213:224,38C  !
1C	"I	213:225, 1C  !
1C	could hardly believe my senses, when I heard it;~ and	213:225, 2C  !
1C	no displeasure, no resentment that you can feel at this	213:225, 3C  !
1C	moment, however justly great, can be more than I myself ~~	213:225, 4C  !
1C	but I must not talk of what I felt. Oh| that	213:225, 5C  !
1C	I could suggest any thing in extenuation| Good God|	213:225, 6C  !
1C	what will your father and mother say| After courting	213:225, 7C  !
1C	you from the protection of real friends to this ~ almost	213:225, 8C  !
1C	double distance from your home, to have you driven out	213:225, 9C  !
1C	of the house, without the considerations even of decent	213:225,10C  !
1C	civility| Dear, dear Catherine, in being the bearer of	213:225,11C  !
1C	such a message, I seem guilty myself of all its insult;	213:225,12C  !
1C	yet, I trust you will acquit me, for you must have been	213:225,13C  !
1C	long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal	213:225,14C  !
1C	mistress of it, that my real power is nothing."	213:225,15C  !
1A	"Have I offended the General?"	213:225,16A  !
1C	"Alas| for my feelings as a daughter, all that I know,	213:225,18C  !
1C	all that I answer for is, that you can have given him no	213:225,19C  !
1C	just cause of offence. He certainly is greatly, very	213:225,20C  !
1C	greatly discomposed; I have seldom seen him more so.	213:225,21C  !
1C	His temper is not happy, and something has now occurred	213:225,22C  !
1C	to ruffle it in an uncommon degree; some disappointment,	213:225,23C  !
1C	some vexation, which just at this moment seems important;	213:225,24C  !
1C	but which I can hardly suppose you to have any	213:225,25C  !
1C	concern in, for how is it possible?"	213:225,26C  !
1A	"I am sure,"	213:225,29A  !
1A	"I am very sorry if I have offended	213:225,29A  !
1A	him. It was the last thing I would willingly have done.	213:225,30A  !
1A	But do not be unhappy, Eleanor. An engagement you	213:225,31A  !
1A	know must be kept. I am only sorry it was not recollected	213:225,32A  !
1A	sooner, that I might have written home. But it is of very	213:225,33A  !
1A	little consequence."	213:225,34A  !
1C	"I hope, I earnestly hope that to your real safety it	213:225,35C  !
1C	will be of none; but to every thing else it is of the greatest	213:225,36C  !
1C	consequence; to comfort, appearance, propriety, to your	213:225,37C  !
1C	family, to the world. Were your friends, the Allens, still	213:225,38C  !
1C	in Bath, you might go to them with comparative ease;	213:226, 1C  !
1C	a few hours would take you there; but a journey of	213:226, 2C  !
1C	seventy miles, to be taken post by you, at your age,	213:226, 3C  !
1C	alone, unattended|"	213:226, 4C  !
1A	"Oh, the journey is nothing. Do not think about that.	213:226, 5A  !
1A	And if we are to part, a few hours sooner or later, you	213:226, 6A  !
1A	know, makes no difference. I can be ready by seven.	213:226, 7A  !
1A	Let me be called in time."	213:226, 8A  !
1C	"I shall see you in the morning."	213:226,11C  !
1C	"You \must\ write to me, Catherine,"	213:228,25C  !
1C	"you	213:228,25C  !
1C	\must\ let me hear from you as soon as possible. Till	213:228,26C  !
1C	I know you to be safe at home, I shall not have an hour's	213:228,27C  !
1C	comfort. For \one\ letter, at all risks, all hazards, I must	213:228,28C  !
1C	entreat. Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that	213:228,29C  !
1C	you are safe at Fullerton, and have found your family	213:228,30C  !
1C	well, and then, till I can ask for your correspondence as	213:228,31C  !
1C	I ought to do, I will not expect more. Direct to me at	213:228,32C  !
1C	Lord Longtown's, and, I must ask it, under cover to	213:228,33C  !
1C	Alice."	213:228,34C  !
1A	"No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter	213:228,35A  !
1A	from me, I am sure I had better not write. There can be	213:228,36A  !
1A	no doubt of my getting home safe."	213:228,37A  !
1C	"I cannot wonder at your	213:228,38C  !
1C	feelings. I will not importune you. I will trust to your	213:229, 1C  !
1C	own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you."	213:229, 2C  !
1A	"Oh, Eleanor, I \will\ write to you indeed."	213:229, 5A  !
1A	"No	214:236,13A  !
1A	friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor."	214:236,14A  !
1A	"Yes, but \that\ did not last long,"	214:238,16A  !
1A	"Do I| Oh| perfectly."	214:238,25A  !
1A	"I am sure I do not care about the bread. It is all the	215:241, 7A  !
1A	same to me what I eat."	215:241, 8A  !
1A	"Mr% Henry Tilney,"	215:241,35A  !
2F	"It was my father's last request to me,"	102:  9, 1F  !
2F	"that I should assist his widow and daughters."	102:  9, 2F  !
2F	"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear	102:  9, 8F  !
2F	Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms, to assist	102:  9, 9F  !
2F	them, and make their situation more comfortable than	102:  9,10F  !
2F	it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it would have been as	102:  9,11F  !
2F	well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He could hardly	102:  9,12F  !
2F	suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the	102:  9,13F  !
2F	promise, I could not do less than give it:  at least I thought	102:  9,14F  !
2F	so at the time.  The promise, therefore, was given, and	102:  9,15F  !
2F	must be performed.  Something must be done for them	102:  9,16F  !
2F	whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home."	102:  9,17F  !
2F	"Why, to be sure,"	102:  9,24F  !
2F	"that would make a great difference.  The time may	102:  9,25F  !
2F	come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was	102:  9,26F  !
2F	parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, for	102:  9,27F  !
2F	instance, it would be a very convenient addition."	102:  9,28F  !
2F	"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties if	102:  9,30F  !
2F	the sum were diminished one half. ~ Five hundred pounds	102:  9,31F  !
2F	would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes|"	102:  9,32F  !
2F	"I would not wish to do any thing mean,"	102:  9,37F  !
2F	"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than too	102:  9,38F  !
2F	little.  No one, at least, can think I have not done enough	102: 10, 1F  !
2F	for them:  even themselves, they can hardly expect more."	102: 10, 2F  !
2F	"Certainly ~ and I think I may afford to give them	102: 10, 6F  !
2F	five hundred pounds a-piece.  As it is, without any addition	102: 10, 7F  !
2F	of mine, they will each have above three thousand	102: 10, 8F  !
2F	pounds on their mother's death ~ a very comfortable	102: 10, 9F  !
2F	fortune for any young woman."	102: 10,10F  !
2F	"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know	102: 10,17F  !
2F	whether, upon the whole, it would not be more advisable	102: 10,18F  !
2F	to do something for their mother while she lives rather	102: 10,19F  !
2F	than for them ~ something of the annuity kind I mean. ~	102: 10,20F  !
2F	My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.	102: 10,21F  !
2F	A hundred a year would make them all perfectly	102: 10,22F  !
2F	comfortable."	102: 10,23F  !
2F	"Fifteen years| my dear Fanny; her life cannot be	102: 10,30F  !
2F	worth half that purchase."	102: 10,31F  !
2F	"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,"	102: 11,15F  !
2F	"to have those kind of yearly drains on one's	102: 11,16F  !
2F	income.  One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is	102: 11,17F  !
2F	\not\ one's own.  To be tied down to the regular payment	102: 11,18F  !
2F	of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable:	102: 11,19F  !
2F	it takes away one's independence."	102: 11,20F  !
2F	"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better	102: 11,29F  !
2F	that there should be no annuity in the case; whatever	102: 11,30F  !
2F	I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance	102: 11,31F  !
2F	than a yearly allowance, because they would only	102: 11,32F  !
2F	enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger	102: 11,33F  !
2F	income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at	102: 11,34F  !
2F	the end of the year.  It will certainly be much the best	102: 11,35F  !
2F	way.  A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will	102: 11,36F  !
2F	prevent their ever being distressed for money, and will,	102: 11,37F  !
2F	I think be amply discharging my promise to my father."	102: 11,38F  !
2F	"Upon my word,"	102: 12,28F  !
2F	"I believe you	102: 12,28F  !
2F	are perfectly right.  My father certainly could mean	102: 12,29F  !
2F	nothing more by his request to me than what you say.	102: 12,30F  !
2F	I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil my	102: 12,31F  !
2F	engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to	102: 12,32F  !
2F	them as you have described.  When my mother removes	102: 12,33F  !
2F	into another house my services shall be readily given to	102: 12,34F  !
2F	accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present of	102: 12,35F  !
2F	furniture too may be acceptable then."	102: 12,36F  !
2F	"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A	102: 13, 6F  !
2F	valuable legacy indeed|  And yet some of the plate	102: 13, 7F  !
2F	would have been a very pleasant addition to our own	102: 13, 8F  !
2F	stock here."	102: 13, 9F  !
2D	"It is enough,"	103: 16,22D  !
2D	"to say that he is unlike	103: 16,22D  !
2D	Fanny is enough.  It implies every thing amiable.  I love	103: 16,23D  !
2D	him already."	103: 16,24D  !
2A	"I think you will like him,"	103: 16,25A  !
2A	"when you	103: 16,25A  !
2A	know more of him."	103: 16,26A  !
2D	"Like him|"	103: 16,27D  !
2D	"I	103: 16,27D  !
2D	can feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love."	103: 16,28D  !
2A	"You may esteem him."	103: 16,29A  !
2D	"I have never yet known what it was to separate	103: 16,30D  !
2D	esteem and love."	103: 16,31D  !
2D	"In a few months, my dear Marianne,"	103: 17, 8D  !
2D	"Elinor will in all probability be settled for life.  We	103: 17, 9D  !
2D	shall miss her; but \she\ will be happy."	103: 17,10D  !
2C	"Oh| mama, how shall we do without her?"	103: 17,11C  !
2D	"My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall	103: 17,12D  !
2D	live within a few miles of each other, and shall meet	103: 17,13D  !
2D	every day of our lives.  You will gain a brother, a real,	103: 17,14D  !
2D	affectionate brother.  I have the highest opinion in the	103: 17,15D  !
2D	world of Edward's heart.  But you look grave, Marianne;	103: 17,16D  !
2D	do you disapprove your sister's choice?"	103: 17,17D  !
2C	"Perhaps,"	103: 17,18C  !
2C	"I may consider it with	103: 17,18C  !
2C	some surprise.  Edward is very amiable, and I love him	103: 17,19C  !
2C	tenderly.  But yet ~ he is not the kind of young man ~	103: 17,20C  !
2C	there is a something wanting ~ his figure is not striking;	103: 17,21C  !
2C	it has none of that grace which I should expect in the	103: 17,22C  !
2C	man who could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes	103: 17,23C  !
2C	want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce	103: 17,24C  !
2C	virtue and intelligence.  And besides all this, I am afraid,	103: 17,25C  !
2C	mama, he has no real taste.  Music seems scarcely to	103: 17,26C  !
2C	attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings	103: 17,27C  !
2C	very much, it is not the admiration of a person who can	103: 17,28C  !
2C	understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of his	103: 17,29C  !
2C	frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact	103: 17,30C  !
2C	he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as a lover,	103: 17,31C  !
2C	not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters	103: 17,32C  !
2C	must be united.  I could not be happy with a man whose	103: 17,33C  !
2C	taste did not in every point coincide with my own.  He	103: 17,34C  !
2C	must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the	103: 17,35C  !
2C	same music must charm us both.  Oh| mama, how	103: 17,36C  !
2C	spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading	103: 17,37C  !
2C	to us last night|  I felt for my sister most severely.	103: 17,38C  !
2C	Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed	103: 18, 1C  !
2C	scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep my seat.	103: 18, 2C  !
2C	To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently	103: 18, 3C  !
2C	almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable	103: 18, 4C  !
2C	calmness, such dreadful indifference|" ~	103: 18, 5C  !
2D	"He would certainly have done more justice to	103: 18, 6D  !
2D	simple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time;	103: 18, 7D  !
2D	but you \would\ give him Cowper."	103: 18, 8D  !
2C	"Nay, mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper|	103: 18, 9C  !
2C	~ but we must allow for difference of taste.  Elinor	103: 18,10C  !
2C	has not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it,	103: 18,11C  !
2C	and be happy with him.  But it would have broke \my\	103: 18,12C  !
2C	heart had I loved him, to hear him read with so little	103: 18,13C  !
2C	sensibility.  Mama, the more I know of the world, the	103: 18,14C  !
2C	more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom	103: 18,15C  !
2C	I can really love.  I require so much|  He must have	103: 18,16C  !
2C	all Edward's virtues, and his person and manners must	103: 18,17C  !
2C	ornament his goodness with every possible charm."	103: 18,18C  !
2D	"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.	103: 18,19D  !
2D	It is yet too early in life to despair of such an happiness.	103: 18,20D  !
2D	Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?	103: 18,21D  !
2D	In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your	103: 18,22D  !
2D	destiny be different from her's|"	103: 18,23D  !
2C	"What a pity it is, Elinor",	104: 19, 1C  !
2C	"that	104: 19, 1C  !
2C	Edward should have no taste for drawing."	104: 19, 2C  !
2A	"No taste for drawing,"	104: 19, 3A  !
2A	"why	104: 19, 3A  !
2A	should you think so?  He does not draw himself, indeed,	104: 19, 4A  !
2A	but he has great pleasure in seeing the performance of	104: 19, 5A  !
2A	other people, and I assure you he is by no means deficient	104: 19, 6A  !
2A	in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities	104: 19, 7A  !
2A	of improving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning,	104: 19, 8A  !
2A	I think he would have drawn very well.  He distrusts	104: 19, 9A  !
2A	his own judgment in such matters so much, that he	104: 19,10A  !
2A	is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture;	104: 19,11A  !
2A	but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste,	104: 19,12A  !
2A	which in general direct him perfectly right."	104: 19,13A  !
2A	"I hope, Marianne,"	104: 19,22A  !
2A	"you do not	104: 19,22A  !
2A	consider him as deficient in general taste.  Indeed,	104: 19,23A  !
2A	I think I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour	104: 19,24A  !
2A	to him is perfectly cordial, and if \that\ were your opinion,	104: 19,25A  !
2A	I am sure you could never be civil to him."	104: 19,26A  !
2C	"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is	104: 19,31C  !
2C	not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.  I	104: 19,32C  !
2C	have not had so many opportunities of estimating the	104: 19,33C  !
2C	minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinations and	104: 20, 1C  !
2C	tastes as you have; but I have the highest opinion in	104: 20, 2C  !
2C	the world of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing	104: 20, 3C  !
2C	that is worthy and amiable."	104: 20, 4C  !
2A	"I am sure,"	104: 20, 5A  !
2A	"that his	104: 20, 5A  !
2A	dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such	104: 20, 6A  !
2A	commendation as that.  I do not perceive how you	104: 20, 7A  !
2A	could express yourself more warmly."	104: 20, 8A  !
2A	"Of his sense and his goodness,"	104: 20,11A  !
2A	"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him	104: 20,12A  !
2A	often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.	104: 20,13A  !
2A	The excellence of his understanding and his principles	104: 20,14A  !
2A	can be concealed only by that shyness which too often	104: 20,15A  !
2A	keeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice	104: 20,16A  !
2A	to his solid worth.  But of his minuter propensities as	104: 20,17A  !
2A	you call them, you have from peculiar circumstances	104: 20,18A  !
2A	been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I have	104: 20,19A  !
2A	been at times thrown a good deal together, while you	104: 20,20A  !
2A	have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate	104: 20,21A  !
2A	principle by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of	104: 20,22A  !
2A	him, have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion	104: 20,23A  !
2A	on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,	104: 20,24A  !
2A	I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,	104: 20,25A  !
2A	his enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination	104: 20,26A  !
2A	lively, his observation just and correct, and his taste	104: 20,27A  !
2A	delicate and pure.  His abilities in every respect improve	104: 20,28A  !
2A	as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.	104: 20,29A  !
2A	At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and	104: 20,30A  !
2A	his person can hardly be called handsome, till the expression	104: 20,31A  !
2A	of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the	104: 20,32A  !
2A	general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.  At	104: 20,33A  !
2A	present, I know him so well, that I think him really	104: 20,34A  !
2A	handsome; or, at least, almost so.  What say you,	104: 20,35A  !
2A	Marianne?"	104: 20,36A  !
2C	"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if	104: 20,37C  !
2C	I do not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother,	104: 20,38C  !
2C	I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now	104: 21, 1C  !
2C	do in his heart."	104: 21, 2C  !
2A	"I do not attempt to deny,"	104: 21,13A  !
2A	"that I think	104: 21,13A  !
2A	very highly of him ~ that I greatly esteem, that I like	104: 21,14A  !
2A	him."	104: 21,15A  !
2C	"Esteem him|  Like him|  Cold-hearted Elinor|  Oh|	104: 21,17C  !
2C	worse than cold-hearted|  Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use	104: 21,18C  !
2C	those words again and I will leave the room this moment."	104: 21,19C  !
2A	"Excuse me,"	104: 21,20A  !
2A	"and be assured that I meant no offence to you,	104: 21,21A  !
2A	by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.	104: 21,22A  !
2A	Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;	104: 21,23A  !
2A	believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the	104: 21,24A  !
2A	suspicion ~ the hope of his affection for me may warrant,	104: 21,25A  !
2A	without imprudence or folly.  But farther than this	104: 21,26A  !
2A	you must \not\ believe.  I am by no means assured of	104: 21,27A  !
2A	his regard for me.  There are moments when the extent	104: 21,28A  !
2A	of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully	104: 21,29A  !
2A	known, you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any	104: 21,30A  !
2A	encouragement of my own partiality, by believing or	104: 21,31A  !
2A	calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feel little ~	104: 21,32A  !
2A	scarcely any doubt of his preference.  But there are	104: 21,33A  !
2A	other points to be considered besides his inclination.	104: 21,34A  !
2A	He is very far from being independent.  What his mother	104: 21,35A  !
2A	really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's occasional	104: 21,36A  !
2A	mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never	104: 21,37A  !
2A	been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much	104: 21,38A  !
2A	mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there	104: 22, 1A  !
2A	would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish	104: 22, 2A  !
2A	to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune	104: 22, 3A  !
2A	or high rank."	104: 22, 4A  !
2C	"And you really are not engaged to him|"	104: 22, 8C  !
2C	"Yet it certainly soon will happen.  But two advantages	104: 22, 9C  !
2C	will proceed from this delay.  \I\ shall not lose you so	104: 22,10C  !
2C	soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of	104: 22,11C  !
2C	improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit	104: 22,12C  !
2C	which must be so indispensably necessary to your	104: 22,13C  !
2C	future felicity.  Oh| if he should be so far stimulated	104: 22,14C  !
2C	by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how delightful	104: 22,15C  !

2D	"It is but a cottage,"	105: 25,16D  !
2D	"but I hope	105: 25,16D  !
2D	to see many of my friends in it.  A room or two can	105: 25,17D  !
2D	easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty	105: 25,18D  !
2D	in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find none	105: 25,19D  !
2D	in accommodating them."	105: 25,20D  !

2C	elsewhere| ~ Oh| happy house, could you know what	105: 27,29C  !

2C	perhaps I may view you no more| ~ And you, ye well-known	105: 27,31C  !
2C	trees| ~ but you will continue the same. ~ No	105: 27,32C  !

2D	make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present,	106: 29,20D  !
2D	as it is too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps	106: 29,21D  !
2D	in the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say	106: 29,22D  !
2D	I shall, we may think about building.  These parlours	106: 29,23D  !
2D	are both too small for such parties of our friends as I	106: 29,24D  !
2D	hope to see often collected here; and I have some	106: 29,25D  !
2D	thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with	106: 29,26D  !
2D	perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder	106: 29,27D  !
2D	of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing-room	106: 29,28D  !
2D	which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber	106: 29,29D  !
2D	and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.	106: 29,30D  !
2D	I could wish the stairs were handsome.  But one must	106: 29,31D  !
2D	not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be	106: 29,32D  !
2D	no difficult matter to widen them.  I shall see how	106: 29,33D  !

2C	of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally	108: 37,12C  !

2C	younger than Mrs% Jennings, but he is old enough to	108: 37,14C  !

2D	him already?"	108: 39,10D  !
2C	"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course	108: 39,11C  !
2C	she must."	108: 39,12C  !
2D	"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was	108: 39,13D  !
2D	talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the	108: 39,14D  !
2D	spare bedchamber, she observed that there was no	108: 39,15D  !
2D	immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the	108: 39,16D  !
2D	room would be wanted for some time."	108: 39,17D  !

2C	farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and	108: 39,23C  !
2C	me:  it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother	108: 39,24C  !
2C	to both.  Twice did I leave them purposely together	108: 39,25C  !
2C	in the course of the morning, and each time did he	108: 39,26C  !
2C	most unaccountably follow me out of the room.  And	108: 39,27C  !
2C	Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward, cried not as	108: 39,28C  !
2C	I did.  Even now her self-command is invariable.  When	108: 39,29C  !
2C	is she dejected or melancholy?  When does she try to	108: 39,30C  !
2C	avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"	108: 39,31C  !
2C	"Is there a felicity in the world,"	109: 41,20C  !
2C	"superior to this? ~ Margaret, we will walk here at	109: 41,21C  !
2C	least two hours."	109: 41,22C  !
2D	"You know him then,"	109: 43,30D  !
2D	"And what sort of a young man is he?"	109: 43,33D  !
2C	"And is \that\ all you can say for him?"	109: 43,37C  !
2C	"But what are his manners on	109: 43,38C  !
2C	more intimate acquaintance?  What his pursuits, his	109: 44, 1C  !
2C	talents and genius?"	109: 44, 2C  !
2A	"But who is he?"	109: 44,11A  !
2A	"Where does he	109: 44,11A  !
2A	come from?  Has he a house at Allenham?"	109: 44,12A  !
2D	"I do not believe,"	109: 44,26D  !
2D	"that Mr% Willoughby will be incommoded	109: 44,27D  !
2D	by the attempts of either of \my\ daughters towards	109: 44,28D  !
2D	what you call \catching\ \him\.  It is not an employment	109: 44,29D  !

2C	in them should know no moderation, and leave him no	109: 45, 6C  !
2C	sense of fatigue."	109: 45, 7C  !
2C	"That is an expression, Sir John,"	109: 45,11C  !
2C	"which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every	109: 45,12C  !

2C	""setting one's cap at a man,"" or ""making a conquest,""	109: 45,14C  !
2C	are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and	109: 45,15C  !
2C	illiberal; and if their construction could ever be deemed	109: 45,16C  !

2A	"for \one\ morning I think you have done pretty	110: 47,24A  !
2A	well.  You have already ascertained Mr% Willoughby's	110: 47,25A  !
2A	opinion in almost every matter of importance.  You	110: 47,26A  !
2A	know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are	110: 47,27A  !
2A	certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and	110: 47,28A  !
2A	you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope	110: 47,29A  !
2A	no more than is proper.  But how is your acquaintance	110: 47,30A  !
2A	to be long supported, under such extraordinary dispatch	110: 47,31A  !
2A	of every subject for discourse?  You will soon have	110: 47,32A  !
2A	exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will	110: 47,33A  !
2A	suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty,	110: 47,34A  !
2A	and second marriages, and then you can have nothing	110: 47,35A  !
2A	farther to ask." ~	110: 47,36A  !

2C	just? are my ideas so scanty?  But I see what you	110: 47,38C  !
2C	mean.  I have been too much at my ease, too happy,	110: 48, 1C  !
2C	too frank.  I have erred against every common-place	110: 48, 2C  !
2C	notion of decorum; I have been open and sincere	110: 48, 3C  !
2C	where I ought to have been reserved, spiritless, dull,	110: 48, 4C  !
2C	and deceitful: ~ had I talked only of the weather and	110: 48, 5C  !
2C	the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes,	110: 48, 6C  !

2D	scold her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check	110: 48,10D  !
2D	the delight of your conversation with our new friend." ~	110: 48,11D  !
2D	Marianne was softened in a moment.	110: 48,12D  !
2S	"Brandon is just the kind of man,"	110: 50,16S  !
2S	"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares	110: 50,18S  !
2S	about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody	110: 50,19S  !
2S	remembers to talk to."	110: 50,20S  !
2C	"That is exactly what I think of him,"	110: 50,21C  !
2A	"Do not boast of it, however,"	110: 50,22A  !
2A	"for it	110: 50,22A  !
2A	is injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed by	110: 50,23A  !
2A	all the family at the park, and I never see him myself	110: 50,24A  !
2A	without taking pains to converse with him."	110: 50,25A  !
2S	"That he is patronized by \you\,"	110: 50,26S  !
2S	"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem of the	110: 50,27S  !
2S	others, it is a reproach in itself.  Who would submit to	110: 50,28S  !
2S	the indignity of being approved by such women as Lady Middleton	110: 50,29S  !
2S	and Mrs% Jennings, that could command the	110: 50,30S  !
2S	indifference of any body else?"	110: 50,31S  !
2A	"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself	110: 50,32A  !
2A	and Marianne, will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton	110: 50,33A  !
2A	and her mother.  If their praise is censure,	110: 50,34A  !
2A	your censure may be praise, for they are not more	110: 50,35A  !
2A	undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust."	110: 50,36A  !
2S	"In defence of your protege= you can even be saucy."	110: 50,37S  !
2A	"My protege=, as you call him, is a sensible man;	110: 50,38A  !
2A	and sense will always have attraction for me.  Yes,	110: 51, 1A  !
2A	Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.	110: 51, 2A  !
2A	He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad;	110: 51, 3A  !
2A	has read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him	110: 51, 4A  !
2A	capable of giving me much information on various	110: 51, 5A  !
2A	subjects, and he has always answered my inquiries with	110: 51, 6A  !
2A	the readiness of good-breeding and good nature."	110: 51, 7A  !
2C	"That is to say,"	110: 51, 8C  !
2C	"he has told you that in the East Indies the climate	110: 51, 9C  !
2C	is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome."	110: 51,10C  !
2A	"He \would\ have told me so, I doubt not, had I made	110: 51,11A  !
2A	any such inquiries, but they happened to be points on	110: 51,12A  !
2A	which I had been previously informed."	110: 51,13A  !
2S	"Perhaps,"	110: 51,14S  !
2S	"his observations may	110: 51,14S  !
2S	have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,	110: 51,15S  !
2S	and palanquins."	110: 51,16S  !
2A	"I may venture to say that \his\ observations have	110: 51,17A  !
2A	stretched much farther than \your\ candour.  But why	110: 51,18A  !
2A	should you dislike him?"	110: 51,19A  !
2S	"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary,	110: 51,20S  !
2S	as a very respectable man, who has every body's	110: 51,21S  !
2S	good word and nobody's notice; who has more money	110: 51,22S  !
2S	than he can spend, more time than he knows how to	110: 51,23S  !
2S	employ, and two new coats every year."	110: 51,24S  !
2C	"Add to which,"	110: 51,25C  !
2C	"that he has neither	110: 51,25C  !
2C	genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding has	110: 51,26C  !
2C	no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice	110: 51,27C  !
2C	no expression."	110: 51,28C  !
2A	"You decide on his imperfections so much in the	110: 51,29A  !
2A	mass,"	110: 51,30A  !
2A	"and so much on the strength	110: 51,30A  !
2A	of your own imagination, that the commendation \I\ am	110: 51,31A  !
2A	able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid.	110: 51,32A  !
2A	I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,	110: 51,33A  !
2A	well-informed, of gentle address, and I believe possessing	110: 51,34A  !
2A	an amiable heart."	110: 51,35A  !

2S	But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as	110: 52, 1S  !
2S	you can be artful.  I have three unanswerable reasons	110: 52, 2S  !
2S	for disliking Colonel Brandon:  he has threatened me	110: 52, 3S  !
2S	with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has found	110: 52, 4S  !
2S	fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot	110: 52, 5S  !
2S	persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it will be any	110: 52, 6S  !
2S	satisfaction to you, however, to be told, that I believe	110: 52, 7S  !
2S	his character to be in other respects irreproachable,	110: 52, 8S  !
2S	I am ready to confess it.  And in return for an acknowledgment,	110: 52, 9S  !
2S	which must give me some pain, you cannot	110: 52,10S  !
2S	deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever."	110: 52,11S  !

2A	"No,"	111: 56, 1A  !
2A	"her opinions are all romantic."	111: 56, 1A  !
2H	"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible	111: 56, 2H  !

2A	reflecting on the character of her own father, who had	111: 56, 5A  !
2A	himself two wives, I know not.  A few years however	111: 56, 6A  !
2A	will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common	111: 56, 7A  !
2A	sense and observation; and then they may be more	111: 56, 8A  !
2A	easy to define and to justify than they now are, by any body	111: 56, 9A  !

2H	to the reception of more general opinions."	111: 56,14H  !

2H	disappointed in their first choice, whether from the	111: 56,27H  !
2H	inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,	111: 56,28H  !

2K	is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near	113: 66,24K  !
2K	relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking	113: 66,25K  !
2K	the young ladies."	113: 66,26K  !

2K	"Yes, yes, Mr% Impudence, I know that very well,	113: 67,25K  !
2K	and I was determined to find out \where\ you had been to.	113: 67,26K  !
2K	~ I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.  It is	113: 67,27K  !
2K	a very large one I know, and when I come to see you,	113: 67,28K  !
2K	I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it	113: 67,29K  !
2K	very much, when I was there six years ago."	113: 67,30K  !
2C	"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not	113: 68,11C  !
2C	go there, or that we did not see the house?  Is not it	113: 68,12C  !
2C	what you have often wished to do yourself?"	113: 68,13C  !
2A	"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs% Smith	113: 68,14A  !
2A	was there, and with no other companion than Mr% Willoughby."	113: 68,15A  !
2C	"Mr% Willoughby however is the only person who can	113: 68,17C  !
2C	have a right to shew that house; and as we went in	113: 68,18C  !
2C	an open carriage, it was impossible to have any other	113: 68,19C  !
2C	companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in	113: 68,20C  !
2C	my life."	113: 68,21C  !
2A	"I am afraid,"	113: 68,22A  !
2A	"that the pleasantness	113: 68,22A  !
2A	of an employment does not always evince its propriety."	113: 68,23A  !
2C	"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof	113: 68,24C  !
2C	of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety	113: 68,25C  !
2C	in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at the	113: 68,26C  !
2C	time, for we always know when we are acting wrong,	113: 68,27C  !
2C	and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure."	113: 68,28C  !
2A	"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed	113: 68,29A  !
2A	you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not	113: 68,30A  !
2A	now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct?"	113: 68,31A  !
2C	"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs% Jennings are	113: 68,32C  !
2C	to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all	113: 68,33C  !
2C	offending every moment of our lives.  I value not	113: 68,34C  !
2C	her censure any more than I should do her commendation.	113: 68,35C  !
2C	I am not sensible of having done any thing wrong	113: 68,36C  !
2C	in walking over Mrs% Smith's grounds, or in seeing her	113: 68,37C  !
2C	house.  They will one day be Mr% Willoughby's, and"~~	113: 68,38C  !
2A	"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne,	113: 69, 1A  !
2A	you would not be justified in what you have done."	113: 69, 2A  !
2C	"Perhaps, Elinor, it \was\ rather	113: 69, 6C  !
2C	ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr% Willoughby	113: 69, 7C  !
2C	wanted particularly to shew me the place; and it is	113: 69, 8C  !
2C	a charming house I assure you. ~ There is one remarkably	113: 69, 9C  !
2C	pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice comfortable	113: 69,10C  !
2C	size for constant use, and with modern furniture it	113: 69,11C  !
2C	would be delightful.  It is a corner room, and has	113: 69,12C  !
2C	windows on two sides.  On one side you look across the	113: 69,13C  !
2C	bowling-green, behind the house, to a beautiful hanging wood,	113: 69,14C  !
2C	and on the other you have a view of the church	113: 69,15C  !
2C	and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills	113: 69,16C  !
2C	that we have so often admired.  I did not see it to	113: 69,17C  !
2C	advantage, for nothing could be more forlorn than the	113: 69,18C  !
2C	furniture, ~ but if it were newly fitted up ~ a couple	113: 69,19C  !
2C	of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it	113: 69,20C  !
2C	one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England."	113: 69,21C  !
2K	"Something very melancholy must be the matter,	114: 70,12K  !
2K	I am sure,"	114: 70,13K  !
2K	"I could see it in his face.  Poor	114: 70,13K  !
2K	man|  I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.  The	114: 70,14K  !
2K	estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two	114: 70,15K  !
2K	thousand a year, and his brother left every thing sadly	114: 70,16K  !
2K	involved.  I do think he must have been sent for about	114: 70,17K  !
2K	money matters, for what else can it be?  I wonder	114: 70,18K  !
2K	whether it is so.  I would give any thing to know the	114: 70,19K  !
2K	truth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams ~ and,	114: 70,20K  !
2K	by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked so conscious	114: 70,21K  !
2K	when I mentioned her.  May be she is ill in town;	114: 70,22K  !
2K	nothing in the world more likely, for I have a notion	114: 70,23K  !
2K	she is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is	114: 70,24K  !
2K	about Miss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should	114: 70,25K  !
2K	be distressed in his circumstances \now\, for he is a very	114: 70,26K  !
2K	prudent man, and to be sure must have cleared the	114: 70,27K  !
2K	estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be|  May be	114: 70,28K  !
2K	his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him	114: 70,29K  !
2K	over.  His setting off in such a hurry seems very like	114: 70,30K  !
2K	it.  Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my	114: 70,31K  !
2K	heart, and a good wife into the bargain."	114: 70,32K  !
2S	"What|"	114: 72,14S  !
2S	"Improve this dear cottage|	114: 72,14S  !
2S	No.  \That\ I will never consent to.  Not a stone	114: 72,15S  !
2S	must be added to its walls, not an inch to its size, if my	114: 72,16S  !
2S	feelings are regarded."	114: 72,17S  !
2A	"Do not be alarmed,"	114: 72,18A  !
2A	"nothing	114: 72,18A  !
2A	of the kind will be done; for my mother will never have	114: 72,19A  !
2A	money enough to attempt it."	114: 72,20A  !
2S	"I am heartily glad of it,"	114: 72,21S  !
2S	"May she	114: 72,21S  !
2S	always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better."	114: 72,22S  !
2D	"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured	114: 72,23D  !
2D	that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment	114: 72,24D  !
2D	of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the	114: 72,25D  !
2D	improvements in the world.  Depend upon it that whatever	114: 72,26D  !
2D	unemployed sum may remain, when I make up	114: 72,27D  !
2D	my accounts in the spring, I would even rather lay it	114: 72,28D  !
2D	uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful	114: 72,29D  !
2D	to you.  But are you really so attached to this place as	114: 72,30D  !
2D	to see no defect in it?"	114: 72,31D  !
2S	"I am,"	114: 72,32S  !
2S	"To me it is faultless.  Nay, more,	114: 72,32S  !
2S	I consider it as the only form of building in which	114: 72,33S  !
2S	happiness is attainable, and were I rich enough, I would	114: 72,34S  !
2S	instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in	114: 72,35S  !
2S	the exact plan of this cottage."	114: 72,36S  !
2A	"With dark narrow stairs, and a kitchen that smokes,	114: 72,37A  !
2A	I suppose,"	114: 72,38A  !
2S	"Yes,"	114: 73, 1S  !
2S	"with all	114: 73, 1S  !
2S	and every thing belonging to it; ~ in no one convenience	114: 73, 2S  !
2S	or \in\convenience about it, should the least variation be	114: 73, 3S  !
2S	perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof,	114: 73, 4S  !
2S	I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been	114: 73, 5S  !
2S	at Barton."	114: 73, 6S  !
2A	"I flatter myself,"	114: 73, 7A  !
2A	"that even under	114: 73, 7A  !
2A	the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,	114: 73, 8A  !
2A	you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as	114: 73, 9A  !
2A	you now do this."	114: 73,10A  !
2S	"There certainly are circumstances,"	114: 73,11S  !
2S	"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place	114: 73,12S  !
2S	will always have one claim on my affection, which no	114: 73,13S  !
2S	other can possibly share."	114: 73,14S  !
2S	"How often did I wish,"	114: 73,18S  !
2S	"when I was at	114: 73,18S  !
2S	Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage	114: 73,19S  !
2S	were inhabited|  I never passed within view of it without	114: 73,20S  !
2S	admiring its situation, and grieving that no one should	114: 73,21S  !
2S	live in it.  How little did I then think that the very	114: 73,22S  !
2S	first news I should hear from Mrs% Smith, when I next	114: 73,23S  !
2S	came into the country, would be that Barton cottage	114: 73,24S  !
2S	was taken:  and I felt an immediate satisfaction and	114: 73,25S  !
2S	interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of	114: 73,26S  !
2S	prescience of what happiness I should experience from	114: 73,27S  !
2S	it, can account for.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?"	114: 73,28S  !
2S	"And yet this house you would	114: 73,30S  !
2S	spoil, Mrs% Dashwood?  You would rob it of its simplicity	114: 73,31S  !
2S	by imaginary improvement|  and this dear parlour,	114: 73,32S  !
2S	in which our acquaintance first began, and in which so	114: 73,33S  !
2S	many happy hours have been since spent by us together,	114: 73,34S  !
2S	you would degrade to the condition of a common	114: 73,35S  !
2S	entrance, and every body would be eager to pass through	114: 73,36S  !
2S	the room which has hitherto contained within itself,	114: 73,37S  !
2S	more real accommodation and comfort than any other	114: 73,38S  !
2S	apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world	114: 74, 1S  !

2S	it will make me happy.  Tell me that not only your	114: 74, 7S  !
2S	house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find	114: 74, 8S  !
2S	you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and	114: 74, 9S  !
2S	that you will always consider me with the kindness	114: 74,10S  !

2S	of riches upon a poor dependant cousin, by sending me on	115: 75,33S  !
2S	business to London.  I have just received my dispatches,	115: 76, 1S  !
2S	and taken my farewel of Allenham; and by way of	115: 76, 2S  !
2S	exhilaration I am now come to take my farewel of you."	115: 76, 3S  !

2A	intending to return| ~ Something more than what	115: 77,35A  !
2A	he owned to us must have happened.  He did not speak,	115: 77,36A  !
2A	he did not behave like himself.  \You\ must have seen the	115: 77,37A  !
2A	difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they have	115: 77,38A  !
2A	quarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such	115: 78, 1A  !
2A	unwillingness to accept your invitation here?" ~	115: 78, 2A  !
2D	"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor;	115: 78, 3D  !
2D	I could plainly see \that\.  He had not the power of	115: 78, 4D  !
2D	accepting it.  I have thought it all over I assure you,	115: 78, 5D  !
2D	and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first	115: 78, 6D  !
2D	seemed strange to me as well as to you."	115: 78, 7D  !
2A	"Can you indeed?"	115: 78, 8A  !
2D	"Yes.  I have explained it to myself in the most	115: 78, 9D  !
2D	satisfactory way; ~ but you, Elinor, who love to doubt	115: 78,10D  !
2D	where you can ~~ It will not satisfy \you\, I know; but	115: 78,11D  !
2D	you shall not talk \me\ out of my trust in it.  I am persuaded	115: 78,12D  !
2D	that Mrs% Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,	115: 78,13D  !
2D	disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views	115: 78,14D  !
2D	for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away; ~	115: 78,15D  !
2D	and that the business which she sends him off to transact,	115: 78,16D  !
2D	is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  This is what	115: 78,17D  !
2D	I believe to have happened.  He is moreover aware that	115: 78,18D  !
2D	she \does\ disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore	115: 78,19D  !
2D	at present confess to her his engagement with	115: 78,20D  !
2D	Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent	115: 78,21D  !
2D	situation, to give into her schemes, and absent	115: 78,22D  !
2D	himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me,	115: 78,23D  !
2D	I know, that this may, or may \not\ have happened;	115: 78,24D  !
2D	but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can point out	115: 78,25D  !
2D	any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory	115: 78,26D  !
2D	as this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?"	115: 78,27D  !
2A	"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer."	115: 78,28A  !
2D	"Then you would have told me, that it might or	115: 78,29D  !
2D	might not have happened.  Oh|  Elinor, how incomprehensible	115: 78,30D  !
2D	are your feelings|  You had rather take evil	115: 78,31D  !
2D	upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for	115: 78,32D  !
2D	misery for Marianne and guilt for poor Willoughby,	115: 78,33D  !
2D	than an apology for the latter.  You are resolved to	115: 78,34D  !
2D	think him blameable, because he took leave of us with	115: 78,35D  !
2D	less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And	115: 78,36D  !
2D	is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for	115: 78,37D  !
2D	spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are no	115: 78,38D  !
2D	probabilities to be accepted, merely because they are	115: 79, 1D  !
2D	not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we	115: 79, 2D  !
2D	have all so much reason to love, and no reason in the	115: 79, 3D  !
2D	world to think ill of?  To the possibility of motives	115: 79, 4D  !
2D	unanswerable in themselves, though unavoidably secret	115: 79, 5D  !
2D	for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspect	115: 79, 6D  !
2D	him of?"	115: 79, 7D  !
2A	"I can hardly tell you myself. ~ But suspicion of	115: 79, 8A  !
2A	something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of	115: 79, 9A  !
2A	such an alteration as we have just witnessed in him.	115: 79,10A  !
2A	There is great truth, however, in what you have now	115: 79,11A  !
2A	urged of the allowances which ought to be made for	115: 79,12A  !
2A	him, and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of	115: 79,13A  !
2A	every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly have very	115: 79,14A  !
2A	sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that	115: 79,15A  !
2A	he has.  But it would have been more like Willoughby	115: 79,16A  !
2A	to acknowledge them at once.  Secrecy may be advisable;	115: 79,17A  !
2A	but still I cannot help wondering at its being	115: 79,18A  !
2A	practised by him."	115: 79,19A  !
2D	"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his	115: 79,20D  !
2D	character, where the deviation is necessary.  But you	115: 79,21D  !
2D	really do admit the justice of what I have said in his	115: 79,22D  !
2D	defence? ~ I am happy ~ and he is acquitted."	115: 79,23D  !
2A	"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their	115: 79,24A  !
2A	engagement (if they \are\ engaged) from Mrs% Smith ~	115: 79,25A  !
2A	and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient for	115: 79,26A  !
2A	Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.	115: 79,27A  !
2A	But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us."	115: 79,28A  !
2D	"Concealing it from us|  my dear child, do you	115: 79,29D  !
2D	accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment?  This	115: 79,30D  !
2D	is strange indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching	115: 79,31D  !
2D	them every day for incautiousness."	115: 79,32D  !
2A	"I want no proof of their affection,"	115: 79,33A  !
2A	"but of their engagement I do."	115: 79,34A  !
2D	"I am perfectly satisfied of both."	115: 79,35D  !
2A	"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the	115: 79,36A  !
2A	subject, by either of them."	115: 79,37A  !
2D	"I have not wanted syllables where actions have	115: 79,38D  !
2D	spoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour to Marianne	115: 80, 1D  !
2D	and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared	115: 80, 2D  !
2D	that he loved and considered her as his future wife,	115: 80, 3D  !
2D	and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest	115: 80, 4D  !
2D	relation?  Have we not perfectly understood each other?	115: 80, 5D  !
2D	Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his	115: 80, 6D  !
2D	manner, his attentive and affectionate respect?  My	115: 80, 7D  !
2D	Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How	115: 80, 8D  !
2D	could such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be	115: 80, 9D  !
2D	supposed that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be	115: 80,10D  !
2D	of your sister's love, should leave her, and leave her	115: 80,11D  !
2D	perhaps for months, without telling her of his affection;	115: 80,12D  !
2D	~ that they should part without a mutual exchange	115: 80,13D  !
2D	of confidence?"	115: 80,14D  !
2A	"I confess,"	115: 80,15A  !
2A	"that every circumstance	115: 80,15A  !
2A	except \one\ is in favour of their engagement; but that	115: 80,16A  !
2A	\one\ is the total silence of both on the subject, and with	115: 80,17A  !
2A	me it almost outweighs every other."	115: 80,18A  !
2D	"How strange this is|  You must think wretchedly	115: 80,19D  !
2D	indeed of Willoughby, if after all that has openly passed	115: 80,20D  !
2D	between them, you can doubt the nature of the terms	115: 80,21D  !
2D	on which they are together.  Has he been acting a part	115: 80,22D  !
2D	in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you	115: 80,23D  !
2D	suppose him really indifferent to her?"	115: 80,24D  !
2A	"No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love	115: 80,25A  !
2A	her I am sure."	115: 80,26A  !
2D	"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can	115: 80,27D  !
2D	leave her with such indifference, such carelessness of	115: 80,28D  !
2D	the future, as you attribute to him."	115: 80,29D  !
2A	"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have	115: 80,30A  !
2A	never considered this matter as certain.  I have had my	115: 80,31A  !
2A	doubts, I confess; but they are fainter than they were,	115: 80,32A  !
2A	and they may soon be entirely done away.  If we find	115: 80,33A  !
2A	they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed."	115: 80,34A  !
2D	"A mighty concession indeed|  If you were to see	115: 80,35D  !
2D	them at the altar, you would suppose they were going	115: 80,36D  !
2D	to be married.  Ungracious girl|  But \I\ require no such	115: 80,37D  !
2D	proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify	115: 80,38D  !
2D	doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been	115: 81, 1D  !
2D	uniformly open and unreserved.  You cannot doubt	115: 81, 2D  !
2D	your sister's wishes.  It must be Willoughby therefore	115: 81, 3D  !
2D	whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man of	115: 81, 4D  !
2D	honour and feeling?  Has there been any inconsistency	115: 81, 5D  !
2D	on his side to create alarm?  can he be deceitful?"	115: 81, 6D  !
2A	"I hope not, I believe not,"	115: 81, 7A  !
2A	"I love	115: 81, 7A  !
2A	Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his	115: 81, 8A  !
2A	integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to	115: 81, 9A  !
2A	me.  It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage	115: 81,10A  !
2A	it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his	115: 81,11A  !
2A	manners this morning; ~ he did not speak like himself,	115: 81,12A  !
2A	and did not return your kindness with any cordiality.	115: 81,13A  !
2A	But all this may be explained by such a situation of	115: 81,14A  !
2A	his affairs as you have supposed.  He had just parted	115: 81,15A  !
2A	from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest	115: 81,16A  !
2A	affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending	115: 81,17A  !
2A	Mrs% Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here	115: 81,18A  !
2A	soon, and yet aware that by declining your invitation,	115: 81,19A  !
2A	by saying that he was going away for some time, he	115: 81,20A  !
2A	should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by	115: 81,21A  !
2A	our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed.	115: 81,22A  !
2A	In such a case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties	115: 81,23A  !
2A	would have been more to his honour I think, as well as	115: 81,24A  !
2A	more consistent with his general character; ~ but I will	115: 81,25A  !
2A	not raise objections against any one's conduct on so	115: 81,26A  !
2A	illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from	115: 81,27A  !
2A	myself, or a deviation from what I may think right	115: 81,28A  !
2A	and consistent."	115: 81,29A  !
2D	"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly	115: 81,30D  !
2D	does not deserve to be suspected.  Though \we\ have not	115: 81,31D  !
2D	known him long, he is no stranger in this part of the	115: 81,32D  !
2D	world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?	115: 81,33D  !
2D	Had he been in a situation to act independently and	115: 81,34D  !
2D	marry immediately, it might have been odd that he	115: 81,35D  !
2D	should leave us without acknowledging every thing to	115: 81,36D  !
2D	me at once:  but this is not the case.  It is an engagement	115: 81,37D  !
2D	in some respects not prosperously begun, for their	115: 81,38D  !
2D	marriage must be at a very uncertain distance; and	115: 82, 1D  !
2D	even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now be	115: 82, 2D  !
2D	very advisable."	115: 82, 3D  !
2D	"Remember, Elinor,"	116: 84,10D  !
2D	"how very often	116: 84,10D  !
2D	Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post, and	116: 84,11D  !
2D	carries them to it.  We have already agreed that secrecy	116: 84,12D  !
2D	may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it	116: 84,13D  !
2D	could not be maintained if their correspondence were	116: 84,14D  !
2D	to pass through Sir John's hands."	116: 84,15D  !
2A	"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,"	116: 84,22A  !
2A	"whether she is or is not engaged to Willoughby?	116: 84,23A  !
2A	From you, her mother, and so kind, so indulgent	116: 84,24A  !
2A	a mother, the question could not give offence.  It	116: 84,25A  !
2A	would be the natural result of your affection for her.	116: 84,26A  !
2A	She used to be all unreserve, and to you more especially."	116: 84,27A  !
2D	"I would not ask such a question for the world.	116: 84,28D  !
2D	Supposing it possible that they are not engaged, what	116: 84,29D  !
2D	distress would not such an inquiry inflict|  At any rate	116: 84,30D  !
2D	it would be most ungenerous.  I should never deserve	116: 84,31D  !
2D	her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession	116: 84,32D  !
2D	of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to	116: 84,33D  !
2D	any one.  I know Marianne's heart:  I know that she	116: 84,34D  !
2D	dearly loves me, and that I shall not be the last to whom	116: 84,35D  !
2D	the affair is made known, when circumstances make the	116: 84,36D  !
2D	revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force	116: 84,37D  !
2D	the confidence of any one; of a child much less; because	116: 84,38D  !
2D	a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her	116: 85, 1D  !
2D	wishes might direct."	116: 85, 2D  !
2D	"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our	116: 85,14D  !
2D	dear Willoughby went away before we could get through	116: 85,15D  !
2D	it.  We will put it by, that when he comes again~~	116: 85,16D  !
2D	But it may be months, perhaps, before \that\ happens."	116: 85,17D  !
2C	"Months|"	116: 85,18C  !
2C	"No ~ nor many weeks."	116: 85,19C  !
2C	"It is he; it is indeed; ~ I know it is|" ~	116: 86,13C  !
2A	"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is	116: 86,15A  !
2A	not Willoughby.  The person is not tall enough for him,	116: 86,16A  !
2A	and has not his air."	116: 86,17A  !
2C	"He has, he has,"	116: 86,18C  !
2C	"I am sure he has.	116: 86,18C  !
2C	His air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would	116: 86,19C  !
2C	come."	116: 86,20C  !
2C	"A fortnight|" she repeated, surprised at his being	116: 87,25C  !
2C	so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing	116: 87,26C  !
2C	her before.	116: 87,27C  !

2B	"I was at Norland about a month ago."	116: 87,31B  !

2A	"Dear, dear Norland,"	116: 87,34A  !
2A	"probably looks	116: 87,34A  !
2A	much as it always does at this time of year.  The woods	116: 87,35A  !
2A	and walks thickly covered with dead leaves."	116: 87,36A  !

2C	season, the air altogether inspired|  Now there is no one	116: 88, 3C  !

2A	"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of	117: 93,29A  !
2A	mistakes,"	117: 93,30A  !
2A	"in a total misapprehension of	117: 93,30A  !

2A	much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than	117: 93,32A  !
2A	they really are, and I can hardly tell why, or in what	117: 93,33A  !
2A	the deception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by	117: 93,34A  !
2A	what they say of themselves, and very frequently by	117: 93,35A  !
2A	what other people say of them, without giving oneself	117: 93,36A  !
2A	time to deliberate and judge."	117: 93,37A  !

2A	You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty,	117: 94, 8A  !

2B	so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am	117: 94,21B  !

2B	"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,"	117: 94,28B  !
2B	"Shyness is only the effect of a sense	117: 94,29B  !
2B	of inferiority in some way or other.  If I could persuade	117: 94,30B  !
2B	myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,	117: 94,31B  !
2B	I should not be shy."	117: 94,32B  !

2A	"Do not you	117: 95, 4A  !
2A	know my sister well enough to understand what she	117: 95, 5A  !
2A	means?  Do not you know that she calls every one	117: 95, 6A  !
2A	reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she	117: 95, 7A  !
2A	admires as rapturously as herself?"	117: 95, 8A  !

2B	"as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be	118: 96,20B  !
2B	back again presently."	118: 96,21B  !
2B	"You must not inquire too far, Marianne ~	118: 96,32B  !
2B	remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque, and	118: 96,33B  !
2B	I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste	118: 97, 1B  !
2B	if we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which	118: 97, 2B  !
2B	ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which	118: 97, 3B  !
2B	ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant objects	118: 97, 4B  !
2B	out of sight, which ought only to be indistinct through	118: 97, 5B  !
2B	the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must be	118: 97, 6B  !
2B	satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.	118: 97, 7B  !
2B	I call it a very fine country ~ the hills are steep, the woods	118: 97, 8B  !
2B	seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable	118: 97, 9B  !
2B	and snug ~ with rich meadows and several neat farm	118: 97,10B  !
2B	houses scattered here and there.  It exactly answers	118: 97,11B  !
2B	my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty	118: 97,12B  !
2B	with utility ~ and I dare say it is a picturesque one too,	118: 97,13B  !
2B	because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full	118: 97,14B  !
2B	of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush wood,	118: 97,15B  !
2B	but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing of the	118: 97,16B  !
2B	picturesque."	118: 97,17B  !
2C	"I am afraid it is but too true,"	118: 97,18C  !
2C	"but why should you boast of it?"	118: 97,19C  !
2A	"I suspect,"	118: 97,20A  !
2A	"that to avoid one kind of	118: 97,20A  !
2A	affectation, Edward here falls into another.  Because he	118: 97,21A  !
2A	believes many people pretend to more admiration of	118: 97,22A  !
2A	the beauties of nature than they really feel, and is	118: 97,23A  !
2A	disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater	118: 97,24A  !
2A	indifference and less discrimination in viewing them	118: 97,25A  !
2A	himself than he possesses.  He is fastidious and will	118: 97,26A  !

2C	"It is very true,"	118: 97,28C  !
2C	"that admiration	118: 97,28C  !

2C	taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque	118: 97,31C  !
2C	beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind,	118: 97,32C  !
2C	and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,	118: 97,33C  !

2B	to feel.  But, in return, your sister must allow me to	118: 98, 1B  !
2B	feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect, but	118: 98, 2B  !
2B	not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked,	118: 98, 3B  !
2B	twisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if	118: 98, 4B  !
2B	they are tall, straight and flourishing.  I do not like	118: 98, 5B  !
2B	ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles, or	118: 98, 6B  !
2B	thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in	118: 98, 7B  !
2B	a snug farm-house than a watch-tower ~ and a troop of	118: 98, 8B  !

2B	any thing like independence.  But unfortunately my	119:102,32B  !
2B	own nicety, and the nicety of my friends, have made me	119:102,33B  !
2B	what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We never could	119:102,34B  !
2B	agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred	119:102,35B  !
2B	the church, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough	119:102,36B  !
2B	for my family.  They recommended the army.  That	119:102,37B  !
2B	was a great deal too smart for me.  The law was allowed	119:102,38B  !

2P	in Exeter; but you know, how could I tell what smart	121:123,28P  !
2P	beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only	121:123,29P  !
2P	afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton,	121:123,30P  !

2Q	Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to	122:130,38Q  !
2Q	be sensible he is very capable of making a woman	122:131, 1Q  !
2Q	sincerely attached to him."	122:131, 2Q  !
2A	"Certainly,"	122:131, 3A  !
2A	"Engaged to Mr% Edward Ferrars|	122:131, 6A  !
2A	~ I confess myself so totally surprised	122:131, 7A  !
2A	at what you tell me, that really ~ I beg your pardon;	122:131, 8A  !
2A	but surely there must be some mistake of person or	122:131, 9A  !
2A	name.  We cannot mean the same Mr% Ferrars."	122:131,10A  !

2Q	Park-street, and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs% John Dashwood,	122:131,13Q  !

2Q	\I\ am not likely to be deceived, as to the name of the man	122:131,15Q  !
2Q	on who all my happiness depends."	122:131,16Q  !
2A	"It is strange,"	122:131,17A  !
2A	"that I should never have heard him even	122:131,18A  !
2A	mention your name."	122:131,19A  !
2Q	"No; considering our situation, it was not strange.	122:131,20Q  !
2Q	Our first care has been to keep the matter secret. ~ You	122:131,21Q  !
2Q	knew nothing of me, or my family, and therefore there	122:131,22Q  !
2Q	could be no \occasion\ for ever mentioning my name to	122:131,23Q  !
2Q	you, and as he was always particularly afraid of his	122:131,24Q  !
2Q	sister's suspecting any thing, \that\ was reason enough	122:131,25Q  !
2Q	for his not mentioning it."	122:131,26Q  !
2A	"Four years you have been engaged,"	122:131,29A  !
2Q	"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may	122:131,31Q  !
2Q	have to wait.  Poor Edward|  It puts him quite out	122:131,32Q  !
2Q	of heart."	122:131,33Q  !
2Q	"To prevent the possibility of	122:131,34Q  !
2Q	mistake, be so good as to look at this face.  It does not	122:131,35Q  !
2Q	do him justice to be sure, but yet I think you cannot be	122:131,36Q  !
2Q	deceived as to the person it was drew of. ~ I have had	122:131,37Q  !
2Q	it above these three years."	122:131,38Q  !

2Q	"to give	122:132, 7Q  !
2Q	him my picture in return, which I am very much	122:132, 8Q  !
2Q	vexed at, for he has been always so anxious to get it|	122:132, 9Q  !
2Q	But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity."	122:132,10Q  !
2A	"You are quite in the right;"	122:132,12A  !

2Q	know of what importance it is to us, not to have it	122:132,17Q  !
2Q	reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,	122:132,18Q  !
2Q	I dare say.  I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is	122:132,19Q  !
2Q	an exceeding proud woman."	122:132,20Q  !

2A	"but you do me no more than justice in	122:132,22A  !
2A	imagining that I may be depended on.  Your secret	122:132,23A  !
2A	is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some	122:132,24A  !
2A	surprise at so unnecessary a communication.  You must	122:132,25A  !
2A	at least have felt that my being acquainted with it	122:132,26A  !
2A	could not add to its safety."	122:132,27A  !

2Q	I have not known you long to be sure, personally at	122:132,34Q  !
2Q	least, but I have known you and all your family by	122:132,35Q  !
2Q	description a great while; and as soon as I saw you,	122:132,36Q  !
2Q	I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance.  Besides	122:132,37Q  !
2Q	in the present case, I really thought some explanation	122:132,38Q  !
2Q	was due to you after my making such particular inquiries	122:133, 1Q  !
2Q	about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate,	122:133, 2Q  !
2Q	that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask.  Anne	122:133, 3Q  !
2Q	is the only person that knows of it, and she has no	122:133, 4Q  !
2Q	judgment at all; indeed she does me a great deal more	122:133, 5Q  !
2Q	harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her betraying	122:133, 6Q  !
2Q	me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,	122:133, 7Q  !
2Q	as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest	122:133, 8Q  !
2Q	fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name	122:133, 9Q  !
2Q	was mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it	122:133,10Q  !
2Q	all.  You can't think how much I go through in my mind	122:133,11Q  !
2Q	from it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after	122:133,12Q  !
2Q	what I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four	122:133,13Q  !
2Q	years.  Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty;	122:133,14Q  !
2Q	and seeing him so seldom ~ we can hardly meet above	122:133,15Q  !
2Q	twice a-year.  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite	122:133,16Q  !
2Q	broke."	122:133,17Q  !
2Q	"Sometimes,"	122:133,20Q  !
2Q	"I think whether it would not be better for us both, to	122:133,21Q  !
2Q	break off the matter entirely."	122:133,22Q  !
2Q	"But then at other	122:133,23Q  !
2Q	times I have not resolution enough for it. ~ I cannot	122:133,24Q  !
2Q	bear the thoughts of making him so miserable, as I	122:133,25Q  !
2Q	know the very mention of such a thing would do.  And	122:133,26Q  !
2Q	on my own account too ~ so dear as he is to me ~ I	122:133,27Q  !
2Q	don't think I could be equal to it.  What would you	122:133,28Q  !
2Q	advise me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What	122:133,29Q  !
2Q	would you do yourself?"	122:133,30Q  !
2A	"Pardon me,"	122:133,31A  !
2A	"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.	122:133,32A  !
2A	Your own judgment must direct you."	122:133,33A  !
2Q	"To be sure,"	122:133,34Q  !
2Q	"his mother must provide for	122:133,35Q  !
2Q	him sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast	122:133,36Q  !
2Q	down about it|  Did not you think him dreadful low-spirited	122:133,37Q  !
2Q	when he was at Barton?  He was so miserable	122:133,38Q  !
2Q	when he left us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was	122:134, 1Q  !
2Q	afraid you would think him quite ill."	122:134, 2Q  !
2A	"Did he come from your uncle's then, when he	122:134, 3A  !

2Q	"Oh| yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.	122:134, 5Q  !
2Q	Did you think he came directly from town?"	122:134, 6Q  !
2A	"No,"	122:134, 7A  !
2A	"I	122:134, 8A  !
2A	remember he told us, that he had been staying a fortnight	122:134, 9A  !
2A	with some friends near Plymouth."	122:134,10A  !
2Q	"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?"	122:134,14Q  !
2A	"We did indeed, particularly so when he first arrived."	122:134,16A  !
2Q	"I begged him to exert himself for fear you should	122:134,17Q  !
2Q	suspect what was the matter; but it made him so	122:134,18Q  !
2Q	melancholy, not being able to stay more than a fortnight	122:134,19Q  !
2Q	with us, and seeing me so much affected. ~ Poor fellow|	122:134,20Q  !
2Q	~ I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he	122:134,21Q  !
2Q	writes in wretched spirits.  I heard from him just before	122:134,22Q  !

2Q	his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is	122:134,25Q  !
2Q	not written so well as usual. ~ He was tired, I dare say,	122:134,26Q  !
2Q	for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible."	122:134,27Q  !
2Q	"Writing to each other,"	122:135, 1Q  !
2Q	"is the only comfort we have in	122:135, 2Q  !
2Q	such long separations.  Yes, \I\ have one other comfort	122:135, 3Q  !
2Q	in his picture; but poor Edward has not even \that\.	122:135, 4Q  !
2Q	If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.	122:135, 5Q  !
2Q	I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was	122:135, 6Q  !
2Q	at Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him,	122:135, 7Q  !
2Q	he said, but not equal to a picture.  Perhaps you might	122:135, 8Q  !
2Q	notice the ring when you saw him?"	122:135, 9Q  !
2A	"I did;"	122:135,10A  !

2Q	"Thank you,"	202:146, 6Q  !
2Q	"for breaking the	202:146, 6Q  !

2A	the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to	202:146,14A  !
2A	me?"	202:146,15A  !
2Q	"And yet I do assure you,"	202:146,16Q  !
2Q	"there seemed to me to be	202:146,17Q  !
2Q	a coldness and displeasure in your manner, that made	202:146,18Q  !

2A	be assured that you shall never have reason to repent	202:146,30A  !
2A	it.  Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to	202:146,31A  !

2A	need of all your mutual affection to support you under	202:146,33A  !

2Q	own part, I could give up every prospect of more without	202:147, 5Q  !
2Q	a sigh.  I have been always used to a very small income,	202:147, 6Q  !
2Q	and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love	202:147, 7Q  !

2Q	perhaps, of all that his mother might give him if he	202:147, 9Q  !
2Q	married to please her.  We must wait, it may be for	202:147,10Q  !
2Q	many years.  With almost every other man in the world,	202:147,11Q  !

2Q	so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.	202:147,27Q  !

2Q	"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has	202:149, 9Q  !
2Q	lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear;	202:149,10Q  !
2Q	indeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you	202:149,11Q  !
2Q	are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen enough	202:149,12Q  !
2Q	of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to	202:149,13Q  !
2Q	every other profession; now my plan is that he should	202:149,14Q  !
2Q	take orders as soon as he can, and then through your	202:149,15Q  !
2Q	interest, which I am sure you would be kind enough to	202:149,16Q  !
2Q	use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some	202:149,17Q  !
2Q	regard to me, your brother might be persuaded to give	202:149,18Q  !
2Q	him Norland living; which I understand is a very good	202:149,19Q  !
2Q	one, and the present incumbent not likely to live a great	202:149,20Q  !
2Q	while.  That would be enough for us to marry upon,	202:149,21Q  !
2Q	and we might trust to time and chance for the rest."	202:149,22Q  !
2A	"I should be always happy,"	202:149,23A  !
2A	"to shew	202:149,23A  !
2A	any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr% Ferrars;	202:149,24A  !
2A	but do not you perceive that my interest on such an	202:149,25A  !
2A	occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is brother	202:149,26A  !
2A	to Mrs% John Dashwood ~ \that\ must be recommendation	202:149,27A  !
2A	enough to her husband."	202:149,28A  !

2A	very little."	202:149,32A  !
2Q	"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end	202:149,35Q  !
2Q	to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.	202:149,36Q  !
2Q	We seem so beset with difficulties on every side, that	202:149,37Q  !
2Q	though it would make us miserable for a time, we should	202:149,38Q  !
2Q	be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will not give	202:150, 1Q  !
2Q	me your advice, Miss Dashwood?"	202:150, 2Q  !
2A	"No;"	202:150, 3A  !
2A	"on such a subject I certainly	202:150, 4A  !
2A	will not.  You know very well that my opinion	202:150, 5A  !
2A	would have no weight with you, unless it were on the	202:150, 6A  !
2A	side of your wishes."	202:150, 7A  !
2Q	"Indeed you wrong me,"	202:150, 8Q  !
2Q	"I know nobody of whose judgment I think	202:150, 9Q  !
2Q	so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe, that	202:150,10Q  !
2Q	if you was to say to me, ""I advise you by all means to	202:150,11Q  !

2Q	it will be more for the happiness of both of you,"" I should	202:150,13Q  !
2Q	resolve upon doing it immediately."	202:150,14Q  !
2A	"this compliment would effectually	202:150,16A  !
2A	frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had	202:150,17A  !
2A	I formed one.  It raises my influence much too high;	202:150,18A  !
2A	the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached	202:150,19A  !
2A	is too much for an indifferent person."	202:150,20A  !

2Q	biassed in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion	202:150,25Q  !

2Q	me such pleasure to meet you there|  But I dare say	202:150,38Q  !
2Q	you will go for all that.  To be sure, your brother and	202:151, 1Q  !
2Q	sister will ask you to come to them."	202:151, 2Q  !

2Q	us to visit them these several years|  But I only go for	202:151, 8Q  !
2Q	the sake of seeing Edward.  He will be there in February,	202:151, 9Q  !

2K	I shan't put myself at all out of my way for you.  It	203:153,24K  !

2K	I can afford \that\.  We three shall be able to go very	203:153,26K  !

2K	not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may	203:153,28K  !
2K	always go with one of my daughters.  I am sure your	203:153,29K  !

2S	MY DEAR MADAM,	207:183, 4S  !
2S	I have just had the honour of receiving your letter,	207:183, 5S  !
2S	for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments.	207:183, 6S  !
2S	I am much concerned to find there was any thing in	207:183, 7S  !
2S	my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation;	207:183, 8S  !
2S	and though I am quite at a loss to discover in	207:183, 9S  !
2S	what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you,	207:183,10S  !
2S	I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to	207:183,11S  !
2S	have been perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect	207:183,12S  !
2S	on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire	207:183,13S  !
2S	without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter	207:183,14S  !
2S	myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension	207:183,15S  !
2S	of my actions.  My esteem for your whole	207:183,16S  !
2S	family is very sincere; but if I have been so unfortunate	207:183,17S  !
2S	as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt, or meant	207:183,18S  !
2S	to express, I shall reproach myself for not having been	207:183,19S  !
2S	more guarded in my professions of that esteem.  That	207:183,20S  !
2S	I should ever have meant more you will allow to be	207:183,21S  !
2S	impossible, when you understand that my affections	207:183,22S  !
2S	have been long engaged elsewhere, and it will not be	207:183,23S  !
2S	many weeks, I believe, before this engagement is fulfilled.	207:183,24S  !
2S	It is with great regret that I obey your commands	207:183,25S  !
2S	of returning the letters, with which I have been honoured	207:183,26S  !
2S	from you, and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly	207:183,27S  !

2A	"I can believe it,"	207:188,34A  !

2C	"He \did\ feel the same, Elinor ~ for weeks and weeks	207:188,36C  !
2C	he felt it.  I know he did.  Whatever may have changed	207:188,37C  !
2C	him now, (and nothing but the blackest art employed	207:188,38C  !
2C	against me can have done it,) I was once as dear to him	207:189, 1C  !
2C	as my own soul could wish.  This lock of hair, which	207:189, 2C  !
2C	now he can so readily give up, was begged of me with	207:189, 3C  !
2C	the most earnest supplication.  Had you seen his look,	207:189, 4C  !
2C	his manner, had you heard his voice at that moment|	207:189, 5C  !
2C	Have you forgot the last evening of our being together	207:189, 6C  !
2C	at Barton?  The morning that we parted too|  When	207:189, 7C  !
2C	he told me that it might be many weeks before we meet	207:189, 8C  !
2C	again ~ his distress ~ can I ever forget his distress|"	207:189, 9C  !
2C	"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by	207:189,13C  !

2C	"By all the world, rather than by his own heart.	207:189,17C  !
2C	I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance	207:189,18C  !
2C	leagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe	207:189,19C  !
2C	his nature capable of such cruelty.  This woman of	207:189,20C  !
2C	whom he writes ~ whoever she be ~ or any one, in short,	207:189,21C  !
2C	but your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have	207:189,22C  !

2A	be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister,	207:189,29A  !
2A	by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own	207:189,30A  !
2A	innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.	207:189,31A  !
2A	It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such	207:189,32A  !

2C	"misery such as mine has	207:189,34C  !
2C	no pride.  I care not who knows that I am wretched.	207:189,35C  !
2C	The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the	207:189,36C  !

2C	could this be yours|  Cruel, cruel ~ nothing can acquit	207:190,17C  !

2C	words?  Oh| barbarously insolent| ~ Elinor, can he be	207:190,25C  !
2C	justified?"	207:190,26C  !

2A	"To-morrow, Marianne|"	207:190,38A  !

2C	regards me?"	207:191, 3C  !
2A	"It would be impossible to go to-morrow.  We owe	207:191, 4A  !

2A	the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal	207:191, 6A  !
2A	as that."	207:191, 7A  !
2C	"Well, then, another day or two, perhaps; but	207:191, 8C  !
2C	I cannot stay here long, I cannot stay to endure the	207:191, 9C  !
2C	questions and remarks of all these people.  The Middletons	207:191,10C  !
2C	and Palmers ~ how am I to bear their pity?  The	207:191,11C  !

2K	"How is she, Miss Dashwood? ~ Poor thing|  she	208:192, 8K  !
2K	looks very bad.  ~ No wonder.  Aye, it is but too true.	208:192, 9K  !
2K	He is to be married very soon ~ a good-for-nothing	208:192,10K  !
2K	fellow|  I have no patience with him.  Mrs% Taylor	208:192,11K  !
2K	told me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by	208:192,12K  !
2K	a particular friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure	208:192,13K  !
2K	I should not have believed it; and I was almost ready	208:192,14K  !
2K	to sink as it was.  Well, said I, all I can say is, that	208:192,15K  !
2K	if it is true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance	208:192,16K  !
2K	abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife	208:192,17K  !
2K	may plague his heart out.  And so I shall always say,	208:192,18K  !
2K	my dear, you may depend on it.  I have no notion of	208:192,19K  !
2K	men's going on in this way:  and if ever I meet him	208:192,20K  !
2K	again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had	208:192,21K  !
2K	this many a day.  But there is one comfort, my dear	208:192,22K  !
2K	Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man in the	208:192,23K  !
2K	world worth having; and with your pretty face you	208:192,24K  !
2K	will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing|  I won't	208:192,25K  !
2K	disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry	208:192,26K  !
2K	out at once and have done with it.  The Parrys and	208:192,27K  !
2K	Sandersons luckily are coming to-night you know, and	208:192,28K  !
2K	that will amuse her."	208:192,29K  !
2C	"no, she would go down; she could bear it very	208:193, 1C  !
2C	well, and the bustle about her would be less."	208:193, 2C  !
2C	Misery,	208:193,36C  !
2K	"Poor soul|"	208:194, 1K  !
2K	"how it grieves me to see her|  And I declare	208:194, 2K  !
2K	if she is not gone away without finishing her wine|	208:194, 3K  !
2K	And the dried cherries too|  Lord|  nothing seems to	208:194, 4K  !
2K	do her any good.  I am sure if I knew any thing she	208:194, 5K  !
2K	would like, I would send all over the town for it.  Well,	208:194, 6K  !
2K	it is the oddest thing to me, that a man should use such	208:194, 7K  !
2K	a pretty girl so ill|  But when there is plenty of money	208:194, 8K  !
2K	on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless	208:194, 9K  !
2K	you| they care no more about such things| ~"	208:194,10K  !
2A	"The lady then ~ Miss Grey I think you called her ~	208:194,11A  !
2A	is very rich?"	208:194,12A  !
2K	"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see	208:194,13K  !
2K	her? a smart, stilish girl they say, but not handsome.	208:194,14K  !
2K	I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she	208:194,15K  !
2K	married a very wealthy man.  But the family are all	208:194,16K  !
2K	rich together.  Fifty thousand pounds|  and by all	208:194,17K  !
2K	accounts it wo'nt come before it's wanted; for they	208:194,18K  !
2K	say he is all to pieces.  No wonder| dashing about with	208:194,19K  !
2K	his curricle and hunters|  Well, it don't signify talking,	208:194,20K  !
2K	but when a young man, be he who he will, comes and	208:194,21K  !
2K	makes love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he	208:194,22K  !
2K	has no business to fly off from his word only because	208:194,23K  !
2K	he grows poor, and a richer girl is ready to have him.	208:194,24K  !
2K	Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his	208:194,25K  !
2K	house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform	208:194,26K  !
2K	at once?  I warrant you, Miss Marianne would have	208:194,27K  !
2K	been ready to wait till matters came round.  But that	208:194,28K  !
2K	won't do, now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure	208:194,29K  !
2K	can ever be given up by the young men of this age."	208:194,30K  !
2A	"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?	208:194,31A  !
2A	Is she said to be amiable?"	208:194,32A  !
2K	"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly	208:194,33K  !
2K	ever heard her mentioned; except that Mrs% Taylor did	208:194,34K  !
2K	say this morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to	208:194,35K  !
2K	her, that she believed Mr% and Mrs% Ellison would not	208:194,36K  !
2K	be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs% Ellison	208:194,37K  !
2K	could never agree." ~	208:194,38K  !
2A	"And who are the Ellisons?"	208:195, 1A  !
2K	"Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age	208:195, 2K  !
2K	and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has	208:195, 3K  !
2K	made|  What now,"	208:195, 4K  !
2K	"your	208:195, 4K  !
2K	poor sister is gone to her own room I suppose to moan	208:195, 5K  !
2K	by herself.  Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?	208:195, 6K  !
2K	Poor dear, it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well,	208:195, 7K  !
2K	by-and-by we shall have a few friends, and that will amuse	208:195, 8K  !
2K	her a little.  What shall we play at?  She hates whist	208:195, 9K  !
2K	I know; but is there no round game she cares for?"	208:195,10K  !
2A	"Dear Ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.	208:195,11A  !
2A	Marianne I dare say will not leave her room again this	208:195,12A  !
2A	evening.  I shall persuade her if I can to go early to	208:195,13A  !
2A	bed, for I am sure she wants rest."	208:195,14A  !
2K	"Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her	208:195,15K  !
2K	name her own supper, and go to bed.  Lord| no wonder	208:195,16K  !
2K	she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last	208:195,17K  !
2K	week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging	208:195,18K  !
2K	over her head as long as that.  And so the letter that	208:195,19K  !
2K	came to-day finished it|  Poor soul|  I am sure if I had	208:195,20K  !
2K	had a notion of it, I would not have joked her about	208:195,21K  !
2K	it for all my money.  But then you know, how should	208:195,22K  !
2K	I guess such a thing?  I made sure of its being nothing	208:195,23K  !
2K	but a common love letter, and you know young people	208:195,24K  !
2K	like to be laughed at about them.  Lord|  how concerned	208:195,25K  !
2K	Sir John and my daughters will be when they	208:195,26K  !
2K	hear it|  If I had had my senses about me I might	208:195,27K  !
2K	have called in Conduit-street in my way home, and told	208:195,28K  !
2K	them of it.  But I shall see them to-morrow."	208:195,29K  !
2A	"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to	208:195,30A  !
2A	caution Mrs% Palmer and Sir John against ever naming	208:195,31A  !
2A	Mr% Willoughby, or making the slightest allusion to what	208:195,32A  !
2A	has passed, before my sister.  Their own good-nature	208:195,33A  !
2A	must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing	208:195,34A  !
2A	to know any thing about it when she is present; and	208:195,35A  !
2A	the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject,	208:195,36A  !
2A	the more my feelings will be spared, as you my dear	208:195,37A  !
2A	madam will easily believe."	208:195,38A  !
2K	"Oh|  Lord|  yes, that I do indeed.  It must be	208:196, 1K  !
2K	terrible for you to hear it talked of; and as for your	208:196, 2K  !
2K	sister, I am sure I would not mention a word about it	208:196, 3K  !
2K	to her for the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.	208:196, 4K  !
2K	No more would Sir John nor my daughters, for they are	208:196, 5K  !
2K	all very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give	208:196, 6K  !
2K	them a hint, as I certainly will.  For my part, I think	208:196, 7K  !
2K	the less that is said about such things, the better, the	208:196, 8K  !
2K	sooner 'tis blown over and forgot.  And what good does	208:196, 9K  !
2K	talking ever do you know?"	208:196,10K  !
2A	"In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps	208:196,11A  !
2A	than in many cases of a similar kind, for it has been	208:196,12A  !
2A	attended by circumstances which, for the sake of every one	208:196,13A  !
2A	concerned in it, make it unfit to become the public	208:196,14A  !
2A	conversation.  I must do \this\ justice to Mr% Willoughby	208:196,15A  !
2A	~ he has broken no positive engagement with my sister."	208:196,16A  !
2K	"Law, my dear|  Don't pretend to defend him.  No	208:196,17K  !
2K	positive engagement indeed|  after taking her all over	208:196,18K  !
2K	Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they	208:196,19K  !
2K	were to live in hereafter|"	208:196,20K  !
2K	"Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill wind,	208:196,27K  !
2K	for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon.  He	208:196,28K  !
2K	will have her at last; aye, that he will.  Mind me, now,	208:196,29K  !
2K	if they an't married by Midsummer.  Lord|  how he'll	208:196,30K  !
2K	chuckle over this news|  I hope he will come to-night.	208:196,31K  !
2K	It will be all to one a better match for your sister.  Two	208:196,32K  !
2K	thousand a year without debt or drawback ~ except the	208:196,33K  !
2K	little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her; but	208:196,34K  !
2K	she may be 'prenticed out at small cost, and then what	208:196,35K  !
2K	does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;	208:196,36K  !
2K	exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of	208:196,37K  !
2K	comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great	208:196,38K  !
2K	garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees	208:197, 1K  !
2K	in the country:  and such a mulberry tree in one corner|	208:197, 2K  !
2K	Lord|  how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we	208:197, 3K  !
2K	were there|  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful	208:197, 4K  !
2K	stewponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,	208:197, 5K  !
2K	in short, that one could wish for:  and, moreover, it is	208:197, 6K  !
2K	close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from	208:197, 7K  !
2K	the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go	208:197, 8K  !
2K	and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you	208:197, 9K  !
2K	may see all the carriages that pass along.  Oh|  'tis	208:197,10K  !
2K	a nice place|  A butcher hard by in the village, and	208:197,11K  !
2K	the parsonage-house within a stone's throw.  To my	208:197,12K  !
2K	fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park,	208:197,13K  !
2K	where they are forced to send three miles for their meat,	208:197,14K  !
2K	and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother.	208:197,15K  !
2K	Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.	208:197,16K  !
2K	One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.	208:197,17K  !
2K	If we \can\ but put Willoughby out of her head|"	208:197,18K  !
2A	"Aye, if we can but do \that\, Ma'am,"	208:197,19A  !
2A	"we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon."	208:197,20A  !
2C	"You had better leave me,"	208:197,25C  !
2A	"I will leave you,"	208:197,27A  !

2A	bed."	208:197,28A  !
2K	"My dear,"	208:197,37K  !
2K	"I have just recollected	208:197,37K  !

2K	a glass of it for your sister.  My poor husband| how	208:198, 2K  !
2K	fond he was of it|  Whenever he had a touch of his	208:198, 3K  !
2K	old cholicky gout, he said it did him more good than	208:198, 4K  !

2A	"how good you are|  But I have just left Marianne in	208:198, 8A  !
2A	bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think nothing	208:198, 9A  !
2A	will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will	208:198,10A  !
2A	give me leave, I will drink the wine myself."	208:198,11A  !
2K	"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you	208:198,27K  !

2A	"Marianne is not well,"	208:198,32A  !
2A	"She has been	208:198,32A  !
2A	indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go	208:198,33A  !
2A	to bed."	208:198,34A  !
2H	"Perhaps, then,"	208:198,35H  !
2H	"what I	208:198,35H  !
2H	heard this morning may be ~ there may be more truth	208:198,36H  !
2H	in it than I could believe possible at first."	208:198,37H  !
2A	"What did you hear?"	208:198,38A  !
2H	"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think ~ in	208:199, 1H  !
2H	short, that a man, whom I \knew\ to be engaged ~ but	208:199, 2H  !
2H	how shall I tell you?  If you know it already, as surely	208:199, 3H  !
2H	you must, I may be spared."	208:199, 4H  !
2A	"You mean,"	208:199, 5A  !
2A	"Mr% Willoughby's marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we	208:199, 6A  !
2A	\do\ know it all.  This seems to have been a day of general	208:199, 7A  !
2A	elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to	208:199, 8A  !
2A	us.  Mr% Willoughby is unfathomable|  Where did you	208:199, 9A  !
2A	hear it?"	208:199,10A  !
2H	"In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had	208:199,11H  !
2H	business.  Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,	208:199,12H  !
2H	and one of them was giving the other an account of the	208:199,13H  !
2H	intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,	208:199,14H  !
2H	that it was impossible for me not to hear all.	208:199,15H  !
2H	The name of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently	208:199,16H  !
2H	repeated, first caught my attention, and what followed	208:199,17H  !
2H	was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally	208:199,18H  !
2H	settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey ~ it was	208:199,19H  !
2H	no longer to be a secret ~ it would take place even within	208:199,20H  !
2H	a few weeks, with many particulars of preparations and	208:199,21H  !
2H	other matters.  One thing, especially, I remember,	208:199,22H  !
2H	because it served to identify the man still more: ~ as	208:199,23H  !
2H	soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to	208:199,24H  !
2H	Combe Magna, his seat in Somersetshire.  My astonishment| ~	208:199,25H  !
2H	but it would be impossible to describe what	208:199,26H  !
2H	I felt.  The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry,	208:199,27H  !
2H	for I staid in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs% Ellison,	208:199,28H  !
2H	and that, as I have been since informed, is the	208:199,29H  !
2H	name of Miss Grey's guardian."	208:199,30H  !
2A	"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey	208:199,31A  !
2A	has fifty thousand pounds?  In that, if in any thing,	208:199,32A  !
2A	we may find an explanation."	208:199,33A  !
2H	"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable ~ at least	208:199,34H  !
2H	I think" ~	208:199,35H  !
2H	"And your sister ~ how	208:199,36H  !
2H	did she ~"	208:199,37H  !
2A	"Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have only	208:199,38A  !
2A	to hope that they may be proportionably short.  It has	208:200, 1A  !
2A	been, it is a most cruel affliction.  Till yesterday, I	208:200, 2A  !
2A	believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,	208:200, 3A  !
2A	perhaps ~ But \I\ am almost convinced that he never was	208:200, 4A  !
2A	really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful|	208:200, 5A  !
2A	and, in some points, there seems a hardness of heart	208:200, 6A  !
2A	about him."	208:200, 7A  !
2H	"Ah|"	208:200, 8H  !
2H	"there is, indeed|	208:200, 8H  !
2H	But your sister does not ~ I think you said so ~ she does	208:200, 9H  !
2H	not consider it quite as you do?"	208:200,10H  !
2A	"You know her disposition, and may believe how	208:200,11A  !
2A	eagerly she would still justify him if she could."	208:200,12A  !
2C	"No, no, no, it cannot be,"	209:201,22C  !
2C	"she cannot	209:201,22C  !
2C	feel.  Her kindness is not sympathy; her good nature	209:201,23C  !
2C	is not tenderness.  All that she wants is gossip, and she	209:201,24C  !
2C	only likes me now because I supply it."	209:201,25C  !
2K	"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am	209:202,14K  !
2K	sure will do you good."	209:202,15K  !
2A	"Who can this be?"	209:203,34A  !
2A	"So early too|	209:203,34A  !
2A	I thought we \had\ been safe."	209:203,35A  !
2C	"It is Colonel Brandon|"	209:203,37C  !
2C	"We are never safe from \him\."	209:203,38C  !
2A	"He will not come in, as Mrs% Jennings is from home."	209:204, 1A  !
2C	"I will not trust to \that\,"	209:204, 2C  !
2C	"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has	209:204, 3C  !
2C	no conscience in his intrusion on that of others."	209:204, 4C  !
2H	"I met Mrs% Jennings in Bond-street,"	209:204,12H  !
2H	"and she encouraged me to come	209:204,13H  !
2H	on; and I was the more easily encouraged, because	209:204,14H  !
2H	I thought it probable that I might find you alone, which	209:204,15H  !
2H	I was very desirous of doing.  My object ~ my wish ~	209:204,16H  !
2H	my sole wish in desiring it ~ I hope, I believe it is ~ is	209:204,17H  !
2H	to be a means of giving comfort; ~ no, I must not say	209:204,18H  !
2H	comfort ~ not present comfort ~ but conviction, lasting	209:204,19H  !
2H	conviction to your sister's mind.  My regard for her, for	209:204,20H  !
2H	yourself, for your mother ~ will you allow me to prove	209:204,21H  !
2H	it, by relating some circumstances, which nothing but	209:204,22H  !
2H	a \very\ sincere regard ~ nothing but an earnest desire of	209:204,23H  !
2H	being useful ~~ I think I am justified ~ though where	209:204,24H  !
2H	so many hours have been spent in convincing myself	209:204,25H  !
2H	that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may	209:204,26H  !
2H	be wrong?"	209:204,27H  !
2A	"I understand you,"	209:204,28A  !
2A	"You have something	209:204,28A  !
2A	to tell me of Mr% Willoughby, that will open his	209:204,29A  !
2A	character farther.  Your telling it will be the greatest	209:204,30A  !
2A	act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne.  \My\	209:204,31A  !
2A	gratitude will be insured immediately by any information	209:204,32A  !
2A	tending to that end, and \her's\ must be gained by	209:204,33A  !
2A	it in time.  Pray, pray let me hear it."	209:204,34A  !
2H	"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton	209:204,35H  !
2H	last October, ~ but this will give you no idea ~ I must	209:204,36H  !
2H	go farther back.  You will find me a very awkward	209:204,37H  !
2H	narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to	209:204,38H  !
2H	begin.  A short account of myself, I believe, will be	209:205, 1H  !
2H	necessary, and it \shall\ be a short one.  On such a subject,"	209:205, 2H  !
2H	"I can have little temptation to	209:205, 3H  !
2H	be diffuse."	209:205, 4H  !
2H	"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation ~	209:205, 7H  !
2H	(it is not to be supposed that it could make any	209:205, 8H  !
2H	impression on you) ~ a conversation between us one	209:205, 9H  !
2H	evening at Barton Park ~ it was the evening of a dance ~	209:205,10H  !
2H	in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as	209:205,11H  !
2H	resembling, in some measure, your sister Marianne."	209:205,12H  !
2A	"Indeed,"	209:205,13A  !
2A	"I have \not\ forgotten	209:205,13A  !
2A	it."	209:205,14A  !
2H	"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality	209:205,15H  !
2H	of tender recollection, there is a very strong	209:205,16H  !
2H	resemblance between them, as well in mind as person.	209:205,17H  !
2H	The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy	209:205,18H  !
2H	and spirits.  This lady was one of my nearest relations,	209:205,19H  !
2H	an orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship	209:205,20H  !
2H	of my father.  Our ages were nearly the same, and from	209:205,21H  !
2H	our earliest years we were playfellows and friends.	209:205,22H  !
2H	I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza;	209:205,23H  !
2H	and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as	209:205,24H  !
2H	perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless	209:205,25H  !
2H	gravity, you might think me incapable of having ever	209:205,26H  !
2H	felt.  Her's, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the attachment	209:205,27H  !
2H	of your sister to Mr% Willoughby, and it was,	209:205,28H  !
2H	though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.  At	209:205,29H  !
2H	seventeen, she was lost to me for ever.  She was married	209:205,30H  !
2H	~ married against her inclination to my brother.  Her	209:205,31H  !
2H	fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.	209:205,32H  !
2H	And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the	209:205,33H  !
2H	conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.	209:205,34H  !
2H	My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love	209:205,35H  !
2H	her.  I had hoped that her regard for me would support	209:205,36H  !
2H	her under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but	209:205,37H  !
2H	at last the misery of her situation, for she experienced	209:205,38H  !
2H	great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and	209:206, 1H  !
2H	though she had promised me that nothing ~~ but how	209:206, 2H  !
2H	blindly I relate|  I have never told you how this was	209:206, 3H  !
2H	brought on.  We were within a few hours of eloping	209:206, 4H  !
2H	together for Scotland.  The treachery, or the folly, of	209:206, 5H  !
2H	my cousin's maid betrayed us.  I was banished to the	209:206, 6H  !
2H	house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no	209:206, 7H  !
2H	liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father's point	209:206, 8H  !
2H	was gained.  I had depended on her fortitude too far,	209:206, 9H  !
2H	and the blow was a severe one ~ but had her marriage	209:206,10H  !
2H	been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must	209:206,11H  !
2H	have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have	209:206,12H  !
2H	now to lament it.  This however was not the case.  My	209:206,13H  !
2H	brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not	209:206,14H  !
2H	what they ought to have been, and from the first he	209:206,15H  !
2H	treated her unkindly.  The consequence of this, upon	209:206,16H  !
2H	a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs% Brandon's,	209:206,17H  !
2H	was but too natural.  She resigned herself	209:206,18H  !
2H	at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy	209:206,19H  !
2H	had it been if she had not lived to overcome those	209:206,20H  !
2H	regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.  But	209:206,21H  !
2H	can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke	209:206,22H  !
2H	inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain	209:206,23H  !
2H	her, (for my father lived only a few months after their	209:206,24H  !
2H	marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies)	209:206,25H  !
2H	she should fall?  Had I remained in England,	209:206,26H  !
2H	perhaps ~ but I meant to promote the happiness of both	209:206,27H  !
2H	by removing from her for years, and for that purpose	209:206,28H  !
2H	had procured my exchange.  The shock which her	209:206,29H  !
2H	marriage had given me,"	209:206,30H  !
2H	"was of trifling weight ~ was nothing ~	209:206,31H  !
2H	to what I felt when I heard, about two years afterwards,	209:206,32H  !
2H	of her divorce.  It was \that\ which threw this gloom, ~	209:206,33H  !
2H	even now the recollection of what I suffered ~"	209:206,34H  !
2H	"It was nearly three years after this unhappy period	209:207, 4H  !
2H	before I returned to England.  My first care, when I \did\	209:207, 5H  !
2H	arrive, was of course to seek for her; but the search	209:207, 6H  !
2H	was as fruitless as it was melancholy.  I could not trace	209:207, 7H  !
2H	her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason	209:207, 8H  !
2H	to fear that she had removed from him only to sink	209:207, 9H  !
2H	deeper in a life of sin.  Her legal allowance was not	209:207,10H  !
2H	adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her comfortable	209:207,11H  !
2H	maintenance, and I learnt from my brother, that	209:207,12H  !
2H	the power of receiving it had been made over some	209:207,13H  !
2H	months before to another person.  He imagined, and	209:207,14H  !
2H	calmly could he imagine it, that her extravagance and	209:207,15H  !
2H	consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for	209:207,16H  !
2H	some immediate relief.  At last, however, and after I had	209:207,17H  !
2H	been six months in England, I \did\ find her.  Regard for	209:207,18H  !
2H	a former servant of my own, who had since fallen into	209:207,19H  !
2H	misfortune, carried me to visit him in a spunging-house,	209:207,20H  !
2H	where he was confined for debt; and there, in the same	209:207,21H  !
2H	house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate	209:207,22H  !
2H	sister.  So altered ~ so faded ~ worn down by acute	209:207,23H  !
2H	suffering of every kind|  hardly could I believe the	209:207,24H  !
2H	melancholy and sickly figure before me, to be the remains	209:207,25H  !
2H	of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom I had	209:207,26H  !
2H	once doated.  What I endured in so beholding her ~ but	209:207,27H  !
2H	I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting	209:207,28H  !
2H	to describe it ~ I have pained you too much already.	209:207,29H  !
2H	That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage of	209:207,30H  !
2H	a consumption, was ~ yes, in such a situation it was my	209:207,31H  !
2H	greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her, beyond	209:207,32H  !
2H	giving time for a better preparation for death; and that	209:207,33H  !
2H	was given.  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,	209:207,34H  !
2H	and under proper attendants; I visited her every day	209:207,35H  !
2H	during the rest of her short life; I was with her in her	209:207,36H  !
2H	last moments."	209:207,37H  !
2H	"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,"	209:208, 3H  !
2H	"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and	209:208, 4H  !
2H	my poor disgraced relation.  Their fates, their fortunes	209:208, 5H  !
2H	cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet disposition	209:208, 6H  !
2H	of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or	209:208, 7H  !
2H	an happier marriage, she might have been all that you	209:208, 8H  !
2H	will live to see the other be.  But to what does all this	209:208, 9H  !
2H	lead?  I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.	209:208,10H  !
2H	Ah|  Miss Dashwood ~ a subject such as this ~ untouched	209:208,11H  !
2H	for fourteen years ~ it is dangerous to handle it at all|	209:208,12H  !
2H	I \will\ be more collected ~ more concise.  She left to my	209:208,13H  !
2H	care her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first	209:208,14H  !
2H	guilty connection, who was then about three years old.	209:208,15H  !
2H	She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.	209:208,16H  !
2H	It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly	209:208,17H  !
2H	would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by	209:208,18H  !
2H	watching over her education myself, had the nature of	209:208,19H  !
2H	our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no	209:208,20H  !
2H	home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at	209:208,21H  !
2H	school.  I saw her there whenever I could, and after	209:208,22H  !
2H	the death of my brother, (which happened about five	209:208,23H  !
2H	years ago, and which left to me the possession of the	209:208,24H  !
2H	family property,) she frequently visited me at Delaford.	209:208,25H  !
2H	I called her a distant relation; but I am well aware	209:208,26H  !
2H	that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer	209:208,27H  !
2H	connection with her.  It is now three years ago, (she	209:208,28H  !
2H	had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I removed	209:208,29H  !
2H	her from school, to place her under the care of a very	209:208,30H  !
2H	respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the	209:208,31H  !
2H	charge of four or five other girls of about the same time	209:208,32H  !
2H	of life; and for two years I had every reason to be	209:208,33H  !
2H	pleased with her situation.  But last February, almost	209:208,34H  !
2H	a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.  I had	209:208,35H  !
2H	allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,)	209:208,36H  !
2H	at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her	209:208,37H  !
2H	young friends, who was attending her father there for	209:208,38H  !
2H	his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,	209:209, 1H  !
2H	and I thought well of his daughter ~ better than she	209:209, 2H  !
2H	deserved, for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged	209:209, 3H  !
2H	secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue,	209:209, 4H  !
2H	though she certainly knew all.  He, her father, a well-meaning,	209:209, 5H  !
2H	but not a quick-sighted man, could really,	209:209, 6H  !
2H	I believe, give no information; for he had been generally	209:209, 7H  !
2H	confined to the house, while the girls were ranging over	209:209, 8H  !
2H	the town and making what acquaintance they chose;	209:209, 9H  !
2H	and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was	209:209,10H  !
2H	convinced himself, of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned	209:209,11H  !
2H	in the business.  In short, I could learn nothing	209:209,12H  !
2H	but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight long	209:209,13H  !
2H	months, was left to conjecture.  What I thought, what	209:209,14H  !
2H	I feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too."	209:209,15H  !
2A	"Good heavens|"	209:209,16A  !
2A	"could it be ~ could	209:209,16A  !
2A	Willoughby| ~	209:209,17A  !
2H	"The first news that reached me of her,"	209:209,18H  !
2H	"came in a letter from herself, last October.  It was	209:209,19H  !
2H	forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it on	209:209,20H  !
2H	the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;	209:209,21H  !
2H	and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,	209:209,22H  !
2H	which I am sure must at the time have appeared	209:209,23H  !
2H	strange to every body, and which I believe gave offence	209:209,24H  !
2H	to some.  Little did Mr% Willoughby imagine, I suppose,	209:209,25H  !
2H	when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up	209:209,26H  !
2H	the party, that I was called away to the relief of one,	209:209,27H  !
2H	whom he had made poor and miserable; but \had\ he	209:209,28H  !
2H	known it, what would it have availed?  Would he have	209:209,29H  !
2H	been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?	209:209,30H  !
2H	No, he had already done that, which no man who \can\	209:209,31H  !
2H	feel for another, would do.  He had left the girl whose	209:209,32H  !
2H	youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of	209:209,33H  !
2H	the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,	209:209,34H  !
2H	no friends, ignorant of his address|  He had left her	209:209,35H  !
2H	promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote,	209:209,36H  !
2H	nor relieved her."	209:209,37H  !
2A	"This is beyond every thing|"	209:209,38A  !
2H	"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated,	209:210, 1H  !
2H	and worse than both.  Knowing all this, as	209:210, 2H  !
2H	I have now known it many weeks, guess what I must	209:210, 3H  !
2H	have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever,	209:210, 4H  !
2H	and on being assured that she was to marry him; guess	209:210, 5H  !
2H	what I must have felt for all your sakes.  When I came	209:210, 6H  !
2H	to you last week and found you alone, I came determined	209:210, 7H  !
2H	to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when	209:210, 8H  !
2H	it \was\ known.  My behaviour must have seemed strange	209:210, 9H  !
2H	to you then; but now you will comprehend it.  To	209:210,10H  !
2H	suffer you all to be so deceived; to see your sister ~ but	209:210,11H  !
2H	what could I do?  I had no hope of interfering with	209:210,12H  !
2H	success; and sometimes I thought your sister's influence	209:210,13H  !
2H	might yet reclaim him.  But now, after such dishonourable	209:210,14H  !
2H	usage, who can tell what were his designs on her?	209:210,15H  !
2H	Whatever they may have been, however, she may now,	209:210,16H  !
2H	and hereafter doubtless \will\, turn with gratitude towards	209:210,17H  !
2H	her own condition, when she compares it with that of	209:210,18H  !
2H	my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and	209:210,19H  !
2H	hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to	209:210,20H  !
2H	herself, with an affection for him as strong, still as strong	209:210,21H  !
2H	as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach,	209:210,22H  !
2H	which must attend her through life.  Surely this comparison	209:210,23H  !
2H	must have its use with her.  She will feel her	209:210,24H  !
2H	own sufferings to be nothing.  They proceed from no	209:210,25H  !
2H	misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.  On the contrary,	209:210,26H  !
2H	every friend must be made still more her friend by	209:210,27H  !
2H	them.  Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her	209:210,28H  !
2H	fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment.	209:210,29H  !
2H	Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to	209:210,30H  !
2H	her what I have told you.  You must know best what	209:210,31H  !
2H	will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my	209:210,32H  !
2H	heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her	209:210,33H  !
2H	regrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you	209:210,34H  !
2H	with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital	209:210,35H  !
2H	which may seem to have been intended to raise myself	209:210,36H  !
2H	at the expense of others."	209:210,37H  !
2A	"I have been more pained,"	209:211, 4A  !
2A	"by her	209:211, 4A  !
2A	endeavours to acquit him than by all the rest; for it	209:211, 5A  !
2A	irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction	209:211, 6A  !
2A	of his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first she	209:211, 7A  !
2A	will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.	209:211, 8A  !

2H	her lover; and when he returned to town, which was	209:211,18H  !
2H	within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment,	209:211,19H  !
2H	he to defend, I to punish his conduct.  We returned	209:211,20H  !

2F	half hour, but one has always so much to do on first	211:222, 2F  !
2F	coming to town.  I am come here to bespeak Fanny	211:222, 3F  !

2F	every civility, and accommodation that can serve to	211:222,18F  !

2F	your little cottage and want for nothing|  Edward	211:222,21F  !
2F	brought us a most charming account of the place; the	211:222,22F  !
2F	most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was,	211:222,23F  !
2F	and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing.  It	211:222,24F  !

2F	much, for your sake."	211:223,28F  !

2F	the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back;	211:223,35F  !
2F	his friends may all advise him against it.  But some of	211:223,36F  !
2F	those little attentions and encouragements which ladies	211:223,37F  !

2F	there can be no reason why you should not try for him.	211:224, 1F  !
2F	It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on	211:224, 2F  !
2F	your side ~ in short, you know as to an attachment of	211:224, 3F  !

2F	mother too, Mrs% Ferrars, a very good-natured woman,	211:224,16F  !

2F	"It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in	211:224,26F  !
2F	agitation.  He has a most excellent mother.  Mrs% Ferrars,	211:224,27F  !
2F	with the utmost liberality, will come forward, and settle	211:224,28F  !
2F	on him a thousand a-year, if the match takes place.	211:224,29F  !
2F	The lady is the Hon% Miss Morton, only daughter of the	211:224,30F  !

2F	desirable connection on both sides, and I have not	211:224,32F  !
2F	a doubt of its taking place in time.  A thousand a-year	211:224,33F  !

2F	you another instance of her liberality: ~ The other day,	211:224,36F  !
2F	as soon as we came to town, aware that money could	211:224,37F  !
2F	not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes	211:224,38F  !
2F	into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred	211:225, 1F  !
2F	pounds.  And extremely acceptable it is, for we must	211:225, 2F  !
2F	live at a great expense while we are here."	211:225, 3F  !
2A	"Your expenses both in town and country must	211:225, 6A  !
2A	certainly be considerable, but your income is a large one."	211:225, 7A  !
2F	"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.	211:225, 8F  !
2F	I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly	211:225, 9F  !
2F	a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better.	211:225,10F  !
2F	The inclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is	211:225,11F  !
2F	a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little	211:225,12F  !
2F	purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm,	211:225,13F  !
2F	you must remember the place, where old Gibson used	211:225,14F  !
2F	to live.  The land was so very desirable for me in every	211:225,15F  !
2F	respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that	211:225,16F  !
2F	I felt it my duty to buy it.  I could not have answered	211:225,17F  !
2F	it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands.	211:225,18F  !
2F	A man must pay for his convenience; and it \has\ cost	211:225,19F  !
2F	me a vast deal of money."	211:225,20F  !
2A	"More than you think it really and intrinsically	211:225,21A  !
2A	worth."	211:225,22A  !
2F	"Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again	211:225,23F  !
2F	the next day, for more than I gave:  but with regard	211:225,24F  !
2F	to the purchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate	211:225,25F  !
2F	indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,	211:225,26F  !
2F	that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum	211:225,27F  !
2F	in my banker's hands, I must have sold out to very	211:225,28F  !
2F	great loss."	211:225,29F  !
2F	"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have	211:225,31F  !
2F	had on first coming to Norland.  Our respected father,	211:225,32F  !
2F	as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects	211:225,33F  !
2F	that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)	211:225,34F  !
2F	to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his	211:225,35F  !
2F	doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his	211:225,36F  !
2F	own property as he chose.  But, in consequence of it,	211:225,37F  !
2F	we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,	211:225,38F  !
2F	china, &c% to supply the place of what was taken away.	211:226, 1F  !
2F	You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far	211:226, 2F  !
2F	we must be from being rich, and how acceptable	211:226, 3F  !
2F	Mrs% Ferrars's kindness is."	211:226, 4F  !
2A	"Certainly,"	211:226, 5A  !
2A	"and assisted by her	211:226, 5A  !
2A	liberality, I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances."	211:226, 6A  !
2F	"Another year or two may do much towards it,"	211:226, 8F  !
2F	"but however there is still a great	211:226, 9F  !
2F	deal to be done.  There is not a stone laid of Fanny's	211:226,10F  !
2F	greenhouse, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden	211:226,11F  !
2F	marked out."	211:226,12F  !
2A	"Where is the green-house to be?"	211:226,13A  !
2F	"Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old walnut	211:226,14F  !
2F	trees are all come down to make room for it.  It will	211:226,15F  !
2F	be a very fine object from many parts of the park, and	211:226,16F  !
2F	the flower-garden will slope down just before it, and be	211:226,17F  !
2F	exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old	211:226,18F  !
2F	thorns that grew in patches over the brow."	211:226,19F  !
2F	"She seems a most valuable woman indeed. ~ Her	211:226,28F  !
2F	house, her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good	211:226,29F  !
2F	income; and it is an acquaintance that has not only	211:226,30F  !
2F	been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may	211:226,31F  !
2F	prove materially advantageous. ~ Her inviting you to	211:226,32F  !
2F	town is certainly a vast thing in your favour; and	211:226,33F  !
2F	indeed, it speaks altogether so great a regard for you,	211:226,34F  !
2F	that in all probability when she dies you will not be	211:226,35F  !
2F	forgotten. ~ She must have a great deal to leave."	211:226,36F  !
2A	"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she	211:226,37A  !
2A	has only her jointure, which will descend to her children."	211:226,38A  !
2F	"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her	211:227, 1F  !
2F	income.  Few people of common prudence will do \that\;	211:227, 2F  !
2F	and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of."	211:227, 3F  !
2A	"And do you not think it more likely that she should	211:227, 4A  !
2A	leave it to her daughters, than to us?"	211:227, 5A  !
2F	"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married,	211:227, 6F  !
2F	and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her	211:227, 7F  !
2F	remembering them farther.  Whereas, in my opinion,	211:227, 8F  !
2F	by her taking so much notice of you, and treating you	211:227, 9F  !
2F	in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim	211:227,10F  !
2F	on her future consideration, which a conscientious	211:227,11F  !
2F	woman would not disregard.  Nothing can be kinder	211:227,12F  !
2F	than her behaviour; and she can hardly do all this,	211:227,13F  !
2F	without being aware of the expectation she raises."	211:227,14F  !
2A	"But she raises none in those most concerned.	211:227,15A  !
2A	Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and	211:227,16A  !
2A	prosperity carries you too far."	211:227,17A  !
2F	"Why to be sure,"	211:227,18F  !
2F	"people have little, have very little in their	211:227,19F  !
2F	power.  But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with	211:227,20F  !
2F	Marianne? ~ she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,	211:227,21F  !
2F	and is grown quite thin.  Is she ill?"	211:227,22F  !
2A	"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint	211:227,23A  !
2A	on her for several weeks."	211:227,24A  !
2F	"I am sorry for that.  At her time of life, any thing	211:227,25F  !
2F	of an illness destroys the bloom for ever|  Her's has	211:227,26F  !
2F	been a very short one|  She was as handsome a girl	211:227,27F  !
2F	last September, as any I ever saw; and as likely to	211:227,28F  !
2F	attract the men.  There was something in her style of	211:227,29F  !
2F	beauty, to please them particularly.  I remember Fanny	211:227,30F  !
2F	used to say that she would marry sooner and better	211:227,31F  !
2F	than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of	211:227,32F  !
2F	\you\, but so it happened to strike her.  She will be	211:227,33F  !
2F	mistaken, however.  I question whether Marianne \now\,	211:227,34F  !
2F	will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred	211:227,35F  !
2F	a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if	211:227,36F  !
2F	\you\ do not do better.  Dorsetshire|  I know very little of	211:227,37F  !
2F	Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly	211:227,38F  !
2F	glad to know more of it; and I think I can answer	211:228, 1F  !
2F	for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest	211:228, 2F  !

2F	a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.	211:228,27F  !
2F	And Mrs% Jennings too, an exceeding well-behaved	211:228,28F  !
2F	woman, though not so elegant as her daughter.  Your	211:228,29F  !
2F	sister need not have any scruple even of visiting \her\,	211:228,30F  !
2F	which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and	211:228,31F  !
2F	very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs% Jennings	211:228,32F  !
2F	was the widow of a man who had got all his money in	211:228,33F  !
2F	a low way; and Fanny and Mrs% Ferrars were both	211:228,34F  !
2F	strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughters	211:228,35F  !
2F	were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate	211:228,36F  !

2K	a fuss about the child.  She was sure it was very ill ~ it	301:257,20K  !
2K	cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.  So I looked	301:257,21K  !
2K	at it directly, and, ""Lord| my dear,"" says I, ""it is nothing	301:257,22K  !
2K	in the world but the red-gum;"" and nurse said just	301:257,23K  !
2K	the same.  But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so	301:257,24K  !
2K	Mr% Donavan was sent for; and luckily he happened to	301:257,25K  !
2K	be just come in from Harley-street, so he stepped over	301:257,26K  !
2K	directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said just	301:257,27K  !
2K	as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red-gum,	301:257,28K  !
2K	and then Charlotte was easy.  And so, just as he	301:257,29K  !
2K	was going away again, it came into my head, I am sure	301:257,30K  !
2K	I do not know how I happened to think of it, but it came	301:258, 1K  !
2K	into my head to ask him if there was any news.  So	301:258, 2K  !
2K	upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,	301:258, 3K  !
2K	and seemed to know something or other, and at last he	301:258, 4K  !
2K	said in a whisper,	301:258, 5K  !
2A	"What| is Fanny ill?"	301:258,10A  !
2K	"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  ""Lord|""	301:258,11K  !
2K	says I, ""is Mrs% Dashwood ill?""  So then it all came out;	301:258,12K  !
2K	and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can	301:258,13K  !
2K	learn, seems to be this.  Mr% Edward Ferrars, the very	301:258,14K  !
2K	young man I used to joke with you about (but however,	301:258,15K  !
2K	as it turns out, I am monstrous glad there never was any	301:258,16K  !
2K	thing in it), Mr% Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been	301:258,17K  !
2K	engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy| ~	301:258,18K  !
2K	There's for you, my dear| ~ And not a creature knowing	301:258,19K  !
2K	a syllable of the matter except Nancy| ~ Could you have	301:258,20K  !
2K	believed such a thing possible? ~ There is no great	301:258,21K  !
2K	wonder in their liking one another; but that matters	301:258,22K  !
2K	should be brought so forward between them, and nobody	301:258,23K  !
2K	suspect it|  \That\ is strange| ~ I never happened to see them	301:258,24K  !
2K	together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly.	301:258,25K  !
2K	Well, and so this was kept a great secret, for fear of	301:258,26K  !
2K	Mrs% Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother or sister	301:258,27K  !
2K	suspected a word of the matter; ~ till this very morning,	301:258,28K  !
2K	poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature,	301:258,29K  !
2K	but no conjurer, popt it all out.  ""Lord|"" thinks she to	301:258,30K  !
2K	herself, ""they are all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will	301:258,31K  !
2K	make no difficulty about it;"" and so, away she went to	301:258,32K  !
2K	your sister, who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work,	301:258,33K  !
2K	little suspecting what was to come ~ for she had just been	301:258,34K  !
2K	saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that	301:258,35K  !
2K	she thought to make a match between Edward and some	301:258,36K  !
2K	Lord's daughter or other, I forget who.  So you may	301:258,37K  !
2K	think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride.	301:258,38K  !
2K	She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such	301:259, 1K  !
2K	screams as reached your brother's ears, as he was sitting	301:259, 2K  !
2K	in his own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about	301:259, 3K  !
2K	writing a letter to his steward in the country.  So up he	301:259, 4K  !
2K	flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy was	301:259, 5K  !
2K	come to them by that time, little dreaming what was	301:259, 6K  !
2K	going on.  Poor soul|  I pity \her\.  And I must say, I	301:259, 7K  !
2K	think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded	301:259, 8K  !
2K	like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.	301:259, 9K  !
2K	Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and	301:259,10K  !
2K	your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did	301:259,11K  !
2K	not know what to do.  Mrs% Dashwood declared they	301:259,12K  !
2K	should not stay a minute longer in the house, and your	301:259,13K  !
2K	brother was forced to go down upon \his\ knees too, to	301:259,14K  !
2K	persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up	301:259,15K  !
2K	their clothes.  \Then\ she fell into hysterics again, and he	301:259,16K  !
2K	was so frightened that he would send for Mr% Donavan,	301:259,17K  !
2K	and Mr% Donavan found the house in all this uproar.	301:259,18K  !
2K	The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor	301:259,19K  !
2K	cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came	301:259,20K  !
2K	off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could	301:259,21K  !
2K	hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.  I	301:259,22K  !
2K	declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,	301:259,23K  !
2K	with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.	301:259,24K  !
2K	Lord| what a taking poor Mr% Edward will be in when	301:259,25K  !
2K	he hears of it|  To have his love used so scornfully| for	301:259,26K  !
2K	they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.	301:259,27K  !
2K	I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest of	301:259,28K  !
2K	a passion| ~ and Mr% Donavan thinks just the same.  He	301:259,29K  !
2K	and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of	301:259,30K  !
2K	all is, that he is gone back again to Harley-street, that	301:259,31K  !
2K	he may be within call when Mrs% Ferrars is told of it, for	301:259,32K  !
2K	she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,	301:259,33K  !
2K	for your sister was sure \she\ would be in hysterics too;	301:259,34K  !
2K	and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for either	301:259,35K  !
2K	of them.  I have no notion of people's making such	301:259,36K  !
2K	a to-do about money and greatness.  There is no reason	301:259,37K  !
2K	on earth why Mr% Edward and Lucy should not marry;	301:259,38K  !
2K	for I am sure Mrs% Ferrars may afford to do very well by	301:260, 1K  !
2K	her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,	301:260, 2K  !
2K	she knows better than any body how to make the most	301:260, 3K  !
2K	of every thing; and I dare say, if Mrs% Ferrars would only	301:260, 4K  !
2K	allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good	301:260, 5K  !
2K	an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.	301:260, 6K  !
2K	Lord| how snug they might live in such another cottage	301:260, 7K  !
2K	as yours ~ or a little bigger ~ with two maids and two	301:260, 8K  !
2K	men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid,	301:260, 9K  !
2K	for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit	301:260,10K  !
2K	them exactly."	301:260,11K  !
2C	"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has	301:262, 9C  !
2C	he written to you?"	301:262,10C  !
2A	"I have known it these four months.  When Lucy first	301:262,11A  !
2A	came to Barton-park last November, she told me in	301:262,12A  !
2A	confidence of her engagement."	301:262,13A  !
2C	"Four months| ~ Have you known of this four	301:262,17C  !
2C	months?" ~	301:262,18C  !
2C	"What| ~ while attending me in all my misery, has	301:262,20C  !
2C	this been on your heart? ~ and I have reproached you	301:262,21C  !
2C	for being happy|" ~	301:262,22C  !
2A	"It was not fit that you should then know how much	301:262,23A  !
2A	I was the reverse|" ~	301:262,24A  !
2C	"Four months|" ~	301:262,25C  !
2C	"So calm|	301:262,25C  !
2C	~ so cheerful| ~ how have you been supported?" ~	301:262,26C  !
2A	"By feeling that I was doing my duty. ~ My promise	301:262,27A  !
2A	to Lucy, obliged me to be secret.  I owed it to her,	301:262,28A  !
2A	therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and	301:262,29A  !
2A	I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them	301:262,30A  !
2A	a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power	301:262,31A  !
2A	to satisfy."	301:262,32A  !
2A	"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and	301:262,34A  !
2A	my mother,"	301:262,35A  !
2A	"and once or twice I have	301:262,35A  !
2A	attempted it; ~ but without betraying my trust, I never	301:262,36A  !
2A	could have convinced you."	301:262,37A  !
2C	"Four months| ~ and yet you loved him|" ~	301:262,38C  !
2A	"Yes.  But I did not love only him; ~ and while the	301:263, 1A  !
2A	comfort of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare	301:263, 2A  !
2A	them from knowing how much I felt.  Now, I can think	301:263, 3A  !
2A	and speak of it with little emotion.  I would not have	301:263, 4A  !
2A	you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no	301:263, 5A  !
2A	longer suffer materially myself.  I have many things to	301:263, 6A  !
2A	support me.  I am not conscious of having provoked the	301:263, 7A  !
2A	disappointment by any imprudence of my own, and I	301:263, 8A  !
2A	have borne it as much as possible without spreading it	301:263, 9A  !
2A	farther.  I acquit Edward of all essential misconduct.	301:263,10A  !
2A	I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always	301:263,11A  !
2A	doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some	301:263,12A  !
2A	regret, in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not	301:263,13A  !
2A	want sense, and that is the foundation on which every thing	301:263,14A  !
2A	good may be built. ~ And after all, Marianne, after	301:263,15A  !
2A	all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant	301:263,16A  !
2A	attachment, and all that can be said of one's happiness	301:263,17A  !
2A	depending entirely on any particular person, it is not	301:263,18A  !
2A	meant ~ it is not fit ~ it is not possible that it should be	301:263,19A  !
2A	so. ~ Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman	301:263,20A  !
2A	superior in person and understanding to half her sex;	301:263,21A  !
2A	and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever	301:263,22A  !
2A	thought another superior to \her\." ~	301:263,23A  !
2C	"If such is your way of thinking,"	301:263,24C  !
2C	"if	301:263,24C  !
2C	the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up	301:263,25C  !
2C	by something else, your resolution, your self-command,	301:263,26C  !
2C	are, perhaps, a little less to be wondered at. ~ They are	301:263,27C  !
2C	brought more within my comprehension."	301:263,28C  !
2A	"I understand you. ~ You do not suppose that I have	301:263,29A  !
2A	ever felt much. ~ For four months, Marianne, I have had	301:263,30A  !
2A	all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty	301:263,31A  !
2A	to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it would	301:263,32A  !
2A	make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it	301:263,33A  !
2A	were explained to you, yet unable to prepare you for it	301:263,34A  !
2A	in the least. ~ It was told me, ~ it was in a manner forced	301:263,35A  !
2A	on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement	301:263,36A  !
2A	ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,	301:263,37A  !
2A	with triumph. ~ This person's suspicions, therefore, I	301:263,38A  !
2A	have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent	301:264, 1A  !
2A	where I have been most deeply interested; ~	301:264, 2A  !
2A	and it has not been only once; ~ I have had her hopes	301:264, 3A  !
2A	and exultation to listen to again and again. ~ I have	301:264, 4A  !
2A	known myself to be divided from Edward for ever,	301:264, 5A  !
2A	without hearing one circumstance that could make	301:264, 6A  !
2A	me less desire the connection. ~ Nothing has proved	301:264, 7A  !
2A	him unworthy; nor has any thing declared him indifferent	301:264, 8A  !
2A	to me. ~ I have had to contend against the	301:264, 9A  !
2A	unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of his mother;	301:264,10A  !
2A	and have suffered the punishment of an attachment,	301:264,11A  !
2A	without enjoying its advantages. ~ And all this has been	301:264,12A  !
2A	going on at a time, when, as you too well know, it has	301:264,13A  !
2A	not been my only unhappiness. ~ If you can think me	301:264,14A  !
2A	capable of ever feeling ~ surely you may suppose that	301:264,15A  !
2A	I have suffered \now\.  The composure of mind with which	301:264,16A  !
2A	I have brought myself at present to consider the matter,	301:264,17A  !
2A	the consolation that I have been willing to admit, have	301:264,18A  !
2A	been the effect of constant and painful exertion; ~ they	301:264,19A  !
2A	did not spring up of themselves; ~ they did not occur	301:264,20A  !
2A	to relieve my spirits at first ~ No, Marianne. ~ \Then\, if	301:264,21A  !
2A	I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing could	301:264,22A  !
2A	have kept me entirely ~ not even what I owed to my	301:264,23A  !
2A	dearest friends ~ from openly shewing that I was \very\	301:264,24A  !
2A	unhappy." ~	301:264,25A  !
2C	"Oh| Elinor,"	301:264,27C  !
2C	"you have made me hate	301:264,27C  !
2C	myself for ever. ~ How barbarous have I been to you|	301:264,28C  !
2C	~ you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne	301:264,29C  !

2F	shocking discovery that took place under our roof	301:265,23F  !
2F	yesterday."	301:265,24F  !
2F	"Your sister,"	301:265,27F  !
2F	"has suffered dreadfully.	301:265,27F  !
2F	Mrs% Ferrars too ~ in short it has been a scene of such	301:265,28F  !
2F	complicated distress ~ but I will hope that the storm	301:265,29F  !
2F	may be weathered without our being any of us quite	301:265,30F  !
2F	overcome.  Poor Fanny| she was in hysterics all	301:265,31F  !
2F	yesterday.  But I would not alarm you too much.	301:265,32F  !
2F	Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended;	301:265,33F  !
2F	her constitution is a good one, and her resolution	301:265,34F  !
2F	equal to any thing.  She has borne it all, with the	301:265,35F  !
2F	fortitude of an angel|  She says she never shall think	301:265,36F  !
2F	well of anybody again; and one cannot wonder at it,	301:265,37F  !
2F	after being so deceived| ~ meeting with such ingratitude,	301:265,38F  !
2F	where so much kindness had been shewn, so much	301:266, 1F  !
2F	confidence had been placed|  It was quite out of the	301:266, 2F  !
2F	benevolence of her heart, that she had asked these young	301:266, 3F  !
2F	women to her house; merely because she thought they	301:266, 4F  !
2F	deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved	301:266, 5F  !
2F	girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise	301:266, 6F  !
2F	we both wished very much to have invited you and	301:266, 7F  !
2F	Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there, was	301:266, 8F  !
2F	attending her daughter.  And now to be so rewarded|	301:266, 9F  !
2F	says poor Fanny in her	301:266,10F  !
2F	affectionate way,	301:266,11F  !
2F	"What poor Mrs% Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny	301:266,15F  !
2F	broke it to her, is not to be described.  While she with	301:266,16F  !
2F	the truest affection had been planning a most eligible	301:266,17F  !
2F	connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could	301:266,18F  !
2F	be all the time secretly engaged to another person| ~	301:266,19F  !
2F	such a suspicion could never have entered her head|	301:266,20F  !
2F	If she suspected \any\ prepossession elsewhere, it could	301:266,21F  !
2F	not be in \that\ quarter.	301:266,22F  !
2F	said she,	301:266,22F  !
2F	She was quite in	301:266,23F  !
2F	an agony.  We consulted together, however, as to what	301:266,24F  !
2F	should be done, and at last she determined to send for	301:266,25F  !
2F	Edward.  He came.  But I am sorry to relate what	301:266,26F  !
2F	ensued.  All that Mrs% Ferrars could say to make him	301:266,27F  !
2F	put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may	301:266,28F  !
2F	well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties,	301:266,29F  !
2F	was of no avail.  Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.	301:266,30F  !
2F	I never thought Edward so stubborn, so	301:266,31F  !
2F	unfeeling before.  His mother explained to him her	301:266,32F  !
2F	liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton;	301:266,33F  !
2F	told him that she would settle on him the Norfolk estate,	301:266,34F  !
2F	which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year;	301:266,35F  !
2F	offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it	301:266,36F  !
2F	twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still	301:266,37F  !
2F	persisted in this low connection, represented to him the	301:266,38F  !
2F	certain penury that must attend the match.  His own	301:267, 1F  !
2F	two thousand pounds she protested should be his all;	301:267, 2F  !
2F	she would never see him again; and so far would she	301:267, 3F  !
2F	be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he	301:267, 4F  !
2F	were to enter into any profession with a view of better	301:267, 5F  !

2F	advancing in it."	301:267, 7F  !
2C	"Gracious God| can	301:267, 9C  !
2C	this be possible|"	301:267,10C  !
2F	"Well may you wonder, Marianne,"	301:267,11F  !
2F	"at the obstinacy which could resist such	301:267,12F  !
2F	arguments as these.  Your exclamation is very natural."	301:267,13F  !
2F	"All this, however,"	301:267,16F  !
2F	"was urged in	301:267,16F  !
2F	vain.  Edward said very little; but what he did say,	301:267,17F  !
2F	was in the most determined manner.  Nothing should	301:267,18F  !
2F	prevail on him to give up his engagement.  He would	301:267,19F  !
2F	stand to it, cost him what it might."	301:267,20F  !
2K	"Then,"	301:267,21K  !
2K	"he has acted like an honest	301:267,22K  !
2K	man|  I beg your pardon, Mr% Dashwood, but if he had	301:267,23K  !
2K	done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal.	301:267,24K  !
2K	I have some little concern in the business, as well as yourself,	301:267,25K  !
2K	for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there	301:267,26K  !
2K	is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one who	301:267,27K  !
2K	more deserves a good husband."	301:267,28K  !
2F	"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any	301:267,33F  !
2F	relation of yours, madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare	301:267,34F  !
2F	say, a very deserving young woman, but in the present	301:267,35F  !
2F	case you know, the connection must be impossible.  And	301:267,36F  !
2F	to have entered into a secret engagement with a young	301:267,37F  !
2F	man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman especially	301:267,38F  !
2F	of such very large fortune as Mrs% Ferrars, is perhaps	301:268, 1F  !
2F	altogether a little extraordinary.  In short, I do not	301:268, 2F  !
2F	mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom	301:268, 3F  !
2F	you have a regard for, Mrs% Jennings.  We all wish her	301:268, 4F  !
2F	extremely happy, and Mrs% Ferrars's conduct throughout	301:268, 5F  !
2F	the whole, has been such as every conscientious,	301:268, 6F  !
2F	good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It	301:268, 7F  !
2F	has been dignified and liberal.  Edward has drawn his	301:268, 8F  !
2F	own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one."	301:268, 9F  !
2K	"Well, sir,"	301:268,14K  !
2K	"and how did it	301:268,14K  !
2K	end?"	301:268,15K  !
2F	"I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy	301:268,16F  !
2F	rupture: ~ Edward is dismissed for ever from his	301:268,17F  !
2F	mother's notice.  He left her house yesterday, but where	301:268,18F  !
2F	he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do not know;	301:268,19F  !
2F	for \we\ of course can make no inquiry."	301:268,20F  !
2K	"Poor young man| ~ and what is to become of him?"	301:268,21K  !
2F	"What, indeed, ma'am|  It is a melancholy consideration.	301:268,22F  !
2F	Born to the prospect of such affluence|  I cannot	301:268,23F  !
2F	conceive a situation more deplorable.  The interest of	301:268,24F  !
2F	two thousand pounds ~ how can a man live on it| ~ and	301:268,25F  !
2F	when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but	301:268,26F  !
2F	for his own folly, within three months have been in the	301:268,27F  !
2F	receipt of two thousand, five hundred a-year, (for Miss Morton	301:268,28F  !
2F	has thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture	301:268,29F  !
2F	to myself a more wretched condition.  We must all feel	301:268,30F  !
2F	for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our	301:268,31F  !
2F	power to assist him."	301:268,32F  !
2K	"Poor young man|"	301:268,33K  !
2K	"I am	301:268,33K  !
2K	sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my	301:268,34K  !
2K	house; and so I would tell him if I could see him.  It is	301:268,35K  !
2K	not fit that he should be living about at his own charge	301:268,36K  !
2K	now, at lodgings and taverns."	301:268,37K  !
2F	"If he would only have done as well by himself,"	301:269, 3F  !
2F	"as all his friends were disposed to do	301:269, 4F  !
2F	by him, he might now have been in his proper situation,	301:269, 5F  !
2F	and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it is, it must	301:269, 6F  !
2F	be out of anybody's power to assist him.  And there is	301:269, 7F  !
2F	one thing more preparing against him, which must be	301:269, 8F  !
2F	worse than all ~ his mother has determined, with a very	301:269, 9F  !
2F	natural kind of spirit, to settle \that\ estate upon Robert	301:269,10F  !
2F	immediately, which might have been Edward's, on	301:269,11F  !
2F	proper conditions.  I left her this morning with her	301:269,12F  !
2F	lawyer, talking over the business."	301:269,13F  !
2K	"Well|"	301:269,14K  !
2K	"that is \her\ revenge.	301:269,14K  !
2K	Everybody has a way of their own.  But I don't think	301:269,15K  !
2K	mine would be, to make one son independent, because	301:269,16K  !
2K	another had plagued me."	301:269,17K  !
2F	"Can any thing be more galling to the spirit of a man,"	301:269,19F  !
2F	"than to see his younger brother in	301:269,20F  !
2F	possession of an estate which might have been his own?	301:269,21F  !
2F	Poor Edward|  I feel for him sincerely."	301:269,22F  !
2K	"Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you any thing	302:271,28K  !
2K	if you ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs% Clarke."	302:271,29K  !
2P	"I am so glad to meet you;"	302:271,33P  !
2P	"for I wanted to see you of	302:271,34P  !
2P	all things in the world."	302:271,35P  !
2P	"I suppose Mrs% Jennings has heard all about it.  Is she	302:271,36P  !
2P	angry?"	302:271,37P  !
2A	"Not at all, I believe, with you."	302:271,38A  !
2P	"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is \she\	302:272, 1P  !
2P	angry?"	302:272, 2P  !
2A	"I cannot suppose it possible that she should."	302:272, 3A  !
2P	"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious|  I have	302:272, 4P  !
2P	had such a time of it|  I never saw Lucy in such a rage	302:272, 5P  !
2P	in my life.  She vowed at first she would never trim me	302:272, 6P  !
2P	up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again, so	302:272, 7P  !
2P	long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we	302:272, 8P  !
2P	are as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me this	302:272, 9P  !
2P	bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.  There	302:272,10P  !
2P	now, \you\ are going to laugh at me too.  But why should	302:272,11P  !
2P	not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it is the	302:272,12P  !
2P	Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part, I	302:272,13P  !
2P	should never have known he \did\ like it better than any	302:272,14P  !
2P	other colour, if he had not happened to say so.  My	302:272,15P  !
2P	cousins have been so plaguing me| ~ I declare sometimes	302:272,16P  !
2P	I do not know which way to look before them."	302:272,17P  !
2P	"Well, but Miss Dashwood,"	302:272,21P  !
2P	"people may say what they chuse about Mr% Ferrars's	302:272,22P  !
2P	declaring he would not have Lucy, for it's no such a	302:272,23P  !
2P	thing I can tell you; and it's quite a shame for such	302:272,24P  !
2P	ill-natured reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy	302:272,25P  !
2P	might think about it herself, you know, it was no business	302:272,26P  !
2P	of other people to set it down for certain."	302:272,27P  !
2A	"I never heard anything of the kind hinted at before,	302:272,28A  !
2A	I assure you,"	302:272,29A  !
2P	"Oh| did not you?  But it \was\ said, I know, very	302:272,30P  !
2P	well, and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,	302:272,31P  !
2P	that nobody in their senses could expect Mr% Ferrars	302:272,32P  !
2P	to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with	302:272,33P  !
2P	thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele	302:272,34P  !
2P	that had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks	302:272,35P  !
2P	myself.  And besides that, my cousin Richard said	302:272,36P  !
2P	himself, that when it came to the point, he was afraid	302:272,37P  !
2P	Mr% Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not	302:272,38P  !
2P	come near us for three days, I could not tell what to	302:273, 1P  !
2P	think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it	302:273, 2P  !
2P	all up for lost; for we came away from your brother's on	302:273, 3P  !
2P	Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday,	302:273, 4P  !
2P	Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was	302:273, 5P  !
2P	become with him.  Once Lucy thought to write to him,	302:273, 6P  !
2P	but then her spirit rose against that.  However this	302:273, 7P  !
2P	morning he came just as we came home from church;	302:273, 8P  !
2P	and then it all came out, how he had been sent for	302:273, 9P  !
2P	Wednesday to Harley-street, and been talked to by	302:273,10P  !
2P	his mother and all of them, and how he had declared	302:273,11P  !
2P	before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and	302:273,12P  !
2P	nobody but Lucy would he have.  And how he had been	302:273,13P  !
2P	so worried by what passed, that as soon as he had went	302:273,14P  !
2P	away from his mother's house, he had got upon his	302:273,15P  !
2P	horse, and rid into the country some where or other;	302:273,16P  !
2P	and how he had staid about at an inn all Thursday and	302:273,17P  !
2P	Friday, on purpose to get the better of it.  And after	302:273,18P  !
2P	thinking it all over and over again, he said, it seemed to	302:273,19P  !
2P	him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all,	302:273,20P  !
2P	it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement,	302:273,21P  !
2P	because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing	302:273,22P  !
2P	but two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing	302:273,23P  !
2P	else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some	302:273,24P  !
2P	thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how	302:273,25P  !
2P	was they to live upon that? ~ He could not bear to think	302:273,26P  !
2P	of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the	302:273,27P  !
2P	least mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly,	302:273,28P  !
2P	and leave him to shift for himself.  I heard him say all	302:273,29P  !
2P	this as plain as could possibly be.  And it was entirely	302:273,30P  !
2P	for \her\ sake, and upon \her\ account, that he said a word	302:273,31P  !
2P	about being off, and not upon his own.  I will take my	302:273,32P  !
2P	oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or	302:273,33P  !
2P	of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or anything like it.	302:273,34P  !
2P	But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of	302:273,35P  !
2P	talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about	302:273,36P  !
2P	sweet and love, you know, and all that ~ Oh, la| one	302:273,37P  !
2P	can't repeat such kind of things you know) ~ she told	302:273,38P  !
2P	him directly, she had not the least mind in the world to	302:274, 1P  !
2P	be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how	302:274, 2P  !
2P	little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to	302:274, 3P  !
2P	have it all, you know, or something of the kind.  So then	302:274, 4P  !
2P	he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about	302:274, 5P  !
2P	what they should do, and they agreed he should take	302:274, 6P  !
2P	orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he	302:274, 7P  !
2P	got a living.  And just then I could not hear any more,	302:274, 8P  !
2P	for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs% Richardson	302:274, 9P  !
2P	was come in her coach, and would take one of us to	302:274,10P  !
2P	Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the	302:274,11P  !
2P	room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like	302:274,12P  !
2P	to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just	302:274,13P  !
2P	run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings, and came	302:274,14P  !
2P	off with the Richardsons."	302:274,15P  !
2A	"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting	302:274,16A  !
2A	them"	302:274,17A  !
2A	"you were all in the same room	302:274,17A  !
2A	together, were not you?"	302:274,18A  !
2P	"No, indeed, not us.  La|  Miss Dashwood, do you	302:274,19P  !
2P	think people make love when any body else is by?  Oh	302:274,20P  !
2P	for shame| ~ To be sure you must know better than that.	302:274,21P  !
2P	No, no; they were shut up in	302:274,22P  !
2P	the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only	302:274,23P  !
2P	by listening at the door."	302:274,24P  !
2A	"How|"	302:274,25A  !
2A	"have you been repeating	302:274,25A  !
2A	to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the	302:274,26A  !
2A	door?  I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly	302:274,27A  !
2A	would not have suffered you to give me particulars	302:274,28A  !
2A	of a conversation which you ought not to have known	302:274,29A  !
2A	yourself.  How could you behave so unfairly by your	302:274,30A  !
2A	sister?"	302:274,31A  !
2P	"Oh, la| there is nothing in \that\.  I only stood at the	302:274,32P  !
2P	door, and heard what I could.  And I am sure Lucy	302:274,33P  !
2P	would have done just the same by me; for a year or two	302:274,34P  !
2P	back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets	302:274,35P  !
2P	together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet,	302:274,36P  !
2P	or behind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we	302:274,37P  !
2P	said."	302:274,38P  !

2P	"but now he is lodging at No% @@, Pall Mall.  What an	302:275, 5P  !
2P	ill-natured woman his mother is, an't she?  And your	302:275, 6P  !

2P	I shan't say anything against them to \you\; and to be	302:275, 8P  !
2P	sure they did send us home in their own chariot, which	302:275, 9P  !

2Q	I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty	302:277,10Q  !
2Q	I take of writing to her; but I know your friendship for	302:277,11Q  !
2Q	me will make you pleased to hear such a good account	302:277,12Q  !
2Q	of myself and my dear Edward, after all the troubles	302:277,13Q  !
2Q	we have went through lately, therefore will make no	302:277,14Q  !
2Q	more apologies, but proceed to say that, thank God|	302:277,15Q  !
2Q	though we have suffered dreadfully, we are both quite	302:277,16Q  !
2Q	well now, and as happy as we must always be in one	302:277,17Q  !
2Q	another's love.  We have had great trials, and great	302:277,18Q  !
2Q	persecutions, but however, at the same time, gratefully	302:277,19Q  !
2Q	acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least among	302:277,20Q  !
2Q	them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully	302:277,21Q  !
2Q	remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of it.	302:277,22Q  !
2Q	I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs% Jennings,	302:277,23Q  !
2Q	I spent two happy hours with him yesterday	302:277,24Q  !
2Q	afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though	302:277,25Q  !
2Q	earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him	302:277,26Q  !
2Q	to it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever	302:277,27Q  !
2Q	on the spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should	302:277,28Q  !
2Q	never be, he did not regard his mother's anger, while he	302:277,29Q  !
2Q	could have my affections; our prospects are not very	302:277,30Q  !
2Q	bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for the	302:277,31Q  !
2Q	best; he will be ordained shortly, and should it ever be	302:277,32Q  !
2Q	in your power to recommend him to any body that has	302:277,33Q  !
2Q	a living to bestow, am very sure you will not forget us,	302:277,34Q  !
2Q	and dear Mrs% Jennings too, trust she will speak a good	302:277,35Q  !
2Q	word for us to Sir John, or Mr% Palmer, or any friend that	302:277,36Q  !
2Q	may be able to assist us. ~ Poor Anne was much to blame	302:277,37Q  !
2Q	for what she did, but she did it for the best, so I say	302:277,38Q  !
2Q	nothing; hope Mrs% Jennings won't think it too much	302:278, 1Q  !
2Q	trouble to give us a call, should she come this way any	302:278, 2Q  !
2Q	morning, 'twould be a great kindness, and my cousins	302:278, 3Q  !
2Q	would be proud to know her. ~ My paper reminds me to	302:278, 4Q  !

2Q	remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton,	302:278, 6Q  !
2Q	and the dear children, when you chance to	302:278, 7Q  !

2K	How attentive she is, to think of every body| ~ Thank	302:278,22K  !

2H	"of	303:282,15H  !
2H	the injustice your friend Mr% Ferrars has suffered from	303:282,16H  !
2H	his family; for if I understand the matter right, he has	303:282,17H  !
2H	been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his	303:282,18H  !
2H	engagement with a very deserving young woman ~	303:282,19H  !
2H	Have I been rightly informed? ~ Is it so?" ~	303:282,20H  !
2H	"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty," ~	303:282,22H  !
2H	"of dividing, or attempting to divide,	303:282,23H  !
2H	two young people long attached to each other, is terrible	303:282,24H  !
2H	~ Mrs% Ferrars does not know what she may be doing ~	303:282,25H  !
2H	what she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr% Ferrars	303:282,26H  !
2H	two or three times in Harley-street, and am much pleased	303:282,27H  !
2H	with him.  He is not a young man with whom one can	303:282,28H  !
2H	be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have	303:282,29H  !
2H	seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,	303:282,30H  !
2H	and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.  I understand	303:282,31H  !
2H	that he intends to take orders.  Will you be so	303:282,32H  !
2H	good as to tell him that the living of Delaford, now just	303:282,33H  !
2H	vacant, as I am informed by this day's post, is his, if he	303:282,34H  !
2H	think it worth his acceptance ~ but \that\, perhaps, so	303:282,35H  !
2H	unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be	303:282,36H  !
2H	nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more	303:282,37H  !
2H	valuable. ~ It is a rectory, but a small one; the late	303:282,38H  !
2H	incumbent, I believe, did not make more than 200\l%\ per annum,	303:283, 1H  !
2H	and though it is certainly capable of improvement,	303:283, 2H  !
2H	I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him	303:283, 3H  !
2H	a very comfortable income.  Such as it is, however, my	303:283, 4H  !
2H	pleasure in presenting him to it, will be very great.	303:283, 5H  !
2H	Pray assure him of it."	303:283, 6H  !
2A	"The smallness of the house,"	303:284, 5A  !
2A	"I cannot	303:284, 5A  !
2A	imagine any inconvenience to them, for it will be in	303:284, 6A  !
2A	proportion to their family and income."	303:284, 7A  !
2H	"This little rectory \can\ do no more than make Mr% Ferrars	303:284,14H  !
2H	comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him	303:284,15H  !
2H	to marry.  I am sorry to say that my patronage ends	303:284,16H  !
2H	with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive.	303:284,17H  !
2H	If, however, by any unforeseen chance it should be in	303:284,18H  !
2H	my power to serve him farther, I must think very	303:284,19H  !
2H	differently of him from what I now do, if I am not as	303:284,20H  !
2H	ready to be useful to him then, as I sincerely wish I	303:284,21H  !
2H	could be at present.  What I am now doing indeed,	303:284,22H  !
2H	seems nothing at all, since it can advance him so little	303:284,23H  !
2H	towards what must be his principal, his only object of	303:284,24H  !
2H	happiness.  His marriage must still be a distant good; ~	303:284,25H  !
2H	at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon. ~"	303:284,26H  !

2K	to you; for though, upon my honour, I \tried\ to keep out	304:285, 4K  !
2K	of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand	304:285, 5K  !
2K	his business.  And I assure you I never was better	304:285, 6K  !
2K	pleased in my life, and I wish you joy of it with all my	304:285, 7K  !

2A	of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon	304:285,10A  !
2A	most sensibly.  There are not many men who	304:285,11A  !
2A	would act as he has done.  Few people who have so compassionate	304:285,12A  !
2A	an heart|  I never was more astonished in my	304:285,13A  !

2K	"Lord| my dear, you are very modest|  I an't the	304:285,15K  !

2K	thought of late, there was nothing more likely to	304:285,17K  !
2K	happen."	304:285,18K  !
2A	"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's	304:285,19A  !
2A	general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee	304:285,20A  !
2A	that the opportunity would so very soon occur."	304:285,21A  !
2K	"Opportunity|"	304:285,22K  !
2K	"Oh| as	304:285,22K  !
2K	to that, when a man has once made up his mind to	304:285,23K  !
2K	such a thing, somehow or other he will soon find an	304:285,24K  !
2K	opportunity.  Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again	304:285,25K  !
2K	and again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the	304:285,26K  !
2K	world, I think I shall soon know where to look for	304:285,27K  !
2K	them."	304:285,28K  !
2A	"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,"	304:285,29A  !
2K	"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the	304:285,31K  !
2K	house being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel	304:285,32K  !
2K	would be at, for it is a good a one as ever I saw."	304:285,33K  !
2A	"He spoke of its being out of repair."	304:286, 1A  !
2K	"Well, and whose fault is that?  why don't he	304:286, 2K  !
2K	repair it? ~ who should do it but himself?"	304:286, 3K  !
2K	"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had	304:286, 7K  !
2K	half my talk out.  But, however, we may have it all	304:286, 8K  !
2K	over in the evening, for we shall be quite alone.  I do	304:286, 9K  !
2K	not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is	304:286,10K  !
2K	too full of the matter to care for company; and besides,	304:286,11K  !
2K	you must long to tell your sister all about it."	304:286,12K  !
2A	"Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but	304:286,15A  !
2A	I shall not mention it at present to any body else."	304:286,16A  !
2K	"Oh| very well,"	304:286,17K  !
2K	"Then you would not have me tell it Lucy,	304:286,18K  !
2K	for I think of going as far as Holborn to-day."	304:286,19K  !
2A	"No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please.  One day's	304:286,20A  !
2A	delay will not be very material; and till I have written	304:286,21A  !
2A	to Mr% Ferrars, I think it ought not to be mentioned to	304:286,22A  !
2A	any body else.  I shall do \that\ directly.  It is of importance	304:286,23A  !
2A	that no time should be lost with him, for he will	304:286,24A  !
2A	of course have much to do relative to his ordination."	304:286,25A  !
2K	"Oh ho| ~ I understand you.  Mr% Ferrars is to be	304:286,31K  !
2K	the man.  Well, so much the better for him.  Aye, to be	304:286,32K  !
2K	sure, he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very	304:286,33K  !
2K	glad to find things are so forward between you.  But, my	304:286,34K  !
2K	dear, is not this rather out of character?  Should not	304:286,35K  !
2K	the Colonel write himself? ~ sure, he is the proper	304:286,36K  !
2K	person."	304:286,37K  !

2A	than himself."	304:287, 6A  !
2K	"And so \you\ are forced to do it.  Well, \that\ is an odd	304:287, 7K  !
2K	kind of delicacy|  However, I will not disturb you	304:287, 8K  !
2K	You know your own concerns	304:287, 9K  !

2K	whether she would do for a lady's maid, I am sure I can't	304:287,16K  !
2K	tell.  She is an excellent housemaid, and works very	304:287,17K  !

2A	"without receiving	304:288,28A  !
2A	our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give	304:288,29A  !
2A	them in person.  Mrs% Jennings was quite right in what	304:288,30A  !

2A	Colonel Brandon,	304:288,34A  !

2A	has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford,	304:288,37A  !
2A	now just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable.	304:288,38A  !
2A	Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable	304:289, 1A  !
2A	and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that	304:289, 2A  !
2A	the living ~ it is about two hundred a-year ~ were much	304:289, 3A  !
2A	more considerable, and such as might better enable you	304:289, 4A  !
2A	to ~ as might be more than a temporary accommodation	304:289, 5A  !
2A	to yourself ~ such, in short, as might establish all your	304:289, 6A  !

2A	"Yes,"	304:289,14A  !
2A	"Colonel Brandon	304:289,15A  !

2A	conduct of your family has placed you ~ a concern which	304:289,18A  !
2A	I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends must	304:289,19A  !
2A	share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for	304:289,20A  !

2A	you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely, to your own	304:289,32A  !
2A	merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment of it.  I have	304:289,33A  !
2A	had no hand in it.  I did not even know, till I understood	304:289,34A  !
2A	his design, that the living was vacant; nor had	304:289,35A  !
2A	it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a	304:289,36A  !

2A	(for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the	304:290,19A  !
2A	mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he	304:290,20A  !
2A	\should\ be all this."	304:290,21A  !
2B	"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St% James's-street,"	304:290,27B  !
2B	"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks	304:290,30B  !
2B	which you will not allow me to give \you\; to assure him	304:290,31B  !
2B	that he has made me a very ~ an exceedingly happy man."	304:290,32B  !
2A	"When I see him again,"	304:291, 1A  !
2A	"I shall see him the husband of Lucy."	304:291, 2A  !
2K	"Well, my dear,"	304:291,13K  !
2K	"I sent you up the young	304:291,13K  !
2K	man.  Did not I do right? ~ And I suppose you had no	304:291,14K  !
2K	great difficulty ~ You did not find him very unwilling to	304:291,15K  !
2K	accept your proposal?"	304:291,16K  !
2A	"No, ma'am; \that\ was not very likely."	304:291,17A  !
2K	"Well, and how soon will he be ready? ~ For it seems	304:291,18K  !
2K	all to depend upon that."	304:291,19K  !
2A	"Really,"	304:291,20A  !
2A	"I know so little of these kind	304:291,20A  !
2A	of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the	304:291,21A  !
2A	time, or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two	304:291,22A  !
2A	or three months will complete his ordination."	304:291,23A  !
2K	"Two or three months|"	304:291,24K  !
2K	"Lord| my dear, how calmly you talk of it; and can	304:291,25K  !
2K	the Colonel wait two or three months|  Lord bless me| ~	304:291,26K  !
2K	I am sure it would put \me\ quite out of patience| ~ And	304:291,27K  !
2K	though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor	304:291,28K  !
2K	Mr% Ferrars, I do think it is not worth while to wait two	304:291,29K  !
2K	or three months for him.  Sure, somebody else might	304:291,30K  !
2K	be found that would do as well; somebody that is in	304:291,31K  !
2K	orders already."	304:291,32K  !
2A	"My dear ma'am,"	304:291,33A  !
2A	"what can you be	304:291,33A  !
2A	thinking of? ~ Why, Colonel Brandon's only object is to	304:291,34A  !
2A	be of use to Mr% Ferrars."	304:291,35A  !
2K	"Lord bless you, my dear| ~ Sure you do not mean	304:291,36K  !
2K	to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for	304:291,37K  !
2K	the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr% Ferrars|"	304:291,38K  !
2K	"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,"	304:292, 7K  !
2K	"and very likely \may\ be out of repair; but	304:292, 9K  !
2K	to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for a house that	304:292,10K  !
2K	to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor,	304:292,11K  !
2K	and I think the housekeeper told me, could make	304:292,12K  !
2K	up fifteen beds| ~ and to you too, that had been used to	304:292,13K  !
2K	live in Barton cottage| ~ It seemed quite ridiculous.	304:292,14K  !
2K	But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do something	304:292,15K  !
2K	to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for	304:292,16K  !
2K	them, before Lucy goes to it."	304:292,17K  !
2A	"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any	304:292,18A  !
2A	idea of the living's being enough to allow them to marry."	304:292,19A  !
2K	"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two	304:292,20K  !
2K	thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can	304:292,21K  !
2K	marry on less.  Take my word for it, that, if I am alive,	304:292,22K  !
2K	I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before	304:292,23K  !
2K	Michaelmas; and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't	304:292,24K  !
2K	there."	304:292,25K  !
2F	"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,"	305:294,22F  !
2F	"I will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not have	305:294,23F  !
2F	the least objection in the world to seeing \you\. ~ Very	305:294,24F  !
2F	far from it indeed.  \Now\ especially there cannot be ~	305:294,25F  !
2F	but however, you and Marianne were always great	305:294,26F  !
2F	favourites. ~ Why would not Marianne come?" ~	305:294,27F  !
2F	"I am not sorry to see you alone,"	305:294,29F  !
2F	"for I have a good deal to say to you.  This living	305:294,30F  !
2F	of Colonel Brandon's ~ can it be true? ~ has he really	305:294,31F  !
2F	given it to Edward? ~ I heard it yesterday by chance,	305:294,32F  !
2F	and was coming to you on purpose to inquire farther	305:294,33F  !
2F	about it."	305:294,34F  !
2A	"It is perfectly true. ~ Colonel Brandon has given	305:294,35A  !
2A	the living of Delaford to Edward."	305:294,36A  !
2F	"Really| ~ Well, this is very astonishing| ~ no relationship| ~	305:294,37F  !
2F	no connection between then| ~ and now that	305:294,38F  !
2F	livings fetch such a price| ~ what was the value of	305:295, 1F  !
2F	this?"	305:295, 2F  !
2A	"About two hundred a-year."	305:295, 3A  !
2F	"Very well ~ and for the next presentation to a living	305:295, 4F  !
2F	of that value ~ supposing the late incumbent to have been	305:295, 5F  !
2F	old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon ~ he might	305:295, 6F  !
2F	have got I dare say ~ fourteen hundred pounds.  And	305:295, 7F  !
2F	how came he not to have settled that matter before this	305:295, 8F  !
2F	person's death? ~ \Now\ indeed it would be too late to	305:295, 9F  !
2F	sell it, but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense| ~ I wonder	305:295,10F  !
2F	he should be so improvident in a point of such common,	305:295,11F  !
2F	such natural, concern| ~ Well, I am convinced that	305:295,12F  !
2F	there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every	305:295,13F  !
2F	human character.  I suppose, however ~ on recollection	305:295,14F  !
2F	~ that the case may probably be \this\.  Edward is only	305:295,15F  !
2F	to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel	305:295,16F  !
2F	has really sold the presentation, is old enough to take	305:295,17F  !
2F	it. ~ Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it."	305:295,18F  !
2F	"It is truly astonishing|" ~	305:295,24F  !
2F	"what could be the Colonel's motive?"	305:295,25F  !
2A	"A very simple one ~ to be of use to Mr% Ferrars."	305:295,26A  !
2F	"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be,	305:295,27F  !
2F	Edward is a very lucky man| ~ You will not mention the	305:295,28F  !
2F	matter to Fanny, however, for though I have broke it	305:295,29F  !
2F	to her, and she bears it vastly well, ~ she will not like to	305:295,30F  !
2F	hear it much talked of."	305:295,31F  !
2F	"Mrs% Ferrars,"	305:295,37F  !
2F	"knows nothing	305:295,38F  !
2F	about it at present, and I believe it will be best to keep	305:296, 1F  !
2F	it entirely concealed from her as long as may be. ~ When	305:296, 2F  !
2F	the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all."	305:296, 3F  !
2A	"But why should such precaution be used? ~ Though	305:296, 4A  !
2A	it is not to be supposed that Mrs% Ferrars can have the	305:296, 5A  !
2A	smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money	305:296, 6A  !
2A	enough to live upon, ~ for \that\ must be quite out of the	305:296, 7A  !
2A	question; yet why, after her late behaviour, is she	305:296, 8A  !
2A	supposed to feel at all? ~ she has done with her son, she	305:296, 9A  !
2A	has cast him off for ever, and has made all those over	305:296,10A  !
2A	whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise.	305:296,11A  !
2A	Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable to	305:296,12A  !
2A	any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account ~	305:296,13A  !
2A	she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him. ~	305:296,14A  !
2A	She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort	305:296,15A  !
2A	of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent|"	305:296,16A  !
2F	"Ah|  Elinor,"	305:296,17F  !
2F	"your reasoning is very	305:296,17F  !
2F	good, but it is founded on ignorance of human nature.	305:296,18F  !
2F	When Edward's unhappy match takes place, depend	305:296,19F  !
2F	upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never	305:296,20F  !
2F	discarded him; and therefore every circumstance that	305:296,21F  !
2F	may accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed	305:296,22F  !
2F	from her as much as possible.  Mrs% Ferrars can never	305:296,23F  !
2F	forget that Edward is her son."	305:296,24F  !
2A	"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly	305:296,25A  !
2A	have escaped her memory by \this\ time."	305:296,26A  !
2F	"You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs% Ferrars is one	305:296,27F  !
2F	of the most affectionate mothers in the world."	305:296,28F  !

2F	"Choice| ~ how do you mean?" ~	305:296,35F  !
2A	"I only mean, that I suppose from your manner of	305:296,36A  !
2A	speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether	305:296,37A  !
2A	she marry Edward or Robert."	305:296,38A  !
2F	"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert	305:297, 1F  !
2F	will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the	305:297, 2F  !
2F	eldest son; ~ and as to any thing else, they are both	305:297, 3F  !
2F	very agreeable young men, I do not know that one is	305:297, 4F  !
2F	superior to the other."	305:297, 5F  !
2F	"Of \one\ thing, my dear sister,"	305:297, 8F  !
2F	"I may assure you; ~	305:297, 9F  !
2F	and I \will\ do it, because I know it must gratify you.	305:297,10F  !
2F	I have good reason to think ~ indeed I have it from the	305:297,11F  !
2F	best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it	305:297,12F  !
2F	would be very wrong to say any thing about it ~ but	305:297,13F  !
2F	I have it from the very best authority ~ not that I ever	305:297,14F  !
2F	precisely heard Mrs% Ferrars say it herself ~ but her	305:297,15F  !
2F	daughter \did\, and I have it from her ~ That in short,	305:297,16F  !
2F	whatever objections there might be against a certain ~	305:297,17F  !
2F	a certain connection ~ you understand me ~ it would	305:297,18F  !
2F	have been far preferable to her, it would not have given	305:297,19F  !
2F	her half the vexation that \this\ does.  I was exceedingly	305:297,20F  !
2F	pleased to hear that Mrs% Ferrars considered it in that	305:297,21F  !
2F	light ~ a very gratifying circumstance you know to us	305:297,22F  !
2F	all.	305:297,23F  !
2F	she said,	305:297,23F  !
2F	But however, all	305:297,25F  !
2F	that is quite out of the question ~ not to be thought of	305:297,26F  !
2F	or mentioned ~ as to any attachment you know ~ it	305:297,27F  !
2F	never could be ~ all that is gone by.  But I thought I	305:297,28F  !
2F	would just tell you of this, because I knew how much	305:297,29F  !
2F	it must please you.  Not that you have any reason to	305:297,30F  !
2F	regret, my dear Elinor.  There is no doubt of your doing	305:297,31F  !
2F	exceedingly well ~ quite as well, or better, perhaps, all	305:297,32F  !
2F	things considered.  Has Colonel Brandon been with you	305:297,33F  !
2F	lately?"	305:297,34F  !

2S	amusement, giving way to feelings which I had always	308:320, 6S  !
2S	been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured,	308:320, 7S  !

2S	formality of her notions, her ignorance of the world ~	308:323, 6S  !
2S	every thing was against me.  The matter itself I could	308:323, 7S  !
2S	not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it.	308:323, 8S  !
2S	She was previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the	308:323, 9S  !
2S	morality of my conduct in general, and was moreover	308:323,10S  !

2S	the next morning ~ was spent by me in deliberating on	308:323,19S  !
2S	what my future conduct should be.  The struggle was	308:323,20S  !
2S	great ~ but it ended too soon.  My affection for Marianne,	308:323,21S  !
2S	my thorough conviction of her attachment to me ~ it	308:323,22S  !
2S	was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty,	308:323,23S  !
2S	or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity	308:323,24S  !
2S	of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and	308:323,25S  !
2S	expensive society had increased.  I had reason to believe	308:323,26S  !
2S	myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address	308:323,27S  !
2S	her, and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else	308:323,28S  !
2S	in common prudence remained for me to do.  An heavy	308:323,29S  !
2S	scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;	308:323,30S  !
2S	~ I was engaged to dine with you on that very	308:323,31S  !
2S	day; some apology was therefore necessary for my	308:323,32S  !
2S	breaking the engagement.  But whether I should write	308:323,33S  !
2S	this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long	308:323,34S  !
2S	debate.  To see Marianne, I felt would be dreadful, and	308:323,35S  !
2S	I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep	308:323,36S  !
2S	to my resolution.  In that point, however, I undervalued	308:323,37S  !
2S	my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went,	308:323,38S  !
2S	I saw her, and saw her miserable, and left her miserable	308:324, 1S  !
2S	~ and left her hoping never to see her again."	308:324, 2S  !
2A	"Why did you call, Mr% Willoughby?"	308:324, 3A  !

2A	purpose. ~ Why was it necessary to call?"	308:324, 5A  !

2S	of what had really passed between Mrs% Smith and	308:324, 9S  !
2S	myself ~ and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,	308:324,10S  !
2S	in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister,	308:324,11S  !
2S	however, was really dreadful; and to heighten the	308:324,12S  !
2S	matter, I found her alone.  You were all gone I do not	308:324,13S  !
2S	know where.  I had left her only the evening before, so	308:324,14S  !
2S	fully, so firmly resolved within myself on doing right|	308:324,15S  !

2S	in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more	308:325,18S  !
2S	simple one ~ perhaps too simple to raise any emotion ~	308:325,19S  !

2S	"Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was still as	308:325,36S  !
2S	dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,	308:325,37S  !
2S	many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant	308:325,38S  !
2S	in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy	308:326, 1S  !
2S	of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say	308:326, 2S  !
2S	awakened, because time and London, business and	308:326, 3S  !
2S	dissipation, had in some measure quieted it, and I had	308:326, 4S  !
2S	been growing a fine hardened villain, fancying myself	308:326, 5S  !
2S	indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that she too	308:326, 6S  !
2S	must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself	308:326, 7S  !
2S	of our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling, business,	308:326, 8S  !
2S	shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so, and	308:326, 9S  !
2S	silencing every reproach, overcoming every scruple, by	308:326,10S  !
2S	secretly saying now and then, ""I shall be heartily glad	308:326,11S  !
2S	to hear she is well married."" ~ But this note made me	308:326,12S  !
2S	know myself better.  I felt that she was infinitely dearer	308:326,13S  !
2S	to me than any other woman in the world, and that I was	308:326,14S  !
2S	using her infamously.  But everything was then just	308:326,15S  !
2S	settled between Miss Grey and me.  To retreat was impossible.	308:326,16S  !
2S	All that I had to do, was to avoid you both.	308:326,17S  !
2S	I sent no answer to Marianne, intending by that means	308:326,18S  !
2S	to preserve myself from her farther notice; and for	308:326,19S  !
2S	some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley-street;	308:326,20S  !
2S	~ but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of	308:326,21S  !
2S	a cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I	308:326,22S  !
2S	watched you all safely out of the house one morning, and	308:326,23S  !

2S	I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling	308:326,27S  !
2S	in with you.  I have entered many a shop to avoid your	308:326,28S  !
2S	sight, as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did in	308:326,29S  !
2S	Bond-street, there was hardly a day in which I did not	308:326,30S  !
2S	catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing	308:326,31S  !
2S	but the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most	308:326,32S  !
2S	invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight,	308:326,33S  !
2S	could have separated us so long.  I avoided the Middletons	308:326,34S  !
2S	as much as possible, as well as everybody else who	308:326,35S  !
2S	was likely to prove an acquaintance in common.  Not	308:326,36S  !
2S	aware of their being in town, however, I blundered on	308:326,37S  !
2S	Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the	308:326,38S  !
2S	day after I had called at Mrs% Jennings's.  He asked me to	308:327, 1S  !
2S	a party, a dance at his house in the evening. ~ Had he	308:327, 2S  !
2S	\not\ told me as an inducement that you and your sister	308:327, 3S  !
2S	were to be there, I should have felt it too certain a thing,	308:327, 4S  !
2S	to trust myself near him.  The next morning brought	308:327, 5S  !
2S	another short note from Marianne ~ still affectionate,	308:327, 6S  !
2S	open, artless, confiding ~ everything that could make	308:327, 7S  !
2S	\my\ conduct most hateful.  I could not answer it.  I tried	308:327, 8S  !
2S	~ but could not frame a sentence.  But I thought of her,	308:327, 9S  !
2S	I believe, every moment of the day.  If you \can\ pity me,	308:327,10S  !
2S	Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was \then\.  With	308:327,11S  !
2S	my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play	308:327,12S  !
2S	the happy lover to another woman| ~ Those three or	308:327,13S  !
2S	four weeks were worse than all.  Well, at last, as I need	308:327,14S  !
2S	not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a sweet	308:327,15S  !
2S	figure I cut| ~ what an evening of agony it was| ~	308:327,16S  !
2S	Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me	308:327,17S  !
2S	Willoughby in such a tone| ~ Oh| God| ~ holding out	308:327,18S  !
2S	her hand to me, asking me for an explanation with those	308:327,19S  !
2S	bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my	308:327,20S  !
2S	face| ~ and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other	308:327,21S  !
2S	hand, looking all that was ~ Well, it does not signify;	308:327,22S  !
2S	it is over now.  ~ Such an evening| ~ I ran away from	308:327,23S  !
2S	you all as soon as I could; but not before I had seen	308:327,24S  !
2S	Marianne's sweet face as white as death. ~ \That\ was the	308:327,25S  !
2S	last, last look I ever had of her; ~ the last manner in	308:327,26S  !
2S	which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid sight| ~	308:327,27S  !
2S	Yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying, it was	308:327,28S  !
2S	a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly	308:327,29S  !
2S	how she would appear to those, who saw her last in this	308:327,30S  !
2S	world.  She was before me, constantly before me, as	308:327,31S  !
2S	I travelled, in the same look and hue."	308:327,32S  !
2S	"Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister	308:327,35S  !
2S	is certainly better, certainly out of danger?"	308:327,36S  !
2A	"We are assured of it."	308:327,37A  !
2S	"Your poor mother too| ~ doting on Marianne."	308:327,38S  !
2A	"But the letter, Mr% Willoughby, your own letter;	308:328, 1A  !
2A	have you anything to say about that?"	308:328, 2A  !
2S	"Yes, yes, \that\ in particular.  Your sister wrote to	308:328, 3S  !
2S	me again, you know, the very next morning.  You saw	308:328, 4S  !
2S	what she said.  I was breakfasting at the Ellisons, ~ and	308:328, 5S  !
2S	her letter, with some others, was brought to me there	308:328, 6S  !
2S	from my lodgings.  It happened to catch Sophia's eye	308:328, 7S  !
2S	before it caught mine ~ and its size, the elegance of the	308:328, 8S  !
2S	paper, the hand-writing altogether, immediately gave	308:328, 9S  !
2S	her a suspicion.  Some vague report had reached her	308:328,10S  !
2S	before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire,	308:328,11S  !
2S	and what had passed within her observation the	308:328,12S  !
2S	preceding evening had marked who the young lady	308:328,13S  !
2S	was, and made her more jealous than ever.  Affecting	308:328,14S  !
2S	that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in	308:328,15S  !
2S	a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and	308:328,16S  !
2S	read its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.	308:328,17S  !
2S	She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness	308:328,18S  !
2S	I could have borne, but her passion ~ her malice ~ At	308:328,19S  !
2S	all events it must be appeased.  And in short ~ what do	308:328,20S  !
2S	you think of my wife's style of letter-writing? ~ delicate	308:328,21S  !
2S	~ tender ~ truly feminine ~ was it not?"	308:328,22S  !
2A	"Your wife| ~ The letter was in your own hand-writing."	308:328,23A  !
2S	"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such	308:328,25S  !
2S	sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to.  The	308:328,26S  !
2S	original was all her own ~ her own happy thoughts and	308:328,27S  !
2S	gentle diction.  But what could I do? ~ we were engaged,	308:328,28S  !
2S	every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed ~ But I	308:328,29S  !
2S	am talking like a fool.  Preparation| ~ day| ~ In honest	308:328,30S  !
2S	words, her money was necessary to me, and in a situation	308:328,31S  !
2S	like mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.	308:328,32S  !
2S	And after all, what did it signify to my character in the	308:328,33S  !
2S	opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language	308:328,34S  !
2S	my answer was couched? ~ It must have been only to one	308:328,35S  !
2S	end.  My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and	308:328,36S  !
2S	whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little	308:328,37S  !
2S	importance. ~ ""I am ruined for ever in their opinion ~	308:328,38S  !
2S	said I to myself ~ I am shut out for ever from their	308:329, 1S  !
2S	society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow,	308:329, 2S  !
2S	this letter will only make them think me a blackguard	308:329, 3S  !
2S	one."" Such were my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate	308:329, 4S  !
2S	carelessness, I copied my wife's words, and parted with	308:329, 5S  !
2S	the last relics of Marianne.  Her three notes ~ unluckily	308:329, 6S  !
2S	they were all in my pocket-book, or I should have denied	308:329, 7S  !
2S	their existence, and hoarded them for ever ~ I was forced	308:329, 8S  !
2S	to put them up, and could not even kiss them.  And	308:329, 9S  !
2S	the lock of hair ~ that too I had always carried about	308:329,10S  !
2S	me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched	308:329,11S  !
2S	by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence, ~ the	308:329,12S  !
2S	dear lock ~ all, every memento was torn from me."	308:329,13S  !
2A	"You are very wrong, Mr% Willoughby, very blameable,"	308:329,14A  !
2A	"you ought not	308:329,16A  !
2A	to speak in this way, either of Mrs% Willoughby or my	308:329,17A  !
2A	sister.  You have made your own choice.  It was not	308:329,18A  !
2A	forced on you.  Your wife has a claim to your politeness,	308:329,19A  !
2A	to your respect, at least.  She must be attached to you,	308:329,20A  !
2A	or she would not have married you.  To treat her with	308:329,21A  !
2A	unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement	308:329,22A  !
2A	to Marianne ~ nor can I suppose it a relief to your own	308:329,23A  !
2A	conscience."	308:329,24A  !

2S	"She does not deserve your compassion. ~	308:329,26S  !
2S	She knew I had no regard for her when we married. ~	308:329,27S  !
2S	Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna	308:329,28S  !
2S	to be happy, and afterwards returned to town	308:329,29S  !
2S	to be gay. ~ And now do you pity me, Miss Dashwood?	308:329,30S  !
2S	~ or have I said all this to no purpose? ~ Am I ~	308:329,31S  !
2S	be it only one degree ~ am I less guilty in your	308:329,32S  !
2S	opinion than I was before? ~ My intentions were not	308:329,33S  !
2S	always wrong.  Have I explained away any part of my	308:329,34S  !
2S	guilt?"	308:329,35S  !
2A	"Yes, you have certainly removed something ~ a little.	308:329,36A  !
2A	~ You have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty	308:329,37A  !
2A	than I had believed you.  You have proved your heart	308:329,38A  !
2A	less wicked, much less wicked.  But I hardly know ~	308:330, 1A  !
2A	the misery that you have inflicted ~ I hardly know what	308:330, 2A  !
2A	could have made it worse."	308:330, 3A  !
2S	"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered,	308:330, 4S  !
2S	what I have been telling you? ~ Let me be a little	308:330, 5S  !
2S	lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours.  You	308:330, 6S  !
2S	tell me that she has forgiven me already.  Let me be	308:330, 7S  !
2S	able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and	308:330, 8S  !
2S	of my present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous,	308:330, 9S  !
2S	more natural, more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.	308:330,10S  !
2S	Tell her of my misery and my penitence ~ tell her	308:330,11S  !
2S	that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if you	308:330,12S  !
2S	will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever."	308:330,13S  !
2A	"I will tell her all that is necessary to what may	308:330,14A  !
2A	comparatively be called, your justification.  But you	308:330,15A  !
2A	have not explained to me the particular reason of your	308:330,16A  !
2A	coming now, nor how you heard of her illness."	308:330,17A  !
2S	"Last night, in Drury-lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton,	308:330,18S  !
2S	and when he saw who I was ~ for the	308:330,19S  !
2S	first time these two months ~ he spoke to me. ~ That he	308:330,20S  !
2S	had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without	308:330,21S  !
2S	surprise or resentment.  Now, however, his good-natured,	308:330,22S  !
2S	honest, stupid soul, full of indignation against	308:330,23S  !
2S	me, and concern for your sister, could not resist the	308:330,24S  !
2S	temptation of telling me what he knew ought to ~ though	308:330,25S  !
2S	probably he did not think it \would\ ~ vex me horridly. ~	308:330,26S  !
2S	As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that	308:330,27S  !
2S	Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland ~	308:330,28S  !
2S	a letter that morning received from Mrs% Jennings	308:330,29S  !
2S	declared her danger most imminent ~ the Palmers all	308:330,30S  !
2S	gone off in a fright, &c% ~ I was too much shocked to	308:330,31S  !
2S	be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the	308:330,32S  !
2S	undiscerning Sir John.  His heart was softened in seeing	308:330,33S  !
2S	mine suffer; and so much of his ill-will was done away,	308:330,34S  !
2S	that when we parted, he almost shook me by the hand	308:330,35S  !
2S	while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer	308:330,36S  !
2S	puppy.  What I felt on hearing that your sister was	308:330,37S  !
2S	dying ~ and dying too, believing me the greatest villain	308:330,38S  !
2S	upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest moments ~	308:331, 1S  !
2S	for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have	308:331, 2S  !
2S	been imputed?  \One\ person I was sure would represent	308:331, 3S  !
2S	me as capable of anything ~ what I felt was dreadful| ~	308:331, 4S  !
2S	My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock	308:331, 5S  !
2S	this morning I was in my carriage.  Now you know	308:331, 6S  !
2S	all."	308:331, 7S  !

2S	from thence to town in a day or two.  Good bye."	308:331,35S  !
2S	"And you \do\ think something better of me than you	308:331,38S  !
2S	did?" ~	308:332, 1S  !
2S	"As to that,"	308:332, 8S  !
2S	"I must rub through the world	308:332, 8S  !
2S	as well as I can.  Domestic happiness is out of the	308:332, 9S  !
2S	question.  If, however, I am allowed to think that you	308:332,10S  !
2S	and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it may	308:332,11S  !
2S	be the means ~ it may put me on my guard ~ at least, it	308:332,12S  !
2S	will be something to live for.  Marianne to be sure is	308:332,13S  !

2S	I could least bear ~~ But I will not stay to rob myself	308:332,25S  !
2S	of all your compassionate good-will, by shewing that	308:332,26S  !

2D	I, you may well believe, could talk of nothing	309:336,22D  !
2D	but my child; ~ he could not conceal his distress; I saw	309:336,23D  !
2D	that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that	309:336,24D  !
2D	mere friendship, as the world now goes, would not justify	309:336,25D  !
2D	so warm a sympathy ~ or rather not thinking at all, I	309:336,26D  !

2A	prompted him.  To Mrs% Jennings, to the Middletons,	309:337,16A  !

2D	the same time, there is something much more pleasing	309:338,15D  !
2D	in his countenance. ~ There was always a something, ~	309:338,16D  !

2D	they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching	309:338,23D  !

2D	attention to other people, and their manly unstudied	309:338,25D  !
2D	simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition,	309:338,26D  !

2D	of the other.  I am very sure myself, that had	309:338,28D  !
2D	Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has	309:338,29D  !

2C	walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton-Cross, and	310:343,11C  !
2C	the Abbeyland; and we will often go to the old ruins of	310:343,12C  !

2C	I know the summer will pass happily away.  I mean	310:343,15C  !

2C	till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and	310:343,17C  !
2C	reading.  I have formed my plan, and am determined	310:343,18C  !
2C	to enter on a course of serious study.  Our own library	310:343,19C  !

2C	more modern production which I know I can borrow	310:343,23C  !
2C	of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six hours a-day,	310:343,24C  !

2C	my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know	310:345,24C  !
2C	your judgment must censure.  My illness has made me	310:345,25C  !
2C	think ~ It has given me leisure and calmness for serious	310:345,26C  !
2C	recollection.  Long before I was enough recovered to	310:345,27C  !
2C	talk, I was perfectly able to reflect.  I considered the	310:345,28C  !
2C	past; I saw in my own behaviour since the beginning	310:345,29C  !
2C	of our acquaintance with him last autumn, nothing	310:345,30C  !
2C	but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want	310:345,31C  !
2C	of kindness to others.  I saw that my own feelings had	310:345,32C  !
2C	prepared my sufferings, and that my want of fortitude	310:345,33C  !
2C	under them had almost led me to the grave.  My illness,	310:345,34C  !
2C	I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself,	310:345,35C  !
2C	by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even	310:345,36C  !
2C	at the time to be wrong.  Had I died, ~ it would have	310:345,37C  !
2C	been self-destruction.  I did not know my danger till	310:345,38C  !
2C	the danger was removed; but with such feelings as	310:346, 1C  !
2C	these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery, ~	310:346, 2C  !
2C	wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to	310:346, 3C  !
2C	have time for atonement to my God, and to you all, did	310:346, 4C  !
2C	not kill me at once.  Had I died, ~ in what peculiar	310:346, 5C  !
2C	misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my	310:346, 6C  !
2C	sister| ~ You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness	310:346, 7C  !
2C	of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings	310:346, 8C  !
2C	of my heart| ~ How should I have lived in \your\ remembrance|	310:346, 9C  !
2C	~ My mother too|  How could you have consoled	310:346,10C  !
2C	her| ~ I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.	310:346,11C  !
2C	Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty	310:346,12C  !
2C	neglected, or some failing indulged.  Every body seemed	310:346,13C  !
2C	injured by me.  The kindness, the unceasing kindness	310:346,14C  !
2C	of Mrs% Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.	310:346,15C  !
2C	To the Middletons, the Palmers, the Steeles, to every	310:346,16C  !
2C	common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and	310:346,17C  !
2C	unjust; with an heart hardened against their merits,	310:346,18C  !
2C	and a temper irritated by their very attention. ~ To	310:346,19C  !
2C	John, to Fanny, ~ yes, even to them, little as they	310:346,20C  !
2C	deserve, I had given less than their due.  But you, ~	310:346,21C  !
2C	you above all, above my mother, had been wronged by	310:346,22C  !
2C	me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;	310:346,23C  !
2C	yet, to what did it influence me? ~ not to any compassion	310:346,24C  !
2C	that could benefit you or myself. ~ Your example was	310:346,25C  !
2C	before me:  but to what avail? ~ Was I more considerate	310:346,26C  !
2C	of you and your comfort?  Did I imitate your	310:346,27C  !
2C	forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any	310:346,28C  !
2C	part in those offices of general complaisance or particular	310:346,29C  !
2C	gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge	310:346,30C  !
2C	alone? ~ No; ~ not less when I knew you to be unhappy,	310:346,31C  !
2C	than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away	310:346,32C  !
2C	from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely	310:346,33C  !
2C	allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only	310:346,34C  !
2C	\that\ heart which had deserted and wronged me, and	310:346,35C  !
2C	leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection,	310:346,36C  !
2C	to be miserable for my sake."	310:346,37C  !
2C	"You are very good. ~ The future must be my proof.	310:347, 5C  !
2C	I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of	310:347, 6C  !
2C	adhering to it ~ my feelings shall be governed and my	310:347, 7C  !
2C	temper improved.  They shall no longer worry others,	310:347, 8C  !
2C	nor torture myself.  I shall now live solely for my family.	310:347, 9C  !
2C	You, my mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all	310:347,10C  !
2C	the world to me; you will share my affections entirely	310:347,11C  !
2C	between you.  From you, from my home, I shall never	310:347,12C  !
2C	again have the smallest incitement to move; and if	310:347,13C  !
2C	I do mix in other society it will be only to shew that my	310:347,14C  !
2C	spirit is humbled, my heart amended, and that I can	310:347,15C  !
2C	practise the civilities, the lesser duties of life, with	310:347,16C  !
2C	gentleness, and forbearance.  As for Willoughby ~ to	310:347,17C  !
2C	say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him,	310:347,18C  !
2C	would be idle.  His remembrance can be overcome by	310:347,19C  !
2C	no change of circumstances or opinions.  But it shall	310:347,20C  !
2C	be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,	310:347,21C  !
2C	by constant employment."	310:347,22C  !

2A	enough to be convinced that your marriage must have	311:350,27A  !

2D	pressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised to	312:358,16D  !

2A	"He comes from Mr% Pratt's purposely	312:358,29A  !

2B	youngest ~ to Miss Lucy Steele."	312:360,18B  !

2B	"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,"	313:362, 8B  !
2B	"the consequence of ignorance of the world ~ and	313:362, 9B  !
2B	want of employment.  Had my mother given me some	313:362,10B  !
2B	active profession when I was removed at eighteen from	313:362,11B  !
2B	the care of Mr% Pratt, I think ~ nay, I am sure, it would	313:362,12B  !
2B	never have happened; for though I left Longstaple	313:362,13B  !
2B	with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable	313:362,14B  !
2B	preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit,	313:362,15B  !
2B	any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance	313:362,16B  !
2B	from her for a few months, I should very soon have	313:362,17B  !
2B	outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing	313:362,18B  !
2B	more with the world, as in such a case I must have done.	313:362,19B  !
2B	But instead of having anything to do, instead of having	313:362,20B  !
2B	any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse	313:362,21B  !
2B	any myself, I returned home to be completely idle;	313:362,22B  !
2B	and for the first twelvemonth afterwards, I had not	313:362,23B  !
2B	even the nominal employment, which belonging to	313:362,24B  !
2B	the university would have given me, for I was not	313:362,25B  !
2B	entered at Oxford till I was nineteen.  I had therefore	313:362,26B  !
2B	nothing in the world to do, but to fancy myself in love;	313:362,27B  !
2B	and as my mother did not make my home in every	313:362,28B  !
2B	respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion	313:362,29B  !
2B	in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was	313:362,30B  !
2B	not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple,	313:362,31B  !
2B	where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure	313:362,32B  !
2B	of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part	313:362,33B  !
2B	of my time there from eighteen to nineteen:  Lucy	313:362,34B  !
2B	appeared everything that was amiable and obliging.	313:362,35B  !
2B	She was pretty too ~ at least I thought so \then\, and I had	313:362,36B  !
2B	seen so little of other women, that I could make no	313:362,37B  !
2B	comparisons, and see no defects.  Considering everything,	313:362,38B  !
2B	therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as	313:362,39B  !
2B	it has since in every way been proved, it was not at the	313:363, 1B  !
2B	time an unnatural, or an inexcusable piece of folly."	313:363, 2B  !

2B	them first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might think	313:364,30B  !

2Q	Being very sure I have long lost your affections,	313:365, 7Q  !
2Q	I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on	313:365, 8Q  !
2Q	another, and have no doubt of being as happy with him	313:365, 9Q  !
2Q	as I once used to think I might be with you; but I scorn	313:365,10Q  !
2Q	to accept a hand while the heart was another's.  Sincerely	313:365,11Q  !
2Q	wish you happy in your choice, and it shall not be my fault	313:365,12Q  !
2Q	if we are not always good friends, as our near relationship	313:365,13Q  !
2Q	now makes proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,	313:365,14Q  !
2Q	and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill	313:365,15Q  !
2Q	offices.  Your brother has gained my affections entirely,	313:365,16Q  !
2Q	and as we could not live without one another, we are	313:365,17Q  !
2Q	just returned from the altar, and are now on our way to	313:365,18Q  !
2Q	Dawlish for a few weeks, which place your dear brother	313:365,19Q  !
2Q	has great curiosity to see, but thought I would first	313:365,20Q  !
2Q	trouble you with these few lines, and shall always remain,	313:365,21Q  !
2Q	Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,	313:365,22Q  !
2Q	LUCY FERRARS.	313:365,23Q  !

2Q	picture the first opportunity.  Please to destroy my	313:365,25Q  !
2Q	scrawls ~ but the ring with my hair you are very welcome	313:365,26Q  !
2Q	to keep."	313:365,27Q  !
2B	"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,"	313:365,30B  !
2B	"For worlds would not I have had	313:365,31B  !
2B	a letter of her's seen by \you\ in former days. ~ In a sister	313:365,32B  !
2B	it is bad enough, but in a wife| ~ how I have blushed	313:365,33B  !
2B	over the pages of her writing| ~ and I believe I may	313:365,34B  !
2B	say that since the first half year of our foolish ~ business	313:365,35B  !
2B	~ this is the only letter I ever received from her, of which	313:365,36B  !

2B	style."	313:365,38B  !
2A	"However it may have come about,"	313:366, 1A  !
2A	"they are certainly married.  And your	313:366, 2A  !
2A	mother has brought on herself a most appropriate	313:366, 3A  !
2A	punishment.  The independence she settled on Robert,	313:366, 4A  !
2A	through resentment against you, has put it in his power	313:366, 5A  !
2A	to make his own choice; and she has actually been	313:366, 6A  !
2A	bribing one son with a thousand a-year, to do the very	313:366, 7A  !
2A	deed which she disinherited the other for intending to	313:366, 8A  !
2A	do.  She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert's	313:366, 9A  !
2A	marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your	313:366,10A  !
2A	marrying her."	313:366,11A  !
2B	"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was	313:366,12B  !
2B	her favourite. ~ She will be more hurt by it, and on the	313:366,13B  !
2B	same principle will forgive him much sooner."	313:366,14B  !

2B	"independent of	313:367,12B  !

2B	and stood to all appearance without a friend in the	313:367,15B  !
2B	world to assist me.  In such a situation as that, where	313:367,16B  !
2B	there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity	313:367,17B  !
2B	of any living creature, how could I suppose, when she	313:367,18B  !
2B	so earnestly, so warmly insisted on sharing my fate,	313:367,19B  !
2B	whatever it might be, that any thing but the most	313:367,20B  !
2B	disinterested affection was her inducement?  And	313:367,21B  !
2B	even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she	313:367,22B  !
2B	acted, or what fancied advantage it could be to her, to	313:367,23B  !
2B	be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest	313:367,24B  !
2B	regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the	313:367,25B  !
2B	world.  She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon	313:367,26B  !
2B	would give me a living."	313:367,27B  !
2A	"No, but she might suppose that something would	313:367,28A  !
2A	occur in your favour; that your own family might in time	313:367,29A  !
2A	relent.  And at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing	313:367,30A  !
2A	the engagement, for she has proved that it fettered	313:367,31A  !
2A	neither her inclination nor her actions.  The connection	313:367,32A  !
2A	was certainly a respectable one, and probably gained	313:367,33A  !
2A	her consideration among her friends; and, if nothing	313:367,34A  !
2A	more advantageous occurred, it would be better for her	313:367,35A  !
2A	to marry \you\ than be single."	313:367,36A  !

2A	"because ~ to say nothing of my own conviction, our	313:368, 6A  !

2A	\what\, as you were \then\ situated, could never be."	313:368, 8A  !
2B	"I was simple enough to think, that because my \faith\	313:368,11B  !

2B	engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as	313:368,14B  !
2B	my honour.  I felt that I admired you, but I told myself	313:368,15B  !
2B	it was only friendship; and till I began to make comparisons	313:368,16B  !
2B	between yourself and Lucy, I did not know how	313:368,17B  !
2B	far I was got.  After that, I suppose, I \was\ wrong in	313:368,18B  !
2B	remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with	313:368,19B  !
2B	which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were	313:368,20B  !
2B	no better than these: ~ The danger is my own; I am	313:368,21B  !

2K	after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs% Ferrars, as well	313:370,33K  !
2K	as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it	313:370,34K  !
2K	seems borrowed all her money before she went off to	313:370,35K  !
2K	be married, on purpose we suppose to make a shew with,	313:370,36K  !
2K	and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world; ~	313:370,37K  !

2K	four weeks with Mrs% Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to	313:371, 1K  !

2K	Lucy's crossness not to take her along with them in the	313:371, 3K  !

3C	"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty	101:  4,19C  !
3C	to think of."	101:  4,20C  !
3D	"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr% Bingley	101:  4,21D  !
3D	when he comes into the neighbourhood."	101:  4,22D  !
3C	"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."	101:  4,23C  !
3D	"But consider your daughters.  Only think what an	101:  4,24D  !
3D	establishment it would be for one of them.  Sir William	101:  4,25D  !
3D	and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that	101:  4,26D  !
3D	account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	101:  4,27D  !
3D	Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to	101:  4,28D  !
3D	visit him, if you do not."	101:  4,29D  !
3C	"You are over scrupulous surely.  I dare say Mr% Bingley	101:  4,30C  !
3C	will be very glad to see you; and I will send	101:  4,31C  !
3C	a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent	101:  4,32C  !
3C	to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though	101:  4,33C  !
3C	I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."	101:  4,34C  !
3D	"I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not	101:  4,35D  !
3D	a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half	101:  4,36D  !
3D	so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.	101:  4,37D  !
3D	But you are always giving \her\ the preference."	101:  4,38D  !
3C	"They have none of them much to recommend them,"	101:  5, 1C  !
3C	"they are all silly and ignorant like other	101:  5, 2C  !
3C	girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness	101:  5, 3C  !
3C	than her sisters."	101:  5, 4C  !
3D	"Mr% Bennet, how can you abuse your own children	101:  5, 5D  !
3D	in such a way?  You take delight in vexing me.  You	101:  5, 6D  !
3D	have no compassion on my poor nerves."	101:  5, 7D  !
3C	"You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for	101:  5, 8C  !
3C	your nerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you	101:  5, 9C  !
3C	mention them with consideration these twenty years at	101:  5,10C  !
3C	least."	101:  5,11C  !
3D	"Ah| you do not know what I suffer."	101:  5,12D  !
3C	"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many	101:  5,13C  !
3C	young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	101:  5,14C  !
3D	"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come	101:  5,16D  !
3D	since you will not visit them."	101:  5,17D  !
3C	"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty,	101:  5,18C  !
3C	I will visit them all."	101:  5,19C  !
3C	"I hope Mr% Bingley will like it Lizzy."	102:  6, 8C  !
3D	"We are not in a way to know \what\ Mr% Bingley likes,"	102:  6, 9D  !
3D	"since we are not to visit."	102:  6,10D  !
3A	"But you forget, mama,"	102:  6,11A  !
3A	"that we	102:  6,11A  !
3A	shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs% Long has	102:  6,12A  !
3A	promised to introduce him."	102:  6,13A  !
3D	"I do not believe Mrs% Long will do any such thing.	102:  6,14D  !
3D	She has two neices of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical	102:  6,15D  !
3D	woman, and I have no opinion of her."	102:  6,16D  !
3C	"No more have I,"	102:  6,17C  !
3C	"and I am glad	102:  6,17C  !
3C	to find that you do not depend on her serving you."	102:  6,18C  !
3D	"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake|	102:  6,22D  !
3D	Have a little compassion on my nerves.  You tear them	102:  6,23D  !
3D	to pieces."	102:  6,24D  !
3C	"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,"	102:  6,25C  !
3C	"she times them ill."	102:  6,26C  !
3C	"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"	102:  6,29C  !
3A	"To-morrow fortnight."	102:  6,30A  !
3D	"Aye, so it is,"	102:  6,31D  !
3D	"and Mrs% Long	102:  6,31D  !
3D	does not come back till the day before; so, it will be	102:  6,32D  !
3D	impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know	102:  6,33D  !
3D	him herself."	102:  6,34D  !
3C	"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your	102:  7, 1C  !
3C	friend, and introduce Mr% Bingley to \her\."	102:  7, 2C  !
3D	"Impossible, Mr% Bennet, impossible, when I am	102:  7, 3D  !
3D	not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so	102:  7, 4D  !
3D	teazing?"	102:  7, 5D  !
3C	"I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight's acquaintance	102:  7, 6C  !
3C	is certainly very little.  One cannot know what	102:  7, 7C  !
3C	a man really is by the end of a fortnight.  But if \we\ do	102:  7, 8C  !
3C	not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs% Long	102:  7, 9C  !
3C	and her neices must stand their chance; and therefore,	102:  7,10C  !
3C	as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the	102:  7,11C  !
3C	office, I will take it on myself."	102:  7,12C  !
3D	"Nonsense, nonsense|"	102:  7,14D  !
3C	"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	102:  7,15C  !
3C	"Do you consider the forms of introduction,	102:  7,16C  !
3C	and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?	102:  7,17C  !
3C	I cannot quite agree with you \there\.  What say you,	102:  7,18C  !
3C	Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know,	102:  7,19C  !
3C	and read great books, and make extracts."	102:  7,20C  !
3C	"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,"	102:  7,23C  !
3C	"let us return to Mr% Bingley."	102:  7,24C  !
3D	"I am sick of Mr% Bingley,"	102:  7,25D  !
3C	"I am sorry to hear \that\; but why did not you tell	102:  7,26C  !
3C	me so before?  If I had known as much this morning,	102:  7,27C  !
3C	I certainly would not have called on him.  It is very	102:  7,28C  !
3C	unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot	102:  7,29C  !
3C	escape the acquaintance now."	102:  7,30C  !
3D	"How good it was in you, my dear Mr% Bennet|  But	102:  7,35D  !
3D	I knew I should persuade you at last.  I was sure you	102:  7,36D  !
3D	loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.	102:  7,37D  !
3D	Well, how pleased I am| and it is such a good joke, too,	102:  7,38D  !
3D	that you should have gone this morning, and never said	102:  8, 1D  !
3D	a word about it till now."	102:  8, 2D  !
3C	"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,"	102:  8, 3C  !
3D	"What an excellent father you have, girls,"	102:  8, 6D  !
3D	"I do not know how you will	102:  8, 7D  !
3D	ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either,	102:  8, 8D  !
3D	for that matter.  At our time of life, it is not so pleasant	102:  8, 9D  !
3D	I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day;	102:  8,10D  !
3D	but for your sakes, we would do any thing.  Lydia, my	102:  8,11D  !
3D	love, though you \are\ the youngest, I dare say Mr% Bingley	102:  8,12D  !
3D	will dance with you at the next ball."	102:  8,13D  !
3H	"Oh|"	102:  8,14H  !
3H	"I am not afraid; for	102:  8,14H  !
3H	though I \am\ the youngest, I'm the tallest."	102:  8,15H  !
3D	"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled	103:  9,16D  !
3D	at Netherfield,"	103:  9,17D  !
3D	"and	103:  9,17D  !
3D	all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing	103:  9,18D  !
3D	to wish for."	103:  9,19D  !
3B	"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it,	103: 11,22B  !
3B	unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.  At	103: 11,23B  !
3B	such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	103: 11,24B  !
3B	Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman	103: 11,25B  !
3B	in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me	103: 11,26B  !
3B	to stand up with."	103: 11,27B  !
3B	"\You\ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the	103: 11,32B  !
3B	room,"	103: 11,33B  !
3B	"Which do you mean?"	103: 11,38B  !
3B	"She is tolerable; but not	103: 12, 2B  !
3B	handsome enough to tempt \me\; and I am in no humour	103: 12, 3B  !
3B	at present to give consequence to young ladies who are	103: 12, 4B  !
3B	slighted by other men.  You had better return to your	103: 12, 5B  !
3B	partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your	103: 12, 6B  !
3B	time with me."	103: 12, 7B  !
3D	"Oh| my dear Mr% Bennet,"	103: 12,33D  !
3D	"we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent	103: 12,34D  !
3D	ball.  I wish you had been there.  Jane was so admired,	103: 12,35D  !
3D	nothing could be like it.  Every body said how well she	103: 12,36D  !
3D	looked; and Mr% Bingley thought her quite beautiful,	103: 12,37D  !
3D	and danced with her twice.  Only think of \that\ my dear;	103: 12,38D  !
3D	he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only	103: 13, 1D  !
3D	creature in the room that he asked a second time.  First	103: 13, 2D  !
3D	of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him	103: 13, 3D  !
3D	stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her	103: 13, 4D  !
3D	at all:  indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed	103: 13, 5D  !
3D	quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.	103: 13, 6D  !
3D	So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked	103: 13, 7D  !
3D	her for the two next.  Then, the two third he danced with	103: 13, 8D  !
3D	Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the	103: 13, 9D  !
3D	two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy,	103: 13,10D  !
3D	and the Boulanger ~~"	103: 13,11D  !
3C	"If he had had any compassion for \me\,"	103: 13,12C  !
3C	"he would not have danced half	103: 13,14C  !
3C	so much|  For God's sake, say no more of his partners.	103: 13,15C  !
3C	Oh| that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance|"	103: 13,16C  !
3D	"Oh| my dear,"	103: 13,17D  !
3D	"I am quite	103: 13,17D  !
3D	delighted with him.  He is so excessively handsome| and	103: 13,18D  !
3D	his sisters are charming women.  I never in my life saw	103: 13,19D  !
3D	any thing more elegant than their dresses.  I dare say the	103: 13,20D  !
3D	lace upon Mrs% Hurst's gown ~~"	103: 13,21D  !
3D	"But I can assure you,"	103: 13,27D  !
3D	"that Lizzy does	103: 13,27D  !
3D	not lose much by not suiting \his\ fancy; for he is a most	103: 13,28D  !
3D	disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So	103: 13,29D  !
3D	high and so conceited that there was no enduring him|	103: 13,30D  !
3D	He walked here, and walked there, fancying himself	103: 13,31D  !
3D	so very great|  Not handsome enough to dance with|	103: 13,32D  !
3D	I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him	103: 13,33D  !
3D	one of your set downs.  I quite detest the man."	103: 13,34D  !
3E	"He is just what a young man ought to be,"	104: 14, 4E  !
3E	"sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such	104: 14, 5E  !
3E	happy manners| ~ so much ease, with such perfect good breeding|"	104: 14, 6E  !
3A	"He is also handsome,"	104: 14, 8A  !
3A	"which	104: 14, 8A  !
3A	a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	104: 14, 9A  !
3A	His character is thereby complete."	104: 14,10A  !
3E	"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance	104: 14,11E  !
3E	a second time.  I did not expect such a compliment."	104: 14,12E  !
3A	"Did not you?  \I\ did for you.  But that is one great	104: 14,13A  !
3A	difference between us.  Compliments always take \you\ by	104: 14,14A  !
3A	surprise, and \me\ never.  What could be more natural than	104: 14,15A  !
3A	his asking you again?  He could not help seeing that you	104: 14,16A  !
3A	were about five times as pretty as every other woman in	104: 14,17A  !
3A	the room.  No thanks to his gallantry for that.  Well,	104: 14,18A  !
3A	he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to	104: 14,19A  !
3A	like him.  You have liked many a stupider person."	104: 14,20A  !
3E	"Dear Lizzy|"	104: 14,21E  !
3A	"Oh| you are a great deal too apt you know, to like	104: 14,22A  !
3A	people in general.  You never see a fault in any body.	104: 14,23A  !
3A	All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.  I never	104: 14,24A  !
3A	heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	104: 14,25A  !
3E	"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one;	104: 14,26E  !
3E	but I always speak what I think."	104: 14,27E  !
3A	"I know you do; and it is \that\ which makes the wonder.	104: 14,28A  !
3A	With \your\ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies	104: 14,29A  !
3A	and nonsense of others|  Affectation of candour is common	104: 14,30A  !
3A	enough; ~ one meets it every where.  But to be candid	104: 14,31A  !
3A	without ostentation or design ~ to take the good of every body's	104: 14,32A  !
3A	character and make it still better, and say nothing	104: 14,33A  !
3A	of the bad ~ belongs to you alone.  And so, you like this	104: 15, 1A  !
3A	man's sisters too, do you?  Their manners are not equal	104: 15, 2A  !
3A	to his."	104: 15, 3A  !
3E	"Certainly not; at first.  But they are very pleasing	104: 15, 4E  !
3E	women when you converse with them.  Miss Bingley	104: 15, 5E  !
3E	is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am	104: 15, 6E  !
3E	much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming	104: 15, 7E  !
3E	neighbour in her."	104: 15, 8E  !
3D	"\You\ began the evening well, Charlotte,"	105: 18,27D  !
3D	"\You\	105: 18,28D  !
3D	were Mr% Bingley's first choice."	105: 18,29D  !
3D	"Oh| ~ you mean Jane, I suppose ~ because he danced	105: 18,31D  !
3D	with her twice.  To be sure that \did\ seem as if he admired	105: 18,32D  !
3D	her ~ indeed I rather believe he \did\ ~ I heard something	105: 18,33D  !
3D	about it ~ but I hardly know what ~ something about	105: 19, 1D  !
3D	Mr% Robinson."	105: 19, 2D  !
3D	"Upon my word| ~ Well, that was very decided indeed	105: 19,11D  !
3D	~ that does seem as if ~ but however, it may all come	105: 19,12D  !
3D	to nothing you know."	105: 19,13D  !
3D	"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to	105: 19,18D  !
3D	be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable	105: 19,19D  !
3D	man that it would be quite a misfortune to be	105: 19,20D  !
3D	liked by him.  Mrs% Long told me last night that he	105: 19,21D  !
3D	sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his	105: 19,22D  !
3D	lips."	105: 19,23D  !
3E	"Are you quite sure, Ma'am? ~ is not there a little	105: 19,24E  !
3E	mistake?"	105: 19,25E  !
3E	"I certainly saw Mr% Darcy	105: 19,25E  !
3E	speaking to her."	105: 19,26E  !
3D	"Aye ~ because she asked him at last how he liked	105: 19,27D  !
3D	Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; ~ but	105: 19,28D  !
3D	she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to."	105: 19,29D  !
3E	"Miss Bingley told me,"	105: 19,30E  !
3E	"that he never	105: 19,30E  !
3E	speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	105: 19,31E  !
3E	With \them\ he is remarkably agreeable."	105: 19,32E  !
3D	"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been	105: 19,33D  !
3D	so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs% Long.	105: 19,34D  !
3D	But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is	105: 19,35D  !
3D	ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow	105: 19,36D  !
3D	that Mrs% Long does not keep a carriage, and had come	105: 19,37D  !
3D	to the ball in a hack chaise."	105: 19,38D  !
3D	"Another time, Lizzy,"	105: 20, 3D  !
3D	"I would not	105: 20, 3D  !
3D	dance with \him\, if I were you."	105: 20, 4D  !
3A	"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you \never\ to	105: 20, 5A  !
3A	dance with him."	105: 20, 6A  !
3A	"That is very true,"	105: 20,13A  !
3A	"and I could	105: 20,13A  !
3A	easily forgive \his\ pride, if he had not mortified \mine\."	105: 20,14A  !
3D	"Then you would drink a great deal more than you	105: 20,31D  !
3D	ought,"	105: 20,32D  !
3D	"and if I were to see you at	105: 20,34D  !
3D	it I should take away your bottle directly."	105: 20,35D  !
3A	"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will	106: 22, 6A  !
3A	allow.  If \I\ can perceived her regard for him, he must be	106: 22, 7A  !
3A	a simpleton indeed not to discover it too."	106: 22, 8A  !
3A	"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not	106: 22,11A  !
3A	endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."	106: 22,12A  !
3A	"Your plan is a good one,"	106: 22,22A  !
3A	"where	106: 22,22A  !
3A	nothing is in question but the desire of being well married;	106: 22,23A  !
3A	and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any	106: 22,24A  !
3A	husband, I dare say I should adopt it.  But these are	106: 22,25A  !
3A	not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.  As yet,	106: 22,26A  !
3A	she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own	106: 22,27A  !
3A	regard, nor of its reasonableness.  She has known him only	106: 22,28A  !
3A	a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him at Meryton;	106: 22,29A  !
3A	she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since	106: 22,30A  !
3A	dined in company with him four times.  This is not quite	106: 22,31A  !
3A	enough to make her understand his character."	106: 22,32A  !
3A	"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to	106: 22,38A  !
3A	ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce;	106: 23, 1A  !
3A	but with respect to any other leading characteristic,	106: 23, 2A  !
3A	I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	106: 23, 3A  !
3A	"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	106: 23,16A  !
3A	You know it is not sound, and that you would never	106: 23,17A  !
3A	act in this way yourself."	106: 23,18A  !
3A	"What does Mr% Darcy mean,"	106: 24, 6A  !
3A	"by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"	106: 24, 7A  !
3A	"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him	106: 24, 9A  !
3A	know that I see what he is about.  He has a very satirical	106: 24,10A  !
3A	eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself,	106: 24,11A  !
3A	I shall soon grow afraid of him."	106: 24,12A  !
3A	"Did not you think, Mr% Darcy, that I expressed myself	106: 24,18A  !
3A	uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster	106: 24,19A  !
3A	to give us a ball at Meryton?"	106: 24,20A  !
3B	"With great energy; ~ but it is a subject which always	106: 24,21B  !
3B	makes a lady energetic."	106: 24,22B  !
3A	"You are severe on us."	106: 24,23A  !
3A	"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend| ~	106: 24,27A  !
3A	always wanting me to play and sing before any body and	106: 24,28A  !
3A	every body| ~ If my vanity had taken a musical turn,	106: 24,29A  !
3A	you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would	106: 24,30A  !
3A	really rather not sit down before those who must be in	106: 24,31A  !
3A	the habit of hearing the very best performers."	106: 24,32A  !
3A	"Very well;	106: 24,33A  !
3A	if it must be so, it must."	106: 24,34A  !
3A	"There is a fine old saying, which every body	106: 24,35A  !
3A	here is of course familiar with ~ ""Keep your breath to cool	106: 24,36A  !
3A	your porridge,"" ~ and I shall keep mine to swell my	106: 24,37A  !
3A	song."	106: 24,38A  !
3B	"Certainly, Sir; ~ and it has the advantage also of	106: 25,28B  !
3B	being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the	106: 25,29B  !
3B	world. ~ Every savage can dance."	106: 25,30B  !
3B	"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."	106: 25,35B  !
3B	"Never, sir."	106: 25,38B  !
3B	"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place	106: 26, 3B  !
3B	if I can avoid it."	106: 26, 4B  !
3A	"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. ~	106: 26,23A  !
3A	I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in	106: 26,24A  !
3A	order to beg for a partner."	106: 26,25A  !
3A	"Mr% Darcy is all politeness,"	106: 26,34A  !
3J	"I can guess the subject of your reverie."	106: 27, 4J  !
3B	"I should imagine not."	106: 27, 5B  !
3J	"You are considering how insupportable it would be	106: 27, 6J  !
3J	to pass many evenings in this manner ~ in such society;	106: 27, 7J  !
3J	and indeed I am quite of your opinion.  I was never	106: 27, 8J  !
3J	more annoyed|  The insipidity and yet the noise; the	106: 27, 9J  !
3J	nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these	106: 27,10J  !
3J	people| ~ What would I give to hear your strictures on	106: 27,11J  !
3J	them|"	106: 27,12J  !
3B	"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My	106: 27,13B  !
3B	mind was more agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating	106: 27,14B  !
3B	on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes	106: 27,15B  !
3B	in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	106: 27,16B  !
3B	"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."	106: 27,21B  !
3J	"Miss Elizabeth Bennet|"	106: 27,22J  !
3J	"I am all astonishment.  How long has she been such	106: 27,23J  !
3J	a favourite? ~ and pray when am I to wish you joy?"	106: 27,24J  !
3B	"That is exactly the question which I expected you	106: 27,25B  !
3B	to ask.  A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps	106: 27,26B  !
3B	from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a	106: 27,27B  !
3B	moment.  I knew you would be wishing me joy."	106: 27,28B  !
3J	"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider	106: 27,29J  !
3J	the matter as absolutely settled.  You will have a charming	106: 27,30J  !
3J	mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always	106: 27,31J  !
3J	at Pemberley with you."	106: 27,32J  !
3C	"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking,	107: 29, 8C  !
3C	you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.  I have	107: 29, 9C  !
3C	suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."	107: 29,10C  !
3D	"I am astonished, my dear,"	107: 29,16D  !
3D	"that	107: 29,16D  !
3D	you should be so ready to think your own children silly.	107: 29,17D  !
3D	If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children,	107: 29,18D  !
3D	it should not be of my own however."	107: 29,19D  !
3C	"If my children are silly I must hope to be always	107: 29,20C  !
3C	sensible of it."	107: 29,21C  !
3D	"Yes ~ but as it happens, they are all of them very	107: 29,22D  !
3D	clever."	107: 29,23D  !
3C	"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we	107: 29,24C  !
3C	do not agree.  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided	107: 29,25C  !
3C	in every particular, but I must so far differ from you	107: 29,26C  !
3C	as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly	107: 29,27C  !
3C	foolish."	107: 29,28C  !
3D	"My dear Mr% Bennet, you must not expect such girls	107: 29,29D  !
3D	to have the sense of their father and mother. ~ When	107: 29,30D  !
3D	they get to our age I dare say they will not think about	107: 29,31D  !
3D	officers any more than we do.  I remember the time when	107: 29,32D  !
3D	I liked a red coat myself very well ~ and indeed so I do	107: 29,33D  !
3D	still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with	107: 29,34D  !
3D	five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls,	107: 29,35D  !
3D	I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster	107: 29,36D  !
3D	looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in	107: 29,37D  !
3D	his regimentals."	107: 29,38D  !
3H	"Mama,"	107: 30, 1H  !
3H	"my aunt says that Colonel Forster	107: 30, 1H  !
3H	and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's	107: 30, 2H  !
3H	as they did when they first came; she sees	107: 30, 3H  !
3H	them now very often standing in Clarke's library."	107: 30, 4H  !
3D	"Well, Jane, who is it from?  what is it about?  what	107: 30,10D  !
3D	does he say?  Well, Jane make haste and tell us; make	107: 30,11D  !
3D	haste, my love."	107: 30,12D  !
3E	"It is from Miss Bingley,"	107: 30,13E  !
3J	"My dear Friend,	107: 30,16J  !
3J	"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day	107: 30,17J  !
3J	with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each	107: 30,18J  !
3J	other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's te~te-a`-te~te	107: 30,19J  !
3J	between two women can never end without a quarrel.	107: 30,20J  !
3J	Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.  My	107: 30,21J  !
3J	brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	107: 30,22J  !
3J	Yours ever,	107: 30,23J  !
3J	"CAROLINE BINGLEY."	107: 30,24J  !
3H	"With the officers|"	107: 30,26H  !
3H	"I wonder my	107: 30,26H  !
3H	aunt did not tell us of \that\."	107: 30,27H  !
3D	"Dining out,"	107: 30,28D  !
3D	"that is very unlucky."	107: 30,28D  !
3E	"Can I have the carriage?"	107: 30,30E  !
3D	"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because	107: 30,31D  !
3D	it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."	107: 30,32D  !
3A	"That would be a good scheme,"	107: 30,33A  !
3A	"if you	107: 30,33A  !
3A	were sure that they would not offer to send her home."	107: 30,34A  !
3D	"Oh| but the gentlemen will have Mr% Bingley's chaise	107: 30,35D  !
3D	to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to	107: 30,36D  !
3D	theirs."	107: 30,37D  !
3E	"I had much rather go in the coach."	107: 30,38E  !
3D	"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses,	107: 30,39D  !
3D	I am sure.  They are wanted in the farm, Mr% Bennett,	107: 31, 1D  !
3D	are not they?"	107: 31, 2D  !
3C	"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can	107: 31, 3C  !
3C	get them."	107: 31, 4C  !
3A	"But if you have got them to day,"	107: 31, 5A  !
3A	"my mother's purpose will be answered."	107: 31, 6A  !
3D	"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed|"	107: 31,16D  !
3E	"My dearest Lizzy,	107: 31,22E  !
3E	"I find myself very unwell this morning, which,	107: 31,23E  !
3E	I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through	107: 31,24E  !
3E	yesterday.  My kind friends will not hear of my returning	107: 31,25E  !
3E	home till I am better.  They insist also on my seeing	107: 31,26E  !
3E	Mr% Jones ~ therefore do not be alarmed if you should	107: 31,27E  !
3E	hear of his having been to me ~ and excepting a sore-throat	107: 31,28E  !
3E	and head-ache there is not much the matter with	107: 31,29E  !
3E	me.	107: 31,30E  !
3E	"Yours, &c%"	107: 31,31E  !
3C	"Well, my dear,"	107: 31,32C  !
3C	"if your daughter should have a	107: 31,33C  !
3C	dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be	107: 31,34C  !
3C	a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr% Bingley,	107: 31,35C  !
3C	and under your orders."	107: 31,36C  !
3D	"Oh|  I am not at all afraid of her dying.  People	107: 31,37D  !
3D	do not die of little trifling colds.  She will be taken good	107: 31,38D  !
3D	care of.  As long as she stays there, it is all very well.	107: 32, 1D  !
3D	I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage."	107: 32, 2D  !
3D	"How can you be so silly,"	107: 32, 7D  !
3D	"as to	107: 32, 7D  !
3D	think of such a thing, in all this dirt|  You will not be	107: 32, 8D  !
3D	fit to be seen when you get there."	107: 32, 9D  !
3A	"I shall be very fit to see Jane ~ which is all I want."	107: 32,10A  !
3C	"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,"	107: 32,11C  !
3C	"to send	107: 32,11C  !
3C	for the horses?"	107: 32,12C  !
3A	"No, indeed.  I do not wish to avoid the walk.  The	107: 32,13A  !
3A	distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three	107: 32,14A  !
3A	miles.  I shall be back by dinner."	107: 32,15A  !
3H	"If we make haste,"	107: 32,23H  !
3H	"perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before	107: 32,24H  !
3H	he goes."	107: 32,25H  !
3J	"She did indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my	108: 36, 1J  !
3J	countenance.  Very nonsensical to come at all|  Why	108: 36, 2J  !
3J	must \she\ be scampering about the country, because her	108: 36, 3J  !
3J	sister had a cold?  Her hair so untidy, so blowsy|"	108: 36, 4J  !
3J	"\You\ observed it, Mr% Darcy, I am sure,"	108: 36,14J  !
3J	"and I am inclined to think that you would	108: 36,15J  !
3J	not wish to see \your\ \sister\ make such an exhibition."	108: 36,16J  !
3B	"Certainly not."	108: 36,17B  !
3J	"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or	108: 36,18J  !
3J	whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite	108: 36,19J  !
3J	alone| what could she mean by it?  It seems to me	108: 36,20J  !
3J	to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,	108: 36,21J  !
3J	a most country town indifference to decorum."	108: 36,22J  !
3J	"I am afraid, Mr% Darcy,"	108: 36,25J  !
3J	"that this adventure has rather affected	108: 36,26J  !
3J	your admiration of her fine eyes."	108: 36,27J  !
3B	"Not at all,"	108: 36,28B  !
3B	"they were brightened by	108: 36,28B  !
3B	the exercise." ~	108: 36,29B  !
3J	"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an	108: 36,35J  !
3J	attorney in Meryton."	108: 36,36J  !
3J	"That is capital,"	108: 37, 1J  !
3B	"But it must very materially lessen their chance of	108: 37, 5B  !
3B	marrying men of any consideration in the world,"	108: 37, 6B  !
3J	"Miss Eliza Bennet,"	108: 37,27J  !
3J	"despises cards.	108: 37,27J  !
3J	She is a great reader and has no pleasure in any thing else."	108: 37,28J  !
3A	"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,"	108: 37,29A  !
3A	"I am \not\ a great reader, and I have pleasure	108: 37,30A  !
3A	in many things."	108: 37,31A  !
3J	"I am astonished,"	108: 38, 6J  !
3J	"that my father	108: 38, 6J  !
3J	should have left so small a collection of books. ~ What	108: 38, 7J  !
3J	a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr% Darcy|"	108: 38, 8J  !
3B	"It ought to be good,"	108: 38, 9B  !
3B	"it has been the	108: 38, 9B  !
3B	work of many generations."	108: 38,10B  !
3J	"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you	108: 38,11J  !

3J	"Neglect|  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add	108: 38,15J  !

3J	build \your\ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as	108: 38,17J  !
3J	Pemberley."	108: 38,18J  !
3J	"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in	108: 38,20J  !
3J	that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	108: 38,21J  !
3J	There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."	108: 38,22J  !
3J	"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."	108: 38,25J  !
3J	"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"	108: 38,33J  !
3J	"will she be as tall as I am?"	108: 38,34J  !

3J	such manners| and so extremely accomplished for her	108: 39, 1J  !
3J	age|  Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite."	108: 39, 2J  !
3J	"All young ladies accomplished|  My dear Charles, what	108: 39, 6J  !
3J	do you mean?"	108: 39, 7J  !
3B	"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,"	108: 39,13B  !

3B	to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by	108: 39,15B  !
3B	netting a purse, or covering a skreen.  But I am very far	108: 39,16B  !
3B	from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in	108: 39,17B  !
3B	general.  I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen,	108: 39,18B  !

3J	"no one	108: 39,25J  !
3J	can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly	108: 39,26J  !

3J	a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing,	108: 39,28J  !
3J	and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides	108: 39,29J  !
3J	all this, she must possess a certain something in her	108: 39,30J  !
3J	air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address	108: 39,31J  !
3J	and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved."	108: 39,32J  !
3B	"All this she must possess,"	108: 39,33B  !

3J	their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.	108: 40,16J  !
3J	But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	108: 40,17J  !
3B	"Undoubtedly,"	108: 40,18B  !
3B	"there is meanness in \all\ the arts	108: 40,19B  !
3B	which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.	108: 40,20B  !
3B	Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."	108: 40,21B  !
3D	"Indeed I have, Sir,"	109: 41,26D  !
3D	"She is a great	109: 41,26D  !
3D	deal too ill to be moved.  Mr% Jones says we must not	109: 41,27D  !
3D	think of moving her.  We must trespass a little longer	109: 41,28D  !
3D	on your kindness."	109: 41,29D  !
3J	"You may depend upon it, Madam,"	109: 41,33J  !
3J	"that Miss Bennet shall receive every	109: 42, 1J  !
3J	possible attention while she remains with us."	109: 42, 2J  !
3D	"I am sure,"	109: 42, 4D  !
3D	"if it was not for such good	109: 42, 4D  !
3D	friends I do not know what would become of her, for she	109: 42, 5D  !
3D	is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the	109: 42, 6D  !
3D	greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with	109: 42, 7D  !
3D	her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I	109: 42, 8D  !
3D	ever met with.  I often tell my other girls they are nothing	109: 42, 9D  !
3D	to \her\.  You have a sweet room here, Mr% Bingley, and a	109: 42,10D  !
3D	charming prospect over that gravel walk.  I do not know	109: 42,11D  !
3D	a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.  You	109: 42,12D  !
3D	will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though	109: 42,13D  !
3D	you have but a short lease."	109: 42,14D  !
3A	"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,"	109: 42,19A  !
3A	"Oh| yes ~ I understand you perfectly."	109: 42,23A  !
3A	"That is as it happens.  It does not necessarily follow	109: 42,26A  !
3A	that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable	109: 42,27A  !
3A	than such a one as yours."	109: 42,28A  !
3D	"Lizzy,"	109: 42,29D  !
3D	"remember where you are,	109: 42,29D  !
3D	and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered	109: 42,30D  !
3D	to do at home."	109: 42,31D  !
3A	"Yes; but intricate characters are the \most\ amusing.	109: 42,35A  !
3A	They have at least that advantage."	109: 42,36A  !
3B	"The country,"	109: 42,37B  !
3B	"can in general supply but	109: 42,37B  !
3B	few subjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood	109: 42,38B  !
3B	you move in a very confined and unvarying	109: 43, 1B  !
3B	society."	109: 43, 2B  !
3A	"But people themselves alter so much, that there is	109: 43, 3A  !
3A	something new to be observed in them for ever."	109: 43, 4A  !
3D	"Yes, indeed,"	109: 43, 5D  !
3D	"I	109: 43, 6D  !
3D	assure you there is quite as much of \that\ going on in the	109: 43, 7D  !
3D	country as in town."	109: 43, 8D  !
3D	"I cannot see that London has any great advantage	109: 43,13D  !
3D	over the country for my part, except the shops and public	109: 43,14D  !
3D	places.  The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it,	109: 43,15D  !
3D	Mr% Bingley?"	109: 43,16D  !
3D	"Aye ~ that is because you have the right disposition.	109: 43,21D  !
3D	But that gentleman,"	109: 43,22D  !
3D	"seemed to think	109: 43,22D  !
3D	the country was nothing at all."	109: 43,23D  !
3A	"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,"	109: 43,24A  !
3A	"You quite mistook Mr% Darcy.	109: 43,25A  !
3A	He only meant that there were not such a variety of people	109: 43,26A  !
3A	to be met with in the country as in town, which you must	109: 43,27A  !
3A	acknowledge to be true."	109: 43,28A  !
3D	"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as	109: 43,29D  !
3D	to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood,	109: 43,30D  !
3D	I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.  I know	109: 43,31D  !
3D	we dine with four and twenty families."	109: 43,32D  !
3D	"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an	109: 44, 1D  !
3D	agreeable man Sir William is, Mr% Bingley ~ is not he?	109: 44, 2D  !
3D	so much the man of fashion| so genteel and so easy| ~	109: 44, 3D  !
3D	He has always something to say to every body. ~ \That\ is	109: 44, 4D  !
3D	my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy	109: 44, 5D  !
3D	themselves very important and never open their mouths,	109: 44, 6D  !
3D	quite mistake the matter."	109: 44, 7D  !
3A	"Did Charlotte dine with you?"	109: 44, 8A  !
3D	"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted	109: 44, 9D  !
3D	about the mince pies.  For my part, Mr% Bingley, \I\ always	109: 44,10D  !
3D	keep servants that can do their own work; \my\ daughters	109: 44,11D  !
3D	are brought up differently.  But every body is to judge	109: 44,12D  !
3D	for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of	109: 44,13D  !
3D	girls, I assure you.  It is a pity they are not handsome|	109: 44,14D  !
3D	Not that \I\ think Charlotte so \very\ plain ~ but then she is	109: 44,15D  !
3D	our particular friend."	109: 44,16D  !
3D	"Oh| dear, yes; ~ but you must own she is very plain.	109: 44,19D  !
3D	Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me	109: 44,20D  !
3D	Jane's beauty.  I do not like to boast of my own child,	109: 44,21D  !
3D	but to be sure, Jane ~ one does not often see any body	109: 44,22D  !
3D	better looking.  It is what every body says.  I do not	109: 44,23D  !
3D	trust my own partiality.  When she was only fifteen,	109: 44,24D  !
3D	there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town,	109: 44,25D  !
3D	so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure	109: 44,26D  !
3D	he would make her an offer before we came away.  But	109: 44,27D  !
3D	however he did not.  Perhaps he thought her too young.	109: 44,28D  !
3D	However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty	109: 44,29D  !
3D	they were."	109: 44,30D  !
3A	"And so ended his affection,"	109: 44,31A  !
3A	"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome	109: 44,32A  !
3A	in the same way.  I wonder who first discovered	109: 44,33A  !
3A	the efficacy of poetry in driving away love|"	109: 44,34A  !
3B	"I have been used to consider poetry as the \food\ of	109: 44,35B  !
3B	love,"	109: 44,36B  !
3A	"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Every thing	109: 44,37A  !
3A	nourishes what is strong already.  But if it be only a	109: 44,38A  !
3A	slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one	109: 45, 1A  !
3A	good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	109: 45, 2A  !
3H	"Oh| yes ~ it would	109: 45,36H  !
3H	be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time	109: 45,37H  !
3H	most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.	109: 46, 1H  !
3H	And when you have given \your\ ball,"	109: 46, 2H  !
3H	"I shall	109: 46, 2H  !
3H	insist on their giving one also.  I shall tell Colonel Forster	109: 46, 3H  !
3H	it will be quite a shame if he does not."	109: 46, 4H  !
3J	"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such	110: 47,19J  !
3J	a letter|"	110: 47,20J  !
3J	"You write uncommonly fast."	110: 47,22J  !
3B	"You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly."	110: 47,23B  !
3J	"How many letters you must have occasion to write	110: 47,24J  !
3J	in the course of the year|  Letters of business too|  How	110: 47,25J  !
3J	odious I should think them|"	110: 47,26J  !
3B	"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead	110: 47,27B  !
3B	of to yours."	110: 47,28B  !
3J	"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."	110: 47,29J  !
3B	"I have already told her so once, by your desire."	110: 47,30B  !
3J	"I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend	110: 47,31J  !
3J	it for you.  I mend pens remarkably well."	110: 47,32J  !
3B	"Thank you ~ but I always mend my own."	110: 47,33B  !
3J	"How can you contrive to write so even?"	110: 48, 1J  !
3J	"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement	110: 48, 3J  !
3J	on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite	110: 48, 4J  !
3J	in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table,	110: 48, 5J  !
3J	and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."	110: 48, 6J  !
3B	"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till	110: 48, 7B  !
3B	I write again? ~ At present I have not room to do them	110: 48, 8B  !
3B	justice."	110: 48, 9B  !
3J	"Oh| it is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.	110: 48,10J  !
3J	But do you always write such charming long letters to	110: 48,11J  !
3J	her, Mr% Darcy?"	110: 48,12J  !
3B	"They are generally long; but whether always charming,	110: 48,13B  !
3B	it is not for me to determine."	110: 48,14B  !
3J	"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write	110: 48,15J  !
3J	a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill."	110: 48,16J  !
3B	"My stile of writing is very different from yours."	110: 48,21B  !
3J	"Oh|"	110: 48,22J  !
3J	"Charles writes in the most	110: 48,22J  !
3J	careless way imaginable.  He leaves out half his words,	110: 48,23J  !
3J	and blots the rest."	110: 48,24J  !
3A	"Your humility, Mr% Bingley,"	110: 48,28A  !
3A	"must	110: 48,28A  !
3A	disarm reproof."	110: 48,29A  !
3B	"Nothing is more deceitful,"	110: 48,30B  !
3B	"than the	110: 48,30B  !
3B	appearance of humility.  It is often only carelessness of	110: 48,31B  !
3B	opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."	110: 48,32B  !
3B	"The indirect boast; ~ for you are really proud of your	110: 48,35B  !
3B	defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding	110: 48,36B  !
3B	from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of	110: 48,37B  !
3B	execution, which if not estimable, you think at least	110: 48,38B  !
3B	highly interesting.  The power of doing any thing with	110: 49, 1B  !
3B	quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and	110: 49, 2B  !
3B	often without any attention to the imperfection of the	110: 49, 3B  !
3B	performance.  When you told Mrs% Bennet this morning	110: 49, 4B  !
3B	that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you	110: 49, 5B  !
3B	should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort	110: 49, 6B  !
3B	of panegyric, of compliment to yourself ~ and yet what	110: 49, 7B  !
3B	is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must	110: 49, 8B  !
3B	leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real	110: 49, 9B  !
3B	advantage to yourself or any one else?"	110: 49,10B  !
3B	"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means	110: 49,17B  !
3B	convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.	110: 49,18B  !
3B	Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as	110: 49,19B  !
3B	that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting	110: 49,20B  !
3B	your horse, a friend were to say, ""Bingley, you had better	110: 49,21B  !
3B	stay till next week,"" you would probably do it, you would	110: 49,22B  !
3B	probably not go ~ and, at another word, might stay a	110: 49,23B  !
3B	month."	110: 49,24B  !
3A	"You have only proved by this,"	110: 49,25A  !
3A	"that Mr% Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.	110: 49,26A  !
3A	You have shewn him off now much more than	110: 49,27A  !
3A	he did himself."	110: 49,28A  !
3A	"Would Mr% Darcy then consider the rashness of your	110: 49,36A  !
3A	original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in	110: 49,37A  !
3A	adhering to it?"	110: 49,38A  !
3B	"You expect me to account for opinions which you	110: 50, 3B  !
3B	chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.	110: 50, 4B  !
3B	Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your	110: 50, 5B  !
3B	representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the	110: 50, 6B  !
3B	friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house,	110: 50, 7B  !
3B	and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it	110: 50, 8B  !
3B	without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."	110: 50, 9B  !
3A	"To yield readily ~ easily ~ to the \persuasion\ of a friend	110: 50,10A  !
3A	is no merit with you."	110: 50,11A  !
3B	"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the	110: 50,12B  !
3B	understanding of either."	110: 50,13B  !
3A	"You appear to me, Mr% Darcy, to allow nothing for	110: 50,14A  !
3A	the influence of friendship and affection.  A regard for	110: 50,15A  !
3A	the requester would often make one readily yield to a	110: 50,16A  !
3A	request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into	110: 50,17A  !
3A	it.  I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you	110: 50,18A  !
3A	have supposed about Mr% Bingley.  We may as well wait,	110: 50,19A  !
3A	perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss	110: 50,20A  !
3A	the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.  But in general	110: 50,21A  !
3A	and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one	110: 50,22A  !
3A	of them is desired by the other to change a resolution	110: 50,23A  !
3A	of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person	110: 50,24A  !
3A	for complying with the desire, without waiting to be	110: 50,25A  !
3A	argued into it?"	110: 50,26A  !
3B	"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this	110: 50,27B  !
3B	subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree	110: 50,28B  !
3B	of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well	110: 50,29B  !
3B	as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"	110: 50,30B  !
3B	"I see your design, Bingley,"	110: 51, 8B  !
3B	"You	110: 51, 8B  !
3B	dislike an argument, and want to silence this."	110: 51, 9B  !
3A	"What you ask,"	110: 51,14A  !
3A	"is no sacrifice on	110: 51,14A  !
3A	my side; and Mr% Darcy had much better finish his letter."	110: 51,15A  !
3B	"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to	110: 52, 1B  !
3B	seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"	110: 52, 2B  !
3A	"Oh|"	110: 52, 5A  !
3A	"I heard you before; but I could not	110: 52, 5A  !
3A	immediately determine what to say in reply.  You wanted	110: 52, 6A  !
3A	me, I know, to say ""Yes,"" that you might have the pleasure	110: 52, 7A  !
3A	of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing	110: 52, 8A  !
3A	those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their	110: 52, 9A  !
3A	premeditated contempt.  I have therefore made up my	110: 52,10A  !
3A	mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all ~	110: 52,11A  !
3A	and now despise me if you dare."	110: 52,12A  !
3B	"Indeed I do not dare."	110: 52,13B  !
3J	"I hope,"	110: 52,28J  !
3J	"you will give your mother-in-law	110: 52,29J  !
3J	a few hints, when this desirable event takes place,	110: 52,30J  !
3J	as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you	110: 52,31J  !
3J	can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after	110: 52,32J  !
3J	the officers. ~ And, if I may mention so delicate a subject,	110: 52,33J  !
3J	endeavour to check that little something, bordering on	110: 52,34J  !
3J	conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."	110: 52,35J  !
3B	"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic	110: 52,36B  !
3B	felicity?"	110: 52,37B  !
3J	"Oh| yes. ~ Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt	110: 52,38J  !
3J	Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them	110: 53, 1J  !
3J	next to your great uncle the judge.  They are in the	110: 53, 2J  !
3J	same profession, you know; only in different lines.  As for	110: 53, 3J  !
3J	your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it	110: 53, 4J  !
3J	taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful	110: 53, 5J  !
3J	eyes?"	110: 53, 6J  !
3B	"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression,	110: 53, 7B  !
3B	but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably	110: 53, 8B  !
3B	fine, might be copied."	110: 53, 9B  !
3J	"I did not know that you intended to walk,"	110: 53,12J  !
3B	"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had	110: 53,22B  !
3B	better go into the avenue."	110: 53,23B  !
3A	"No, no; stay where you are. ~ You are charmingly	110: 53,26A  !
3A	group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.  The	110: 53,27A  !
3A	picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	110: 53,28A  !
3A	Good bye."	110: 53,29A  !
3J	"How pleasant	111: 55,12J  !
3J	it is to spend an evening in this way|  I declare after all	111: 55,13J  !
3J	there is no enjoyment like reading|  How much sooner	111: 55,14J  !

3J	such a meeting.  It would surely be much more rational	111: 55,36J  !
3J	if conversation instead of dancing made the order of	111: 55,37J  !
3J	the day."	111: 55,38J  !
3J	"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my	111: 56, 9J  !
3J	example, and take a turn about the room. ~ I assure you	111: 56,10J  !
3J	it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."	111: 56,11J  !

3A	he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing	111: 56,25A  !

3B	you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs	111: 56,33B  !
3B	to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures	111: 56,34B  !
3B	appear to the greatest advantage in walking; ~ if the first,	111: 56,35B  !
3B	I should be completely in your way; ~ and if the second,	111: 56,36B  !
3B	I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."	111: 56,37B  !
3J	"Oh| shocking?"	111: 56,38J  !

3J	us there.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves,	111: 57,10J  !

3A	"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope	111: 57,14A  !
3A	it will continue, for it would be a great loss to \me\ to have	111: 57,15A  !

3B	"Miss Bingley,"	111: 57,17B  !

3B	"Perhaps that is not possible for any one.  But it has	111: 57,27B  !
3B	been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which	111: 57,28B  !
3B	often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."	111: 57,29B  !

3A	"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr% Darcy has	111: 57,37A  !

3B	My temper I dare not vouch for. ~ It is I believe	111: 58, 3B  !
3B	too little yielding ~ certainly too little for the convenience	111: 58, 4B  !
3B	of the world.  I cannot forget the follies and vices of others	111: 58, 5B  !
3B	so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.	111: 58, 6B  !
3B	My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to	111: 58, 7B  !

3K	\15th\ \October\.	113: 62,24K  !
3K	DEAR SIR,	113: 62,25K  !
3K	The disagreement subsisting between yourself and	113: 62,26K  !
3K	my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness,	113: 62,27K  !
3K	and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have	113: 62,28K  !
3K	frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time	113: 62,29K  !
3K	I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might	113: 62,30K  !
3K	seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good	113: 62,31K  !
3K	terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased	113: 62,32K  !
3K	him to be at variance.	113: 62,33K  !
3C	"There, Mrs% Bennet." ~	113: 62,33C  !
3K	My mind	113: 62,33K  !
3K	however is now made up on the subject, for having received	113: 62,34K  !
3K	ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be	113: 62,35K  !
3K	distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh,	113: 62,36K  !
3K	widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,	113: 62,37K  !
3K	whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the	113: 62,38K  !
3K	valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my	113: 63, 1K  !
3K	earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect	113: 63, 2K  !
3K	towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those	113: 63, 3K  !
3K	rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church	113: 63, 4K  !
3K	of England.  As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty	113: 63, 5K  !
3K	to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families	113: 63, 6K  !
3K	within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds	113: 63, 7K  !
3K	I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will	113: 63, 8K  !
3K	are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of	113: 63, 9K  !
3K	my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be	113: 63,10K  !
3K	kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject	113: 63,11K  !
3K	the offered olive branch.  I cannot be otherwise than	113: 63,12K  !
3K	concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable	113: 63,13K  !
3K	daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to	113: 63,14K  !
3K	assure you of my readiness to make them every possible	113: 63,15K  !
3K	amends, ~ but of this hereafter.  If you should have no	113: 63,16K  !
3K	objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself	113: 63,17K  !
3K	the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family,	113: 63,18K  !
3K	Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall	113: 63,19K  !
3K	probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday	113: 63,20K  !
3K	se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience,	113: 63,21K  !
3K	as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to	113: 63,22K  !
3K	my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some	113: 63,23K  !
3K	other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.	113: 63,24K  !
3K	I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your	113: 63,25K  !
3K	lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,	113: 63,26K  !
3K	WILLIAM COLLINS."	113: 63,27K  !
3C	"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making	113: 63,29C  !
3C	gentleman,"	113: 63,30C  !
3C	"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite	113: 63,31C  !
3C	young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove	113: 63,32C  !
3C	a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine	113: 63,33C  !
3C	should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."	113: 63,34C  !
3D	"There is some sense in what he says about the girls	113: 63,35D  !
3D	however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends,	113: 63,36D  !
3D	I shall not be the person to discourage him."	113: 63,37D  !
3E	"Though it is difficult,"	113: 63,38E  !
3E	"to guess in what	113: 63,38E  !
3E	way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks	113: 64, 1E  !
3E	our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."	113: 64, 2E  !
3A	"He must be an oddity, I think,"	113: 64, 7A  !
3A	"I cannot	113: 64, 7A  !
3A	make him out. ~ There is something very pompous in his	113: 64, 8A  !
3A	stile. ~ And what can he mean by apologizing for being	113: 64, 9A  !
3A	next in the entail? ~ We cannot suppose he would help	113: 64,10A  !
3A	it, if he could. ~ Can he be a sensible man, sir?"	113: 64,11A  !
3C	"No, my dear; I think not.  I have great hopes of	113: 64,12C  !
3C	finding him quite the reverse.  There is a mixture of	113: 64,13C  !
3C	servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises	113: 64,14C  !
3C	well.  I am impatient to see him."	113: 64,15C  !
3D	"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all	113: 65, 5D  !
3D	my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute	113: 65, 6D  !
3D	enough.  Things are settled so oddly."	113: 65, 7D  !
3K	"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	113: 65, 8K  !
3D	"Ah| sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my	113: 65, 9D  !
3D	poor girls, you must confess.  Not that I mean to find	113: 65,10D  !
3D	fault with \you\, for such things I know are all chance in	113: 65,11D  !
3D	this world.  There is no knowing how estates will go when	113: 65,12D  !
3D	once they come to be entailed."	113: 65,13D  !
3K	"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my	113: 65,14K  !
3K	fair cousins, ~ and could say much on the subject, but that	113: 65,15K  !
3K	I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.	113: 65,16K  !
3K	But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared	113: 65,17K  !
3K	to admire them.  At present I will not say more, but	113: 65,18K  !
3K	perhaps when we are better acquainted ~"	113: 65,19K  !
3D	"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,"	114: 66,32D  !
3D	"and I dare say she is a very agreeable	114: 66,33D  !
3D	woman.  It is a pity that great ladies in general are not	114: 67, 1D  !
3D	more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"	114: 67, 2D  !
3K	"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is	114: 67, 3K  !
3K	separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's	114: 67, 4K  !
3K	residence."	114: 67, 5K  !
3D	"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any	114: 67, 6D  !
3D	family?"	114: 67, 7D  !
3K	"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings,	114: 67, 8K  !
3K	and of very extensive property."	114: 67, 9K  !
3D	"Ah|"	114: 67,10D  !
3D	"then	114: 67,10D  !
3D	she is better off than many girls.  And what sort of young	114: 67,11D  !
3D	lady is she?  is she handsome?"	114: 67,12D  !
3K	"She is a most charming young lady indeed.  Lady Catherine	114: 67,13K  !
3K	herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh	114: 67,14K  !
3K	is far superior to the handsomest of her sex;	114: 67,15K  !
3K	because there is that in her features which marks the	114: 67,16K  !
3K	young woman of distinguished birth.  She is unfortunately	114: 67,17K  !
3K	of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her	114: 67,18K  !
3K	making that progress in many accomplishments, which	114: 67,19K  !
3K	she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed	114: 67,20K  !
3K	by the lady who superintended her education, and who	114: 67,21K  !
3K	still resides with them.  But she is perfectly amiable,	114: 67,22K  !
3K	and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in	114: 67,23K  !
3K	her little phaeton and ponies."	114: 67,24K  !
3D	"Has she been presented?  I do not remember her	114: 67,25D  !
3D	name among the ladies at court."	114: 67,26D  !
3K	"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents	114: 67,27K  !
3K	her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine	114: 67,28K  !
3K	myself one day, has deprived the British court	114: 67,29K  !
3K	of its brightest ornament.  Her ladyship seemed pleased	114: 67,30K  !
3K	with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy	114: 67,31K  !
3K	on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments	114: 67,32K  !
3K	which are always acceptable to ladies.  I have	114: 67,33K  !
3K	more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her	114: 67,34K  !
3K	charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that	114: 67,35K  !
3K	the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence,	114: 67,36K  !
3K	would be adorned by her. ~ These are the kind of little	114: 67,37K  !
3K	things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of	114: 67,38K  !
3K	attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to	114: 68, 1K  !
3K	pay."	114: 68, 2K  !
3C	"You judge very properly,"	114: 68, 3C  !
3C	"and it	114: 68, 3C  !
3C	is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering	114: 68, 4C  !
3C	with delicacy.  May I ask whether these pleasing attentions	114: 68, 5C  !
3C	proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the	114: 68, 6C  !
3C	result of previous study?"	114: 68, 7C  !
3K	"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time,	114: 68, 8K  !

3V	cold manner of our meeting yesterday. ~ Are you much	116: 77,25V  !
3V	acquainted with Mr% Darcy?"	116: 77,26V  !

3V	"as to his being agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified	116: 77,31V  !
3V	to form one.  I have known him too long and too well to	116: 77,32V  !
3V	be a fair judge.  It is impossible for \me\ to be impartial.	116: 77,33V  !
3V	But I believe your opinion of him would in general	116: 77,34V  !

3A	"Upon my word I say no more \here\ than I might say	116: 77,37A  !
3A	in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	116: 77,38A  !
3A	He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.  Every body is	116: 78, 1A  !
3A	disgusted with his pride.  You will not find him more	116: 78, 2A  !

3V	not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with \him\	116: 78, 6V  !
3V	I believe it does not often happen.  The world is blinded	116: 78, 7V  !
3V	by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high	116: 78, 8V  !
3V	and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to	116: 78, 9V  !

3V	"Oh| no ~ it is not for \me\ to be driven away by	116: 78,21V  !
3V	Mr% Darcy.  If \he\ wishes to avoid seeing \me\, he must go.	116: 78,22V  !
3V	We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain	116: 78,23V  !

3V	but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of	116: 78,25V  !
3V	very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being	116: 78,26V  !
3V	what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr% Darcy,	116: 78,27V  !
3V	was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest	116: 78,28V  !
3V	friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with	116: 78,29V  !
3V	this Mr% Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a	116: 78,30V  !
3V	thousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself	116: 78,31V  !
3V	has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive	116: 78,32V  !
3V	him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing	116: 78,33V  !
3V	the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."	116: 78,34V  !
3V	"It was the prospect of constant society, and good	116: 79, 4V  !
3V	society,"	116: 79, 5V  !
3V	"which was my chief inducement to	116: 79, 5V  !
3V	enter the @@@@ shire.  I knew it to be a most respectable,	116: 79, 6V  !
3V	agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther	116: 79, 7V  !
3V	by his account of their present quarters, and the very great	116: 79, 8V  !
3V	attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured	116: 79, 9V  !
3V	them.  Society, I own, is necessary to me.  I have	116: 79,10V  !
3V	been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear	116: 79,11V  !
3V	solitude.  I \must\ have employment and society.  A	116: 79,12V  !
3V	military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances	116: 79,13V  !
3V	have now made it eligible.  The church \ought\ to	116: 79,14V  !
3V	have been my profession ~ I was brought up for the church,	116: 79,15V  !
3V	and I should at this time have been in possession of a most	116: 79,16V  !
3V	valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were	116: 79,17V  !
3V	speaking of just now."	116: 79,18V  !
3A	"Indeed|"	116: 79,19A  !
3V	"Yes ~ the late Mr% Darcy bequeathed me the next	116: 79,20V  !
3V	presentation of the best living in his gift.  He was my	116: 79,21V  !
3V	godfather, and excessively attached to me.  I cannot do	116: 79,22V  !
3V	justice to his kindness.  He meant to provide for me	116: 79,23V  !
3V	amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living	116: 79,24V  !
3V	fell, it was given elsewhere."	116: 79,25V  !
3A	"Good heavens|"	116: 79,26A  !
3A	"but how could	116: 79,26A  !
3A	\that\ be? ~ How could his will be disregarded? ~ Why did	116: 79,27A  !
3A	not you seek legal redress?"	116: 79,28A  !
3V	"There was just such an informality in the terms of	116: 79,29V  !
3V	the bequest as to give me no hope from law.  A man of	116: 79,30V  !
3V	honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr% Darcy	116: 79,31V  !
3V	chose to doubt it ~ or to treat it as a merely conditional	116: 79,32V  !
3V	recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited	116: 79,33V  !
3V	all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short	116: 79,34V  !
3V	any thing or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became	116: 79,35V  !
3V	vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold	116: 79,36V  !
3V	it, and that it was given to another man; and no less	116: 79,37V  !
3V	certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really	116: 79,38V  !
3V	done any thing to deserve to lose it.  I have a warm,	116: 80, 1V  !
3V	unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes	116: 80, 2V  !
3V	spoken my opinion \of\ him, and \to\ him, too freely.  I can	116: 80, 3V  !
3V	recal nothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very	116: 80, 4V  !
3V	different sort of men, and that he hates me."	116: 80, 5V  !
3A	"This is quite shocking| ~ He deserves to be publicly	116: 80, 6A  !
3A	disgraced."	116: 80, 7A  !
3V	"Some time or other he \will\ be ~ but it shall not be	116: 80, 8V  !
3V	by \me\.  Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or	116: 80, 9V  !
3V	expose \him\."	116: 80,10V  !
3A	"But what,"	116: 80,13A  !
3A	"can have been	116: 80,13A  !
3A	his motive? ~ what can have induced him to behave so	116: 80,14A  !
3A	cruelly?"	116: 80,15A  !
3V	"A thorough, determined dislike of me ~ a dislike which	116: 80,16V  !
3V	I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had	116: 80,17V  !
3V	the late Mr% Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne	116: 80,18V  !
3V	with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment	116: 80,19V  !
3V	to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.  He had	116: 80,20V  !
3V	not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we	116: 80,21V  !
3V	stood ~ the sort of preference which was often given me."	116: 80,22V  !
3A	"I had not thought Mr% Darcy so bad as this ~ though	116: 80,23A  !
3A	I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of	116: 80,24A  !
3A	him ~ I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures	116: 80,25A  !
3A	in general, but did not suspect him of descending	116: 80,26A  !
3A	to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity	116: 80,27A  !
3A	as this|"	116: 80,28A  !
3A	"I \do\ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of	116: 80,30A  !
3A	the implacability of his resentments, of his having an	116: 80,31A  !
3A	unforgiving temper.  His disposition must be dreadful."	116: 80,32A  !
3V	"I will not trust myself on the subject,"	116: 80,33V  !
3V	"\I\ can hardly be just to him."	116: 80,34V  !
3A	"To treat in such a manner, the godson, the	116: 80,36A  !
3A	friend, the favourite of his father|" ~	116: 80,37A  !
3A	"And one, too, who had probably	116: 81, 2A  !
3A	been his own companion from childhood, connected	116: 81, 3A  !
3A	together, as I think you said, in the closest manner|"	116: 81, 4A  !
3V	"We were born in the same parish, within the same	116: 81, 5V  !
3V	park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together;	116: 81, 6V  !
3V	inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements,	116: 81, 7V  !
3V	objects of the same parental care.  \My\ father began life	116: 81, 8V  !
3V	in the profession which your uncle, Mr% Philips, appears	116: 81, 9V  !
3V	to do so much credit to ~ but he gave up every thing to	116: 81,10V  !
3V	be of use to the late Mr% Darcy, and devoted all his time	116: 81,11V  !
3V	to the care of the Pemberley property.  He was most	116: 81,12V  !
3V	highly esteemed by Mr% Darcy, a most intimate, confidential	116: 81,13V  !
3V	friend.  Mr% Darcy often acknowledged himself to	116: 81,14V  !
3V	be under the greatest obligations to my father's active	116: 81,15V  !
3V	superintendance, and when immediately before my father's	116: 81,16V  !
3V	death, Mr% Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing	116: 81,17V  !
3V	for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much	116: 81,18V  !
3V	a debt of gratitude to \him\, as of affection to myself."	116: 81,19V  !
3A	"How strange|"	116: 81,20A  !
3A	"How abominable| ~	116: 81,20A  !
3A	I wonder that the very pride of this Mr% Darcy	116: 81,21A  !
3A	has not made him just to you| ~ If from no better motive,	116: 81,22A  !
3A	that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, ~	116: 81,23A  !
3A	for dishonesty I must call it."	116: 81,24A  !
3V	"It \is\ wonderful," ~	116: 81,25V  !
3V	"for almost	116: 81,25V  !
3V	all his actions may be traced to pride; ~ and pride has	116: 81,26V  !
3V	often been his best friend.  It has connected him nearer	116: 81,27V  !
3V	with virtue than any other feeling.  But we are none of	116: 81,28V  !
3V	us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were	116: 81,29V  !
3V	stronger impulses even than pride."	116: 81,30V  !
3A	"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done	116: 81,31A  !
3A	him good?"	116: 81,32A  !
3V	"Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, ~	116: 81,33V  !
3V	to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist	116: 81,34V  !
3V	his tenants, and relieve the poor.  Family pride, and \filial\	116: 81,35V  !
3V	pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have	116: 81,36V  !
3V	done this.  Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate	116: 81,37V  !
3V	from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the	116: 81,38V  !
3V	Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.  He has also	116: 82, 1V  !
3V	\brotherly\ pride, which with \some\ brotherly affection, makes	116: 82, 2V  !
3V	him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you	116: 82, 3V  !
3V	will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and	116: 82, 4V  !
3V	best of brothers."	116: 82, 5V  !
3A	"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"	116: 82, 6A  !
3V	"I wish I could call her amiable.	116: 82, 7V  !
3V	It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too	116: 82, 8V  !
3V	much like her brother, ~ very, very proud. ~ As a child,	116: 82, 9V  !
3V	she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of	116: 82,10V  !
3V	me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.	116: 82,11V  !
3V	But she is nothing to me now.  She is a handsome	116: 82,12V  !
3V	girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly	116: 82,13V  !
3V	accomplished.  Since her father's death, her home has	116: 82,14V  !
3V	been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends	116: 82,15V  !
3V	her education."	116: 82,16V  !
3A	"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr% Bingley|	116: 82,20A  !
3A	How can Mr% Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and	116: 82,21A  !
3A	is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with	116: 82,22A  !
3A	such a man?  How can they suit each other? ~ Do you	116: 82,23A  !
3A	know Mr% Bingley?"	116: 82,24A  !
3V	"Not at all."	116: 82,25V  !

3V	"Probably not; ~ but Mr% Darcy can please where he	116: 82,28V  !
3V	chuses.  He does not want abilities.  He can be a conversible	116: 82,29V  !
3V	companion if he thinks it worth his while.  Among	116: 82,30V  !
3V	those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very	116: 82,31V  !
3V	different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	116: 82,32V  !
3V	His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is	116: 82,33V  !
3V	liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and	116: 82,34V  !
3V	perhaps agreeable, ~ allowing something for fortune and	116: 82,35V  !

3K	"I know very well, madam,"	116: 83, 9K  !
3K	"that when	116: 83, 9K  !
3K	persons sit down to a card table, they must take their	116: 83,10K  !
3K	chance of these things, ~ and happily I am not in such	116: 83,11K  !
3K	circumstances as to make five shillings any object.  There	116: 83,12K  !

3V	unite the two estates."	116: 83,32V  !
3A	"Mr% Collins,"	116: 83,38A  !

3E	Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to	117: 85,15E  !

3E	me out of my opinion.  My dearest Lizzy, do but consider	117: 85,25E  !
3E	in what a disgraceful light it places Mr% Darcy, to be	117: 85,26E  !
3E	treating his father's favourite in such a manner, ~ one,	117: 85,27E  !
3E	whom his father had promised to provide for. ~ It is impossible.	117: 85,28E  !
3E	No man of common humanity, no man who had	117: 85,29E  !
3E	any value for his character, could be capable of it.  Can	117: 85,30E  !
3E	his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in	117: 85,31E  !
3E	him? oh| no."	117: 85,32E  !
3A	"I can much more easily believe Mr% Bingley's being	117: 85,33A  !

3A	a history of himself as he gave me last night; names,	117: 86, 2A  !
3A	facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony. ~ If it be	117: 86, 3A  !
3A	not so, let Mr% Darcy contradict it.  Besides, there was	117: 86, 4A  !
3A	truth in his looks."	117: 86, 5A  !

3K	to respectable people, can have any evil tendency;	117: 87,23K  !
3K	and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that	117: 87,24K  !
3K	I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair	117: 87,25K  !
3K	cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity	117: 87,26K  !
3K	of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first	117: 87,27K  !
3K	dances especially, ~ a preference which I trust my cousin	117: 87,28K  !

3A	Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are	118: 91,16A  !
3A	much pleasanter than public ones. ~ But \now\ we may be	118: 91,17A  !
3A	silent."	118: 91,18A  !
3B	"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	118: 91,19B  !
3A	"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It	118: 91,20A  !
3A	would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour	118: 91,21A  !
3A	together, and yet for the advantage of \some\, conversation	118: 91,22A  !
3A	ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble	118: 91,23A  !
3A	of saying as little as possible."	118: 91,24A  !

3A	speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze	118: 91,30A  !
3A	the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with	118: 91,31A  !

3A	hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created	118: 93,24A  !
3A	was unappeasable.  You are very cautious, I suppose,	118: 93,25A  !

3A	make it out."	118: 93,35A  !
3B	"And what is your success?"	118: 93,36B  !

3J	George Wickham| ~ Your sister has been talking to me	118: 94,20J  !
3J	about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and	118: 94,21J  !
3J	I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his	118: 94,22J  !
3J	other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham,	118: 94,23J  !
3J	the late Mr% Darcy's steward.  Let me recommend you,	118: 94,24J  !
3J	however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all	118: 94,25J  !
3J	his assertions; for as to Mr% Darcy's using him ill, it is	118: 94,26J  !
3J	perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always	118: 94,27J  !
3J	remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has	118: 94,28J  !
3J	treated Mr% Darcy in a most infamous manner.  I do not	118: 94,29J  !
3J	know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr% Darcy	118: 94,30J  !
3J	is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear	118: 94,31J  !
3J	George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother	118: 94,32J  !
3J	thought he could not well avoid including him in his	118: 94,33J  !
3J	invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find	118: 94,34J  !
3J	that he had taken himself out of the way.  His coming	118: 94,35J  !
3J	into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed,	118: 94,36J  !
3J	and I wonder how he could presume to do it.  I pity you,	118: 94,37J  !
3J	Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;	118: 94,38J  !
3J	but really considering his descent, one could not expect	118: 95, 1J  !
3J	much better."	118: 95, 2J  !
3A	"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to	118: 95, 3A  !
3A	be the same,"	118: 95, 4A  !
3A	"for I have heard	118: 95, 4A  !
3A	you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son	118: 95, 5A  !
3A	of Mr% Darcy's steward, and of \that\, I can assure you, he	118: 95, 6A  !
3A	informed me himself."	118: 95, 7A  !

3A	case you may be sure of my pardon."	118: 95,28A  !
3E	"No,"	118: 95,29E  !

3E	Mr% Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the	118: 95,33E  !
3E	probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced	118: 95,34E  !
3E	that Mr% Wickham has deserved much less attention from	118: 95,35E  !
3E	Mr% Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say	118: 95,36E  !
3E	that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr% Wickham	118: 95,37E  !
3E	is by no means a respectable young man.  I am afraid	118: 95,38E  !
3E	he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose	118: 96, 1E  !
3E	Mr% Darcy's regard."	118: 96, 2E  !

3A	say of the living?"	118: 96, 8A  !

3E	only."	118: 96,12E  !

3A	"but you must excuse my not being	118: 96,14A  !
3A	convinced by assurances only.  Mr% Bingley's defence of	118: 96,15A  !
3A	his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he	118: 96,16A  !
3A	is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has	118: 96,17A  !
3A	learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture	118: 96,18A  !

3K	\nephew\.  It will be in my power to assure him that her	118: 97,10K  !
3K	ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."	118: 97,11K  !
3K	"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion	118: 97,22K  !
3K	in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters	118: 97,23K  !

3K	to say that there must be a wide difference between the	118: 97,25K  !
3K	established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those	118: 97,26K  !
3K	which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe	118: 97,27K  !

3K	dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads	118: 97,32K  !
3K	me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.  Pardon	118: 97,33K  !

3K	utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of	118: 98,20K  !
3K	saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's	118: 98,21K  !
3K	discernment as to be certain she could never bestow	118: 98,22K  !
3K	a favour unworthily.  It was really a very handsome	118: 98,23K  !
3K	thought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."	118: 98,24K  !

3K	time that remains will not be too much for his parish	118:101,19K  !
3K	duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling,	118:101,20K  !
3K	which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable	118:101,21K  !
3K	as possible.  And I do not think it of light importance that	118:101,22K  !
3K	he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards	118:101,23K  !
3K	every body, especially towards those to whom he owes	118:101,24K  !
3K	his preferment.  I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor	118:101,25K  !
3K	could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion	118:101,26K  !
3K	of testifying his respect towards any body connected with	118:101,27K  !
3K	the family."	118:101,28K  !
3H	"Lord, how tired I am|"	118:103,11H  !
3K	"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair	119:104,11K  !
3K	daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a	119:104,12K  !
3K	private audience with her in the course of this morning?"	119:104,13K  !
3D	"Oh dear| ~ Yes ~ certainly. ~ I am sure Lizzy will be	119:104,16D  !
3D	very happy ~ I am sure she can have no objection. ~ Come,	119:104,17D  !
3D	Kitty, I want you up stairs."	119:104,18D  !
3A	"Dear Ma'am, do not go. ~ I beg you will not go. ~	119:104,21A  !
3A	Mr% Collins must excuse me. ~ He can have nothing to	119:104,22A  !
3A	say to me that any body need not hear.  I am going away	119:104,23A  !
3A	myself."	119:104,24A  !
3D	"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. ~ I desire you will stay	119:104,25D  !
3D	where you are." ~	119:104,26D  !
3D	"Lizzy, I \insist\ upon your staying and hearing	119:104,28D  !
3D	Mr% Collins."	119:104,29D  !
3K	"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your	119:105, 5K  !
3K	modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather	119:105, 6K  !
3K	adds to your other perfections.  You would have been	119:105, 7K  !
3K	less amiable in my eyes had there \not\ been this little	119:105, 8K  !
3K	unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have	119:105, 9K  !
3K	your respected mother's permission for this address.	119:105,10K  !
3K	You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,	119:105,11K  !
3K	however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble;	119:105,12K  !
3K	my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	119:105,13K  !
3K	Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out	119:105,14K  !
3K	as the companion of my future life.  But before I am run	119:105,15K  !
3K	away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will	119:105,16K  !
3K	be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying ~	119:105,17K  !
3K	and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the	119:105,18K  !
3K	design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."	119:105,19K  !
3K	"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it	119:105,25K  !
3K	a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances	119:105,26K  !
3K	(like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his	119:105,27K  !
3K	parish.  Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very	119:105,28K  !
3K	greatly to my happiness; and thirdly ~ which perhaps	119:105,29K  !
3K	I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular	119:105,30K  !
3K	advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom	119:105,31K  !
3K	I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has she	119:105,32K  !
3K	condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too|) on	119:105,33K  !
3K	this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night	119:105,34K  !
3K	before I left Hunsford ~ between our pools at quadrille,	119:105,35K  !
3K	while Mrs% Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's	119:105,36K  !
3K	foot-stool, that she said,	119:105,37K  !
3K	Allow me, by the	119:106, 5K  !
3K	way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon	119:106, 6K  !
3K	the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh	119:106, 7K  !
3K	as among the least of the advantages in my power to	119:106, 8K  !
3K	offer.  You will find her manners beyond any thing I can	119:106, 9K  !
3K	describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be	119:106,10K  !
3K	acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the	119:106,11K  !
3K	silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	119:106,12K  !
3K	Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony;	119:106,13K  !
3K	it remains to be told why my views were directed	119:106,14K  !
3K	to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where	119:106,15K  !
3K	I assure you there are many amiable young women.	119:106,16K  !
3K	But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate	119:106,17K  !
3K	after the death of your honoured father, (who, however,	119:106,18K  !
3K	may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself	119:106,19K  !
3K	without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters,	119:106,20K  !
3K	that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when	119:106,21K  !
3K	the melancholy event takes place ~ which, however, as	119:106,22K  !
3K	I have already said, may not be for several years.  This	119:106,23K  !
3K	has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself	119:106,24K  !
3K	it will not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing	119:106,25K  !
3K	remains for me but to assure you in the most animated	119:106,26K  !
3K	language of the violence of my affection.  To fortune I am	119:106,27K  !
3K	perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that	119:106,28K  !
3K	nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could	119:106,29K  !
3K	not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds	119:106,30K  !
3K	in the 4 per cents% which will not be yours till after your	119:106,31K  !
3K	mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	119:106,32K  !
3K	On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and	119:106,33K  !
3K	you may assure youself that no ungenerous reproach	119:106,34K  !
3K	shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	119:106,35K  !
3A	"You are too hasty, Sir,"	119:106,37A  !
3A	"You forget that	119:106,37A  !
3A	I have made no answer.  Let me do it without farther	119:106,38A  !
3A	loss of time.  Accept my thanks for the compliment you	119:107, 1A  !
3A	are paying me.  I am very sensible of the honour of your	119:107, 2A  !
3A	proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise	119:107, 3A  !
3A	than decline them."	119:107, 4A  !
3K	"I am not now to learn,"	119:107, 5K  !
3K	"that it is usual with young	119:107, 6K  !
3K	ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they	119:107, 7K  !
3K	secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their	119:107, 8K  !
3K	favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a	119:107, 9K  !
3K	second or even a third time.  I am therefore by no means	119:107,10K  !
3K	discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope	119:107,11K  !
3K	to lead you to the altar ere long."	119:107,12K  !
3A	"Upon my word, Sir,"	119:107,13A  !
3A	"your hope is	119:107,13A  !
3A	rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.  I do	119:107,14A  !
3A	assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such	119:107,15A  !
3A	young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their	119:107,16A  !
3A	happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.	119:107,17A  !
3A	I am perfectly serious in my refusal. ~ You could not	119:107,18A  !
3A	make \me\ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last	119:107,19A  !
3A	woman in the world who would make \you\ so. ~ Nay, were	119:107,20A  !
3A	your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded	119:107,21A  !
3A	she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the	119:107,22A  !
3A	situation."	119:107,23A  !
3K	"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,"	119:107,24K  !
3K	"but I cannot imagine	119:107,25K  !
3K	that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.  And	119:107,26K  !
3K	you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing	119:107,27K  !
3K	her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your	119:107,28K  !
3K	modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications."	119:107,29K  !
3A	"Indeed, Mr% Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	119:107,30A  !
3A	You must give me leave to judge for myself, and	119:107,31A  !
3A	pay me the compliment of believing what I say.  I wish	119:107,32A  !
3A	you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand,	119:107,33A  !
3A	do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.  In	119:107,34A  !
3A	making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy	119:107,35A  !
3A	of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take	119:107,36A  !
3A	possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without	119:107,37A  !
3A	any self-reproach.  This matter may be considered, therefore,	119:107,38A  !
3A	as finally settled."	119:108, 1A  !
3K	"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you	119:108, 4K  !
3K	next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable	119:108, 5K  !
3K	answer than you have now given me; though I am	119:108, 6K  !
3K	far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because	119:108, 7K  !
3K	I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject	119:108, 8K  !
3K	a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even	119:108, 9K  !
3K	now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent	119:108,10K  !
3K	with the true delicacy of the female character."	119:108,11K  !
3A	"Really, Mr% Collins,"	119:108,12A  !
3A	"you puzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have	119:108,13A  !
3A	hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement,	119:108,14A  !
3A	I know not how to express my refusal in such a way	119:108,15A  !
3A	as may convince you of its being one."	119:108,16A  !
3K	"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear	119:108,17K  !
3K	cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely	119:108,18K  !
3K	words of course.  My reasons for believing it are briefly	119:108,19K  !
3K	these: ~ It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy	119:108,20K  !
3K	your acceptance, or that the establishment I can	119:108,21K  !
3K	offer would be any other than highly desirable.  My	119:108,22K  !
3K	situation in life, my connections with the family of	119:108,23K  !
3K	De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances	119:108,24K  !
3K	highly in my favour; and you should take	119:108,25K  !
3K	it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold	119:108,26K  !
3K	attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer	119:108,27K  !
3K	of marriage may ever be made you.  Your portion is	119:108,28K  !
3K	unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the	119:108,29K  !
3K	effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.  As	119:108,30K  !
3K	I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your	119:108,31K  !
3K	rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish	119:108,32K  !
3K	of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual	119:108,33K  !
3K	practice of elegant females."	119:108,34K  !
3A	"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension	119:108,35A  !
3A	whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in	119:108,36A  !
3A	tormenting a respectable man.  I would rather be paid	119:108,37A  !
3A	the compliment of being believed sincere.  I thank you	119:109, 1A  !
3A	again and again for the honour you have done me in	119:109, 2A  !
3A	your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.	119:109, 3A  !
3A	My feelings in every respect forbid it.  Can	119:109, 4A  !
3A	I speak plainer?  Do not consider me now as an elegant	119:109, 5A  !
3A	female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature	119:109, 6A  !
3A	speaking the truth from her heart."	119:109, 7A  !
3K	"You are uniformly charming|"	119:109, 9K  !
3K	"and I am persuaded that when	119:109,10K  !
3K	sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent	119:109,11K  !
3K	parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."	119:109,12K  !
3D	"But depend upon it, Mr% Collins,"	120:110,20D  !
3D	"that	120:110,20D  !
3D	Lizzy shall be brought to reason.  I will speak to her	120:110,21D  !
3D	about it myself directly.  She is a very headstrong foolish	120:110,22D  !
3D	girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will	120:110,23D  !
3D	\make\ her know it."	120:110,24D  !
3K	"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,"	120:110,25K  !
3K	"but if she is really headstrong and foolish,	120:110,26K  !
3K	I know not whether she would altogether be a very	120:110,27K  !
3K	desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally	120:110,28K  !
3K	looks for happiness in the marriage state.  If therefore	120:110,29K  !
3K	she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were	120:110,30K  !
3K	better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable	120:110,31K  !
3K	to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much	120:110,32K  !
3K	to my felicity."	120:110,33K  !
3D	"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,"	120:111, 1D  !

3D	these.  In every thing else she is as good natured a girl	120:111, 3D  !

3D	shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."	120:111, 5D  !
3D	"Oh| Mr% Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we	120:111, 9D  !

3D	marry Mr% Collins, for she vows she will not have him,	120:111,11D  !
3D	and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and	120:111,12D  !
3D	not have \her\."	120:111,13D  !
3C	"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,"	120:111,17C  !
3C	"Of what are you	120:111,19C  !
3C	talking?"	120:111,19C  !
3D	"Of Mr% Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not	120:111,20D  !

3D	will not have Lizzy."	120:111,22D  !
3C	"And what am I to do on the occasion? ~ It seems an	120:111,23C  !
3C	hopeless business."	120:111,24C  !

3C	"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand	120:111,31C  !
3C	that Mr% Collins has made you an offer of marriage.	120:111,32C  !
3C	Is it true?"	120:111,33C  !
3C	"Very well ~	120:111,33C  !
3C	and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	120:111,34C  !
3A	"I have, Sir."	120:111,35A  !
3C	"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother	120:111,36C  !

3K	"to	120:114,12K  !
3K	resent the behaviour of your daughter.  Resignation to	120:114,13K  !
3K	inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty	120:114,14K  !
3K	of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been	120:114,15K  !
3K	in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.  Perhaps	120:114,16K  !
3K	not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness	120:114,17K  !
3K	had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;	120:114,18K  !
3K	for I have often observed that resignation is never so	120:114,19K  !
3K	perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat	120:114,20K  !
3K	of its value in our estimation.  You will not, I hope,	120:114,21K  !
3K	consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family,	120:114,22K  !
3K	my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to	120:114,23K  !
3K	your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and	120:114,24K  !
3K	Mr% Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose	120:114,25K  !
3K	your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may	120:114,26K  !
3K	I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission	120:114,27K  !
3K	from your daughter's lips instead of your own.  But we	120:114,28K  !
3K	are all liable to error.  I have certainly meant well through	120:114,29K  !
3K	the whole affair.  My object has been to secure an amiable	120:114,30K  !
3K	companion for myself, with due consideration for the	120:114,31K  !
3K	advantage of all your family, and if my \manner\ has been	120:114,32K  !
3K	at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."	120:114,33K  !
3V	"I found,"	121:115,27V  !
3V	"as the time drew near, that I had	121:115,27V  !
3V	better not meet Mr% Darcy; ~ that to be in the same	121:115,28V  !
3V	room, the same party with him for so many hours together,	121:115,29V  !
3V	might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might	121:115,30V  !

3E	"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has	121:116,22E  !

3E	Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town;	121:116,24E  !
3E	and without any intention of coming back again.  You	121:116,25E  !
3E	shall hear what she says."	121:116,26E  !
3J	"I do not pretend	121:116,31J  !
3J	to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except	121:116,32J  !
3J	your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at	121:116,33J  !
3J	some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful	121:116,34J  !
3J	intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may	121:116,35J  !
3J	lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most	121:116,36J  !
3J	unreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that."	121:116,37J  !
3A	"It is unlucky,"	121:117, 7A  !
3A	"that	121:117, 7A  !
3A	you should not be able to see your friends before they	121:117, 8A  !

3A	of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward,	121:117,10A  !
3A	may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful	121:117,11A  !
3A	intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed	121:117,12A  !
3A	with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? ~ Mr% Bingley will	121:117,13A  !
3A	not be detained in London by them."	121:117,14A  !

3E	return into Hertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to	121:117,16E  !
3E	you ~	121:117,17E  !
3J	"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined	121:117,18J  !
3J	that the business which took him to London, might be	121:117,19J  !
3J	concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain	121:117,20J  !
3J	it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that	121:117,21J  !
3J	when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave	121:117,22J  !
3J	it again, we have determined on following him thither,	121:117,23J  !
3J	that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in	121:117,24J  !
3J	a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintance are already	121:117,25J  !
3J	there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my	121:117,26J  !
3J	dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the	121:117,27J  !
3J	croud, but of that I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas	121:117,28J  !
3J	in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which	121:117,29J  !
3J	that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be	121:117,30J  !
3J	so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three,	121:117,31J  !
3J	of whom we shall deprive you."	121:117,32J  !
3E	"It is evident by this,"	121:117,33E  !
3E	"that he comes	121:117,33E  !
3E	back no more this winter."	121:117,34E  !
3A	"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean	121:117,35A  !
3A	he \should\."	121:117,36A  !
3E	"Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing. ~	121:117,37E  !
3E	He is his own master.  But you do not know \all\.  I \will\	121:117,38E  !
3E	read you the passage which particularly hurts me.  I will	121:118, 1E  !
3E	have no reserves from \you\."	121:118, 2E  !
3J	"Mr% Darcy is impatient	121:118, 2J  !
3J	to see his sister, and to confess the truth, \we\ are	121:118, 3J  !
3J	scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do	121:118, 4J  !
3J	not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty,	121:118, 5J  !
3J	elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she	121:118, 6J  !
3J	inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something	121:118, 7J  !
3J	still more interesting, from the hope we dare to	121:118, 8J  !
3J	entertain of her being hereafter our sister.  I do not	121:118, 9J  !
3J	know whether I ever before mentioned to you my	121:118,10J  !
3J	feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country	121:118,11J  !
3J	without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem	121:118,12J  !
3J	them unreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly	121:118,13J  !
3J	already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing	121:118,14J  !
3J	her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish	121:118,15J  !
3J	the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality	121:118,16J  !
3J	is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most	121:118,17J  !
3J	capable of engaging any woman's heart.  With all these	121:118,18J  !
3J	circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent	121:118,19J  !
3J	it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope	121:118,20J  !
3J	of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"	121:118,21J  !
3E	"What think you of \this\ sentence, my dear Lizzy?" ~	121:118,22E  !
3E	"Is it not clear enough? ~	121:118,23E  !
3E	Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects	121:118,24E  !
3E	nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced	121:118,25E  !
3E	of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects	121:118,26E  !
3E	the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly|)	121:118,27E  !
3E	to put me on my guard?  Can there be any other opinion	121:118,28E  !
3E	on the subject?"	121:118,29E  !
3A	"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.  ~ Will	121:118,30A  !
3A	you hear it?"	121:118,31A  !
3E	"Most willingly."	121:118,32E  !
3A	"You shall have it in few words.  Miss Bingley sees	121:118,33A  !
3A	that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to	121:118,34A  !
3A	marry Miss Darcy.  She follows him to town in the hope	121:118,35A  !
3A	of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he	121:118,36A  !
3A	does not care about you."	121:118,37A  !
3A	"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. ~ No one who	121:119, 1A  !
3A	has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley	121:119, 2A  !
3A	I am sure cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.	121:119, 3A  !
3A	Could she have seen half as much love in Mr% Darcy for	121:119, 4A  !
3A	herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.  But	121:119, 5A  !
3A	the case is this.  We are not rich enough, or grand enough	121:119, 6A  !
3A	for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy	121:119, 7A  !
3A	for her brother, from the notion that when there has been	121:119, 8A  !
3A	\one\ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving	121:119, 9A  !
3A	a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and	121:119,10A  !
3A	I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out	121:119,11A  !
3A	of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously	121:119,12A  !
3A	imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother	121:119,13A  !
3A	greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree	121:119,14A  !
3A	less sensible of \your\ merit than when he took leave of you	121:119,15A  !
3A	on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade	121:119,16A  !
3A	him that instead of being in love with you, he is very	121:119,17A  !
3A	much in love with her friend."	121:119,18A  !
3E	"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"	121:119,19E  !
3E	"your representation of all this, might make me quite	121:119,20E  !
3E	easy.  But I know the foundation is unjust.  Caroline is	121:119,21E  !
3E	incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that	121:119,22E  !
3E	I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself."	121:119,23E  !
3A	"That is right. ~ You could not have started a more	121:119,24A  !
3A	happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.	121:119,25A  !
3A	Believe her to be deceived by all means.  You have now	121:119,26A  !
3A	done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	121:119,27A  !
3E	"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing	121:119,28E  !
3E	the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are	121:119,29E  !
3E	all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"	121:119,30E  !
3A	"You must decide for yourself,"	121:119,31A  !
3A	"and	121:119,31A  !
3A	if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of	121:119,32A  !
3A	disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the	121:119,33A  !
3A	happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means	121:119,34A  !
3A	to refuse him."	121:119,35A  !
3E	"How can you talk so?" ~	121:119,36E  !
3E	"You must know that though I should be exceedingly	121:119,37E  !
3E	grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."	121:119,38E  !
3A	"I did not think you would; ~ and that being the case,	121:120, 1A  !
3A	I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."	121:120, 2A  !
3E	"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will	121:120, 3E  !
3E	never be required.  A thousand things may arise in six	121:120, 4E  !
3E	months|"	121:120, 5E  !
3A	"It keeps him in good humour,"	122:121, 4A  !
3A	"and I am more obliged to you than I can	122:121, 5A  !
3A	express."	122:121, 6A  !
3K	"My dear Madam,"	122:123,25K  !
3K	"this invitation is	122:123,25K  !
3K	particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been	122:123,26K  !
3K	hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I	122:123,27K  !
3K	shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."	122:123,28K  !
3C	"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation	122:123,31C  !
3C	here, my good sir? ~ You had better neglect your	122:123,32C  !
3C	relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness."	122:123,33C  !
3K	"My dear sir,"	122:123,34K  !
3K	"I am particularly	122:123,34K  !
3K	obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may	122:123,35K  !
3K	depend upon my not taking so material a step without her	122:123,36K  !
3K	ladyship's concurrence."	122:123,37K  !
3C	"You cannot be too much on your guard.  Risk	122:123,38C  !
3C	any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it	122:124, 1C  !
3C	likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I	122:124, 2C  !
3C	should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,	122:124, 3C  !
3C	and be satisfied that \we\ shall take no offence."	122:124, 4C  !
3K	"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly	122:124, 5K  !
3K	excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon	122:124, 6K  !
3K	it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for	122:124, 7K  !
3K	this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during	122:124, 8K  !
3K	my stay in Hertfordshire.  As for my fair cousins, though	122:124, 9K  !
3K	my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary,	122:124,10K  !
3K	I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and	122:124,11K  !
3K	happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."	122:124,12K  !

3E	repine.  It cannot last long.  He will be forgot, and we	201:134,21E  !
3E	shall all be as we were before."	201:134,22E  !

3E	Consider Mr% Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's	201:135,22E  !
3E	prudent, steady character.  Remember that she is one of	201:135,23E  !
3E	a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible	201:135,24E  !
3E	match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake,	201:135,25E  !

3A	as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any	201:135,30A  !
3A	regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding,	201:135,31A  !
3A	than I now do of her heart.  My dear Jane,	201:135,32A  !
3A	Mr% Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly	201:135,33A  !
3A	man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must	201:135,34A  !
3A	feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him,	201:135,35A  !
3A	cannot have a proper way of thinking.  You shall not	201:135,36A  !
3A	defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall	201:135,37A  !
3A	not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning	201:135,38A  !
3A	of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade	201:136, 1A  !
3A	yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility	201:136, 2A  !
3A	of danger, security for happiness."	201:136, 3A  !
3E	"I must think your language too strong in speaking	201:136, 4E  !
3E	of both,"	201:136, 5E  !
3E	"and I hope you will be convinced	201:136, 5E  !
3E	of it, by seeing them happy together.  But enough of this.	201:136, 6E  !
3E	You alluded to something else.  You mentioned \two\	201:136, 7E  !
3E	instances.  I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat	201:136, 8E  !
3E	you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking \that\ \person\	201:136, 9E  !
3E	to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.  We	201:136,10E  !
3E	must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally	201:136,11E  !
3E	injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to be	201:136,12E  !
3E	always so guarded and circumspect.  It is very often	201:136,13E  !
3E	nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.  Woman	201:136,14E  !
3E	fancy admiration means more than it does."	201:136,15E  !
3A	"And men take care that they should."	201:136,16A  !
3E	"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified;	201:136,17E  !
3E	but I have no idea of there being so much design in the	201:136,18E  !
3E	world as some persons imagine."	201:136,19E  !
3A	"I am far from attributing any part of Mr% Bingley's	201:136,20A  !
3A	conduct to design,"	201:136,21A  !
3A	"but without	201:136,21A  !
3A	scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there	201:136,22A  !
3A	may be error, and there may be misery.  Thoughtlessness,	201:136,23A  !
3A	want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of	201:136,24A  !
3A	resolution, will do the business."	201:136,25A  !
3E	"And do you impute it to either of those?'	201:136,26E  !
3A	"Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease	201:136,27A  !
3A	you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.  Stop	201:136,28A  !
3A	me whilst you can."	201:136,29A  !
3E	"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence	201:136,30E  !
3E	him."	201:136,31E  !
3A	"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."	201:136,32A  !
3E	"I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence	201:136,33E  !
3E	him?  They can only wish his happiness, and if he is	201:136,34E  !
3E	attached to me, no other woman can secure it."	201:136,35E  !
3A	"Your first position is false.  They may wish many	201:136,36A  !
3A	things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase	201:136,37A  !
3A	of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry	201:136,38A  !
3A	a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections,	201:137, 1A  !
3A	and pride."	201:137, 2A  !
3E	"Beyond a doubt, they \do\ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,"	201:137, 3E  !
3E	"but this may be from better	201:137, 4E  !
3E	feelings than you are supposing.  They have known her	201:137, 5E  !
3E	much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they	201:137, 6E  !
3E	love her better.  But, whatever may be their own wishes,	201:137, 7E  !
3E	it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.	201:137, 8E  !
3E	What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless	201:137, 9E  !
3E	there were something very objectionable?  If they believed	201:137,10E  !
3E	him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he	201:137,11E  !
3E	were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an	201:137,12E  !
3E	affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and	201:137,13E  !
3E	wrong, and me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the	201:137,14E  !
3E	idea.  I am not ashamed of having been mistaken ~ or,	201:137,15E  !
3E	at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what	201:137,16E  !
3E	I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.  Let me	201:137,17E  !
3E	take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be	201:137,18E  !
3E	understood."	201:137,19E  !
3C	"So,	201:137,35C  !
3C	Lizzy,"	201:137,36C  !
3C	"your sister is crossed in love	201:137,36C  !
3C	I find.  I congratulate her.  Next to being married, a girl	201:137,37C  !
3C	likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.  It is	201:137,38C  !
3C	something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction	201:138, 1C  !
3C	among her companions.  When is your turn to come?	201:138, 2C  !
3C	You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now	201:138, 3C  !
3C	is your time.  Here are officers enough at Meryton to	201:138, 4C  !
3C	disappoint all the young ladies in the country.  Let	201:138, 5C  !
3C	Wickham be \your\ man.  He is a pleasant fellow, and would	201:138, 6C  !
3C	jilt you creditably."	201:138, 7C  !
3A	"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy	201:138, 8A  !
3A	me.  We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."	201:138, 9A  !
3C	"True,"	201:138,10C  !
3C	"but it is a comfort to think	201:138,10C  !
3C	that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an	201:138,11C  !
3C	affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."	201:138,12C  !
3D	"I do not blame Jane,"	202:140, 1D  !
3D	"for Jane	202:140, 1D  !
3D	would have got Mr% Bingley, if she could.  But, Lizzy|	202:140, 2D  !
3D	Oh, sister| it is very hard to think that she might have	202:140, 3D  !
3D	been Mr% Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for	202:140, 4D  !
3D	her own perverseness.  He made her an offer in this very	202:140, 5D  !
3D	room, and she refused him.  The consequence of it is,	202:140, 6D  !
3D	that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I	202:140, 7D  !
3D	have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed	202:140, 8D  !
3D	as ever.  The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.	202:140, 9D  !
3D	They are all for what they can get.  I am sorry to say	202:140,10D  !
3D	it of them, but so it is.  It makes me very nervous and	202:140,11D  !
3D	poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have	202:140,12D  !
3D	neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.	202:140,13D  !
3D	However, your coming just at this time is the greatest	202:140,14D  !
3D	of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell	202:140,15D  !
3D	us, of long sleeves."	202:140,16D  !
3O	"It seems likely to have been a desirable	202:140,22O  !
3O	match for Jane,"	202:140,23O  !
3O	"I am sorry it went off.	202:140,23O  !
3O	But these things happen so often|  A young man, such as	202:140,24O  !
3O	you describe Mr% Bingley, so easily falls in love with	202:140,25O  !
3O	a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates	202:140,26O  !
3O	them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies	202:140,27O  !
3O	are very frequent."	202:140,28O  !
3A	"An excellent consolation in its way,"	202:140,29A  !
3A	"but it will not do for \us\.  We do not suffer by \accident\.	202:140,30A  !
3A	It does not often happen that the interference of friends	202:140,31A  !
3A	will persuade a young man of independent fortune to	202:140,32A  !
3A	think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love	202:140,33A  !
3A	with only a few days before."	202:140,34A  !
3O	"But that expression of ""violently in love"" is so	202:140,35O  !
3O	hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me	202:140,36O  !
3O	very little idea.  It is as often applied to feelings which	202:140,37O  !
3O	arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real,	202:140,38O  !
3O	strong attachment.  Pray, how \violent\ \was\ Mr% Bingley's	202:141, 1O  !
3O	love?"	202:141, 2O  !
3A	"I never saw a more promising inclination.  He was	202:141, 3A  !
3A	growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly	202:141, 4A  !
3A	engrossed by her.  Every time they met, it was more	202:141, 5A  !
3A	decided and remarkable.  At his own ball he offended two	202:141, 6A  !
3A	or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and	202:141, 7A  !
3A	I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	202:141, 8A  !
3A	Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not general incivility	202:141, 9A  !
3A	the very essence of love?"	202:141,10A  !
3O	"Oh, yes| ~ of that kind of love which I suppose him	202:141,11O  !
3O	to have felt.  Poor Jane|  I am sorry for her, because,	202:141,12O  !
3O	with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.	202:141,13O  !
3O	It had better have happened to \you\, Lizzy; you would	202:141,14O  !
3O	have laughed yourself out of it sooner.  But do you think	202:141,15O  !
3O	she would be prevailed on to go back with us?  Change	202:141,16O  !
3O	of scene might be of service ~ and perhaps a little relief	202:141,17O  !
3O	from home, may be as useful as anything."	202:141,18O  !
3O	"I hope,"	202:141,21O  !
3O	"that no consideration	202:141,21O  !
3O	with regard to this young man will influence her.  We live	202:141,22O  !
3O	in so different a part of town, all our connections are so	202:141,23O  !
3O	different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that	202:141,24O  !
3O	it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he	202:141,25O  !
3O	really comes to see her."	202:141,26O  !
3A	"And \that\ is quite impossible; for he is now in the	202:141,27A  !
3A	custody of his friend, and Mr% Darcy would no more suffer	202:141,28A  !
3A	him to call on Jane in such a part of London|  My dear	202:141,29A  !
3A	aunt, how could you think of it?  Mr% Darcy may perhaps	202:141,30A  !
3A	have \heard\ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he	202:141,31A  !
3A	would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse	202:141,32A  !
3A	him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and	202:141,33A  !
3A	depend upon it, Mr% Bingley never stirs without him."	202:141,34A  !
3O	"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at	202:141,35O  !
3O	all.  But does not Jane correspond with the sister?  \She\	202:141,36O  !
3O	will not be able to help calling."	202:141,37O  !
3A	"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."	202:141,38A  !
3O	"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love	203:144, 5O  !
3O	merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore,	203:144, 6O  !
3O	I am not afraid of speaking openly.  Seriously, I would	203:144, 7O  !
3O	have you be on your guard.  Do not involve yourself,	203:144, 8O  !
3O	or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the	203:144, 9O  !
3O	want of fortune would make so very imprudent.  I have	203:144,10O  !
3O	nothing to say against \him\; he is a most interesting	203:144,11O  !
3O	young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have,	203:144,12O  !
3O	I should think you could not do better.  But as it is ~ you	203:144,13O  !
3O	must not let your fancy run away with you.  You have	203:144,14O  !
3O	sense, and we all expect you to use it.  Your father would	203:144,15O  !
3O	depend on \your\ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.	203:144,16O  !
3O	You must not disappoint your father."	203:144,17O  !
3A	"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	203:144,18A  !
3O	"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	203:144,19O  !
3A	"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will	203:144,21A  !
3A	take care of myself, and of Mr% Wickham too.  He shall	203:144,22A  !
3A	not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."	203:144,23A  !
3O	"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."	203:144,24O  !
3A	"I beg your pardon.  I will try again.  At present I am	203:144,25A  !
3A	not in love with Mr% Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	203:144,26A  !
3A	But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable	203:144,27A  !
3A	man I ever saw ~ and if he becomes really attached to me ~	203:144,28A  !
3A	I believe it will be better that he should not.  I see the	203:144,29A  !
3A	imprudence of it. ~ Oh| \that\ abominable Mr% Darcy| ~	203:144,30A  !
3A	My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honor;	203:144,31A  !
3A	and I should be miserable to forfeit it.  My father, however,	203:144,32A  !
3A	is partial to Mr% Wickham.  In short, my dear aunt,	203:144,33A  !
3A	I should be very sorry to be the means of making any	203:145, 1A  !
3A	of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where	203:145, 2A  !
3A	there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by	203:145, 3A  !
3A	immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements	203:145, 4A  !
3A	with each other, how can I promise to be wiser	203:145, 5A  !
3A	than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted,	203:145, 6A  !
3A	or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to	203:145, 7A  !
3A	resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to	203:145, 8A  !
3A	be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself	203:145, 9A  !
3A	his first object.  When I am in company with him, I will	203:145,10A  !
3A	not be wishing.  In short, I will do my best."	203:145,11A  !
3O	"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming	203:145,12O  !
3O	here so very often.  At least, you should not \remind\ your	203:145,13O  !
3O	Mother of inviting him."	203:145,14O  !
3A	"As I did the other day,"	203:145,15A  !
3A	"very true, it will be wise in me to	203:145,16A  !
3A	refrain from \that\.  But do not imagine that he is always	203:145,17A  !
3A	here so often.  It is on your account that he has been so	203:145,18A  !
3A	frequently invited this week.  You know my mother's	203:145,19A  !
3A	ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her	203:145,20A  !
3A	friends.  But really, and upon my honour, I will try to	203:145,21A  !
3A	do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are	203:145,22A  !
3A	satisfied."	203:145,23A  !
3D	"\wished\ they might be happy."	203:145,34D  !
3A	"\That\ you certainly shall."	203:146, 6A  !
3A	"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."	203:146, 9A  !
3E	"My aunt,"	203:147,14E  !
3E	"is going to-morrow into	203:147,14E  !
3E	that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity	203:147,15E  !
3E	of calling in Grosvenor-street."	203:147,16E  !
3E	"I did not think Caroline in spirits,"	203:147,18E  !
3E	"but she was very glad to see me, and	203:147,19E  !
3E	reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to	203:147,20E  !
3E	London.  I was right, therefore; my last letter had never	203:147,21E  !
3E	reached her.  I enquired after their brother, of course.	203:147,22E  !
3E	He was well, but so much engaged with Mr% Darcy, that	203:147,23E  !
3E	they scarcely ever saw him.  I found that Miss Darcy	203:147,24E  !
3E	was expected to dinner.  I wish I could see her.  My	203:147,25E  !
3E	visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs% Hurst were going	203:147,26E  !
3E	out.  I dare say I shall soon see them here."	203:147,27E  !
3E	"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of	203:148, 4E  !
3E	triumphing in her better judgment, at my expense, when	203:148, 5E  !
3E	I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's	203:148, 6E  !
3E	regard for me.  But, my dear sister, though	203:148, 7E  !
3E	the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate	203:148, 8E  !
3E	if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was,	203:148, 9E  !
3E	my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.  I do	203:148,10E  !
3E	not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate	203:148,11E  !
3E	with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen	203:148,12E  !
3E	again, I am sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline	203:148,13E  !
3E	did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note,	203:148,14E  !
3E	not a line, did I receive in the mean time.  When she did	203:148,15E  !
3E	come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;	203:148,16E  !
3E	she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before,	203:148,17E  !
3E	said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in	203:148,18E  !
3E	every respect so altered a creature, that when she went	203:148,19E  !
3E	away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance	203:148,20E  !
3E	no longer.  I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.	203:148,21E  !
3E	She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can	203:148,22E  !
3E	safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her	203:148,23E  !
3E	side.  But I pity her, because she must feel that she has	203:148,24E  !
3E	been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that	203:148,25E  !
3E	anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.  I need not	203:148,26E  !
3E	explain myself farther; and though \we\ know this anxiety	203:148,27E  !
3E	to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account	203:148,28E  !
3E	for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he	203:148,29E  !
3E	is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his	203:148,30E  !
3E	behalf, is natural and amiable.  I cannot but wonder,	203:148,31E  !
3E	however, at her having any such fears now, because, if	203:148,32E  !
3E	he had at all cared about me, we must have met long,	203:148,33E  !
3E	long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am certain,	203:148,34E  !
3E	from something she said herself; and yet it should seem	203:148,35E  !
3E	by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade	203:148,36E  !
3E	herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot	203:148,37E  !
3E	understand it.  If I were not afraid of judging harshly,	203:148,38E  !
3E	I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong	203:149, 1E  !
3E	appearance of duplicity in all this.  But I will endeavour	203:149, 2E  !
3E	to banish every painful thought, and think only of what	203:149, 3E  !
3E	will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable	203:149, 4E  !
3E	kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear from	203:149, 5E  !
3E	you very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never	203:149, 6E  !
3E	returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house,	203:149, 7E  !
3E	but not with any certainty.  We had better not mention it.	203:149, 8E  !
3E	I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts	203:149, 9E  !
3E	from our friends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with	203:149,10E  !
3E	Sir William and Maria.  I am sure you will be very	203:149,11E  !
3E	comfortable there.	203:149,12E  !
3E	"Your's, &c%"	203:149,13E  !
3A	"I am	203:150, 8A  !
3A	now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much	203:150, 9A  !
3A	in love; for had I really experienced that pure and	203:150,10A  !
3A	elevating passion, I should at present detest his very	203:150,11A  !
3A	name, and wish him all manner of evil.  But my feelings	203:150,12A  !
3A	are not only cordial towards \him\; they are even impartial	203:150,13A  !
3A	towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I hate her	203:150,14A  !
3A	at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her	203:150,15A  !
3A	a very good sort of girl.  There can be no love in all this.	203:150,16A  !
3A	My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should	203:150,17A  !
3A	certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance,	203:150,18A  !
3A	were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say	203:150,19A  !
3A	that I regret my comparative insignificance.  Importance	203:150,20A  !
3A	may sometimes be purchased too dearly.  Kitty and Lydia	203:150,21A  !
3A	take his defection much more to heart than I do.  They are	203:150,22A  !
3A	young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the	203:150,23A  !
3A	mortifying conviction that handsome young men must	203:150,24A  !
3A	have something to live on, as well as the plain."	203:150,25A  !
3O	"But, my dear Elizabeth,"	204:153, 6O  !
3O	"what sort of	204:153, 6O  !
3O	girl is Miss King?  I should be sorry to think our friend	204:153, 7O  !
3O	mercenary."	204:153, 8O  !
3A	"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial	204:153, 9A  !
3A	affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent	204:153,10A  !
3A	motive?  Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	204:153,11A  !
3A	Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,	204:153,12A  !
3A	because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is	204:153,13A  !
3A	trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you	204:153,14A  !
3A	want to find out that he is mercenary."	204:153,15A  !
3O	"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is,	204:153,16O  !
3O	I shall know what to think."	204:153,17O  !
3A	"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no	204:153,18A  !
3A	harm of her."	204:153,19A  !
3O	"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her	204:153,20O  !
3O	grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."	204:153,21O  !
3A	"No ~ why should he?  If it was not allowable for	204:153,22A  !
3A	him to gain \my\ affections, because I had no money, what	204:153,23A  !
3A	occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom	204:153,24A  !
3A	he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"	204:153,25A  !
3O	"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions	204:153,26O  !
3O	towards her, so soon after this event."	204:153,27O  !
3A	"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for	204:153,28A  !
3A	all those elegant decorums which other people may	204:153,29A  !
3A	observe.  If \she\ does not object to it, why should \we\?"	204:153,30A  !
3O	"\Her\ not objecting, does not justify \him\.  It only	204:153,31O  !
3O	shews her being deficient in something herself ~ sense or	204:153,32O  !
3O	feeling."	204:153,33O  !
3A	"Well,"	204:153,34A  !
3A	"have it as you choose.  \He\	204:153,34A  !
3A	shall be mercenary, and \she\ shall be foolish."	204:153,35A  !
3O	"No, Lizzy, that is what I do \not\ choose.  I should be	204:153,36O  !
3O	sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived	204:153,37O  !
3O	so long in Derbyshire."	204:153,38O  !
3A	"Oh| if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young	204:154, 1A  !
3A	men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends	204:154, 2A  !
3A	who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick	204:154, 3A  !
3A	of them all.  Thank Heaven|  I am going to-morrow where	204:154, 4A  !
3A	I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who	204:154, 5A  !
3A	has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.  Stupid	204:154, 6A  !
3A	men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."	204:154, 7A  !
3O	"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of	204:154, 8O  !
3O	disappointment."	204:154, 9O  !
3O	"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry	204:154,14O  !
3O	us,"	204:154,15O  !
3O	"but perhaps to the Lakes."	204:154,16O  !
3A	"My dear, dear aunt,"	204:154,19A  !
3A	"what delight| what felicity|  You give me fresh life	204:154,20A  !
3A	and vigour.  Adieu to disappointment and spleen.  What	204:154,21A  !
3A	are men to rocks and mountains?  Oh| what hours of	204:154,22A  !
3A	transport we shall spend|  And when we \do\ return, it shall	204:154,23A  !
3A	not be like other travellers, without being able to give	204:154,24A  !
3A	one accurate idea of any thing.  We \will\ know where we	204:154,25A  !
3A	have gone ~ we \will\ recollect what we have seen.  Lakes,	204:154,26A  !
3A	mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our	204:154,27A  !
3A	imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any	204:154,28A  !
3A	particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative	204:154,29A  !
3A	situation.  Let \our\ first effusions be less insupportable	204:154,30A  !
3A	than those of the generality of travellers."	204:154,31A  !
3K	"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of	205:157,13K  !
3K	seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday	205:157,14K  !
3K	at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with	205:157,15K  !
3K	her.  She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not	205:157,16K  !
3K	but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice	205:157,17K  !
3K	when service is over.  I have scarcely any hesitation in saying	205:157,18K  !
3K	that she will include you and my sister Maria in every	205:157,19K  !
3K	invitation with which she honours us during your stay	205:157,20K  !
3K	here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.	205:157,21K  !
3K	We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never	205:157,22K  !
3K	allowed to walk home.  Her ladyship's carriage is regularly	205:157,23K  !
3K	ordered for us.  I \should\ say, one of her ladyship's carriages,	205:157,24K  !
3K	for she has several."	205:157,25K  !
3K	"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She	205:157,29K  !
3K	is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too	205:157,30K  !
3K	much deference."	205:157,31K  !
3A	"And is this all?"	205:158,21A  !
3A	"I expected at	205:158,21A  !
3A	least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is	205:158,22A  !
3A	nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter|"	205:158,23A  !
3A	"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors	205:158,30A  !
3A	in all this wind.  Why does she not come in?"	205:158,31A  !
3A	"I like her appearance,"	205:158,34A  !
3A	"She looks sickly and cross. ~ Yes, she will	205:158,35A  !
3A	do for him very well.  She will make him a very proper	205:158,36A  !
3A	wife."	205:158,37A  !
3K	"I confess,"	206:160, 9K  !
3K	"that I should not have been at	206:160, 9K  !
3K	all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to	206:160,10K  !
3K	drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.  I rather	206:160,11K  !
3K	expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it	206:160,12K  !
3K	would happen.  But who could have foreseen such an	206:160,13K  !
3K	attention as this?  Who could have imagined that we	206:160,14K  !
3K	should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation	206:160,15K  !
3K	moreover including the whole party) so immediately after	206:160,16K  !
3K	your arrival|"	206:160,17K  !
3K	"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about	206:160,30K  !
3K	your apparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that	206:160,31K  !
3K	elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.	206:160,32K  !
3K	I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your	206:160,33K  !
3K	clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for	206:161, 1K  !
3K	any thing more.  Lady Catherine will not think the worse	206:161, 2K  !
3K	of you for being simply dressed.  She likes to have the	206:161, 3K  !
3K	distinction of rank preserved."	206:161, 4K  !
3L	"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr% Collins, I think.	206:164, 8L  !
3L	For your sake,"	206:164, 9L  !
3L	"I am glad of it;	206:164, 9L  !
3L	but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from	206:164,10L  !
3L	the female line. ~ It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's	206:164,11L  !
3L	family. ~ Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"	206:164,12L  !
3A	"A little."	206:164,14A  !
3L	"Oh| then ~ some time or other we shall be happy to	206:164,15L  !
3L	hear you.  Our instrument is a capital one, probably	206:164,16L  !
3L	superior to ~ You shall try it some day. ~ Do your sisters	206:164,17L  !
3L	play and sing?"	206:164,18L  !
3A	"One of them does."	206:164,19A  !
3L	"Why did not you all learn? ~ You ought all to have	206:164,20L  !
3L	learned.  The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has	206:164,21L  !
3L	not so good an income as your's. ~ Do you draw?"	206:164,22L  !
3A	"No, not at all."	206:164,23A  !
3L	"What, none of you?"	206:164,24L  !
3A	"Not one."	206:164,25A  !
3L	"That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no	206:164,26L  !
3L	opportunity.  Your mother should have taken you to	206:164,27L  !
3L	town every spring for the benefit of masters."	206:164,28L  !
3A	"My mother would have had no objection, but my	206:164,29A  !
3A	father hates London."	206:164,30A  !
3L	"Has your governess left you?"	206:164,31L  !
3A	"We never had any governess."	206:164,32A  !
3L	"No governess|  How was that possible?  Five	206:164,33L  !
3L	daughters brought up at home without a governess| ~	206:164,34L  !
3L	I never heard of such a thing.  Your mother must have	206:164,35L  !
3L	been quite a slave to your education."	206:164,36L  !
3L	"Then, who taught you? who attended to you?	206:165, 1L  !
3L	Without a governess you must have been neglected."	206:165, 2L  !
3A	"Compared with some families, I believe we were;	206:165, 3A  !
3A	but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the	206:165, 4A  !
3A	means.  We were always encouraged to read, and had	206:165, 5A  !
3A	all the masters that were necessary.  Those who chose	206:165, 6A  !
3A	to be idle, certainly might."	206:165, 7A  !
3L	"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will	206:165, 8L  !
3L	prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have	206:165, 9L  !
3L	advised her most strenuously to engage one.  I always	206:165,10L  !
3L	say that nothing is to be done in education without steady	206:165,11L  !
3L	and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can	206:165,12L  !
3L	give it.  It was wonderful how many families I have been	206:165,13L  !
3L	the means of supplying in that way.  I am always glad	206:165,14L  !
3L	to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces of	206:165,15L  !
3L	Mrs% Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my	206:165,16L  !
3L	means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended	206:165,17L  !
3L	another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned	206:165,18L  !
3L	to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.	206:165,19L  !
3L	Mrs% Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling	206:165,20L  !
3L	yesterday to thank me?  She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	206:165,21L  !
3L	""Lady Catherine,"" said she, ""you have given me a treasure.""	206:165,22L  !
3L	Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"	206:165,23L  !
3A	"Yes, Ma'am, all."	206:165,24A  !
3L	"All| ~ What, all five out at once?  Very odd| ~ And	206:165,25L  !
3L	you only the second. ~ The younger ones out before the	206:165,26L  !
3L	elder are married| ~ Your younger sisters must be very	206:165,27L  !
3L	young?"	206:165,28L  !
3A	"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps \she\ is full	206:165,29A  !
3A	young to be much in company.  But really, Ma'am,	206:165,30A  !
3A	I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that	206:165,31A  !
3A	they should not have their share of society and amusement	206:165,32A  !
3A	because the elder may not have the means or inclination	206:165,33A  !
3A	to marry early. ~ The last born has as good a right to the	206:165,34A  !
3A	pleasures of youth, as the first.  And to be kept back on	206:165,35A  !
3A	\such\ a motive| ~ I think it would not be very likely to	206:165,36A  !
3A	promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."	206:165,37A  !
3L	"Upon my word,"	206:165,38L  !
3L	"you give your	206:165,38L  !
3L	opinion very decidedly for so young a person. ~ Pray, what	206:166, 1L  !
3L	is your age?"	206:166, 2L  !
3A	"With three younger sisters grown up,"	206:166, 3A  !
3A	"your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own	206:166, 4A  !
3A	it."	206:166, 5A  !
3L	"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, ~ therefore	206:166,10L  !
3L	you need not conceal your age."	206:166,11L  !
3A	"I am not one and twenty."	206:166,12A  !
3A	"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.	207:171,16A  !
3A	Have you never happened to see her there?"	207:171,17A  !
3L	"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is	208:173, 3L  !
3L	it you are talking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?	208:173, 4L  !
3L	Let me hear what it is."	208:173, 5L  !
3L	"Of music|  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all	208:173, 8L  !
3L	subjects my delight.  I must have my share in the conversation,	208:173, 9L  !
3L	if you are speaking of music.  There are few	208:173,10L  !
3L	people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment	208:173,11L  !
3L	of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	208:173,12L  !
3L	If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.	208:173,13L  !
3L	And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.	208:173,14L  !
3L	I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.	208:173,15L  !
3L	How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"	208:173,16L  !
3L	"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,"	208:173,19L  !
3L	"and pray tell her from me, that	208:173,20L  !
3L	she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great	208:173,21L  !
3L	deal."	208:173,22L  !
3B	"I assure you, Madam,"	208:173,23B  !
3B	"that she does	208:173,23B  !
3B	not need such advice.  She practises very constantly."	208:173,24B  !
3L	"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much;	208:173,25L  !
3L	and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to	208:173,26L  !
3L	neglect it on any account.  I often tell young ladies,	208:173,27L  !
3L	that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without	208:173,28L  !
3L	constant practice.  I have told Miss Bennet several times,	208:173,29L  !
3L	that she will never play really well, unless she practices	208:173,30L  !
3L	more; and though Mrs% Collins has no instrument, she	208:173,31L  !
3L	is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to	208:173,32L  !
3L	Rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in Mrs% Jenkinson's	208:173,33L  !
3L	room.  She would be in nobody's way, you	208:173,34L  !
3L	know, in that part of the house."	208:173,35L  !
3A	"You mean to frighten me, Mr% Darcy, by coming in	208:174,11A  !
3A	all this state to hear me?  But I will not be alarmed	208:174,12A  !
3A	though your sister \does\ play so well.  There is a stubbornness	208:174,13A  !
3A	about me that never can bear to be frightened at	208:174,14A  !
3A	the will of others.  My courage always rises with every	208:174,15A  !
3A	attempt to intimidate me."	208:174,16A  !
3B	"I shall not say that you are mistaken,"	208:174,17B  !
3B	"because you could not really believe me to entertain	208:174,18B  !
3B	any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure	208:174,19B  !
3B	of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find	208:174,20B  !
3B	great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which	208:174,21B  !
3B	in fact are not your own."	208:174,22B  !
3A	"Your cousin will give	208:174,24A  !
3A	you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to	208:174,25A  !
3A	believe a word I say.  I am particularly unlucky in meeting	208:174,26A  !
3A	with a person so well able to expose my real character,	208:174,27A  !
3A	in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself	208:174,28A  !
3A	off with some degree of credit.  Indeed, Mr% Darcy, it is	208:174,29A  !
3A	very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to	208:174,30A  !
3A	my disadvantage in Hertfordshire ~ and, give me leave	208:174,31A  !
3A	to say, very impolitic too ~ for it is provoking me to	208:174,32A  !
3A	retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock	208:174,33A  !
3A	your relations to hear."	208:174,34A  !
3B	"I am not afraid of you,"	208:174,35B  !
3A	"You shall hear then ~ but prepare yourself for something	208:175, 1A  !
3A	very dreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing	208:175, 2A  !
3A	him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball ~	208:175, 3A  !
3A	and at this ball, what do you think he did?  He danced	208:175, 4A  !
3A	only four dances|  I am sorry to pain you ~ but so it was.	208:175, 5A  !
3A	He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were	208:175, 6A  !
3A	scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one	208:175, 7A  !
3A	young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.  Mr% Darcy,	208:175, 8A  !
3A	you cannot deny the fact."	208:175, 9A  !
3B	"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any	208:175,10B  !
3B	lady in the assembly beyond my own party."	208:175,11B  !
3A	"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	208:175,12A  !
3A	Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	208:175,13A  !
3A	My fingers wait your orders."	208:175,14A  !
3B	"Perhaps,"	208:175,15B  !
3B	"I should have judged better,	208:175,15B  !
3B	had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to	208:175,16B  !
3B	recommend myself to strangers."	208:175,17B  !
3A	"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	208:175,18A  !
3A	"Shall	208:175,19A  !
3A	we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who	208:175,20A  !
3A	has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself	208:175,21A  !
3A	to strangers?"	208:175,22A  !
3B	"I certainly have not the talent which some people	208:175,26B  !
3B	possess,"	208:175,27B  !
3B	"of conversing easily with those	208:175,27B  !
3B	I have never seen before.  I cannot catch their tone of	208:175,28B  !
3B	conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as	208:175,29B  !
3B	I often see done."	208:175,30B  !
3A	"My fingers,"	208:175,31A  !
3A	"do not move over this	208:175,31A  !
3A	instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many	208:175,32A  !
3A	women's do.  They have not the same force or rapidity,	208:175,33A  !
3A	and do not produce the same expression.  But then I have	208:175,34A  !
3A	always supposed it to be my own fault ~ because I would	208:175,35A  !
3A	not take the trouble of practising.  It is not that I do not	208:175,36A  !
3A	believe \my\ fingers as capable as any other woman's of	208:175,37A  !
3A	superior execution."	208:175,38A  !
3B	"You are perfectly right.  You	208:176, 1B  !
3B	have employed your time much better.  No one admitted	208:176, 2B  !
3B	to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.	208:176, 3B  !
3B	We neither of us perform to strangers."	208:176, 4B  !
3L	"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised	208:176,10L  !
3L	more, and could have the advantage of a London	208:176,11L  !
3L	master.  She has a very good notion of fingering, though	208:176,12L  !
3L	her taste is not equal to Anne's.  Anne would have been	208:176,13L  !
3L	a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to	208:176,14L  !
3L	learn."	208:176,15L  !
3A	"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last	209:177,21A  !
3A	November, Mr% Darcy|  It must have been a most agreeable	209:177,22A  !
3A	surprise to Mr% Bingley to see you all after him so	209:177,23A  !
3A	soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day	209:177,24A  !
3A	before.  He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you	209:177,25A  !
3A	left London."	209:177,26A  !
3B	"Perfectly so ~ I thank you."	209:177,27B  !
3A	"I think I have understood that Mr% Bingley has not	209:177,30A  !
3A	much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"	209:177,31A  !
3B	"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable	209:177,32B  !
3B	that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	209:177,33B  !
3B	He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when	209:178, 1B  !
3B	friends and engagements are continually increasing."	209:178, 2B  !
3A	"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would	209:178, 3A  !
3A	be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up	209:178, 4A  !
3A	the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a	209:178, 5A  !
3A	settled family there.  But perhaps Mr% Bingley did not	209:178, 6A  !
3A	take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood	209:178, 7A  !
3A	as for his own, and we must expect him to keep	209:178, 8A  !
3A	or quit it on the same principle."	209:178, 9A  !
3B	"I should not be surprised,"	209:178,10B  !
3B	"if he were	209:178,10B  !
3B	to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."	209:178,11B  !
3B	"This seems	209:178,16B  !
3B	a very comfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe,	209:178,17B  !
3B	did a great deal to it when Mr% Collins first came to	209:178,18B  !
3B	Hunsford."	209:178,19B  !
3A	"I believe she did ~ and I am sure she could not have	209:178,20A  !
3A	bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."	209:178,21A  !
3B	"Mr% Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of	209:178,22B  !
3B	a wife."	209:178,23B  !
3A	"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his	209:178,24A  !
3A	having met with one of the very few sensible women	209:178,25A  !
3A	who would have accepted him, or have made him happy	209:178,26A  !
3A	if they had.  My friend has an excellent understanding ~	209:178,27A  !
3A	though I am not certain that I consider her marrying	209:178,28A  !
3A	Mr% Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.  She seems	209:178,29A  !
3A	perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is	209:178,30A  !
3A	certainly a very good match for her."	209:178,31A  !
3B	"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within	209:178,32B  !
3B	so easy a distance of her own family and friends."	209:178,33B  !
3A	"An easy distance do you call it?  It is nearly fifty	209:178,34A  !
3A	miles."	209:178,35A  !
3B	"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more	209:178,36B  !
3B	than half a day's journey.  Yes, I call it a \very\ easy	209:178,37B  !
3B	distance."	209:178,38B  !
3A	"I should never have considered the distance as one	209:179, 1A  !
3A	of the \advantages\ of the match,"	209:179, 2A  !
3A	"I	209:179, 2A  !
3A	should never have said Mrs% Collins was settled \near\ her	209:179, 3A  !
3A	family."	209:179, 4A  !
3B	"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.	209:179, 5B  !
3B	Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of	209:179, 6B  !
3B	Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."	209:179, 7B  !
3A	"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be	209:179,12A  !
3A	settled too near her family.  The far and the near must	209:179,13A  !
3A	be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	209:179,14A  !
3A	Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling	209:179,15A  !
3A	unimportant, distance becomes no evil.  But that is not	209:179,16A  !
3A	the case \here\.  Mr% and Mrs% Collins have a comfortable	209:179,17A  !
3A	income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent	209:179,18A  !
3A	journeys ~ and I am persuaded my friend would not call	209:179,19A  !
3A	herself \near\ her family under less than \half\ the present	209:179,20A  !
3A	distance."	209:179,21A  !
3B	"\You\ cannot have a right to such very strong	209:179,23B  !
3B	local attachment.  \You\ cannot have been always at	209:179,24B  !
3B	Longbourn."	209:179,25B  !
3B	"Are you pleased with Kent?"	209:179,30B  !
3A	"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."	210:182,33A  !
3A	"No, I should have turned in a moment."	210:183, 4A  !
3A	"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"	210:183, 7A  !
3A	"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement,	210:183,11A  !
3A	he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.  I do	210:183,12A  !
3A	not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power	210:183,13A  !
3A	of doing what he likes than Mr% Darcy."	210:183,14A  !
3A	"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know	210:183,21A  !
3A	very little of either.  Now, seriously, what have you ever	210:183,22A  !
3A	known of self-denial and dependence?  When have you	210:183,23A  !
3A	been prevented by want of money from going wherever	210:183,24A  !
3A	you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	210:183,25A  !
3A	"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think	210:183,31A  !
3A	they very often do."	210:183,32A  !
3A	"And pray, what is the usual price of an	210:183,38A  !
3A	Earl's younger son?  Unless the elder brother is very	210:184, 1A  !
3A	sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand	210:184, 2A  !
3A	pounds."	210:184, 3A  !
3A	"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him	210:184, 8A  !
3A	chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.	210:184, 9A  !
3A	I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience	210:184,10A  !
3A	of that kind.  But, perhaps his sister does as	210:184,11A  !
3A	well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care,	210:184,12A  !
3A	he may do what he likes with her."	210:184,13A  !
3A	"Are you, indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians	210:184,17A  !
3A	do you make?  Does your charge give you much trouble?	210:184,18A  !
3A	Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult	210:184,19A  !
3A	to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may	210:184,20A  !
3A	like to have her own way."	210:184,21A  !
3A	"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm	210:184,27A  !
3A	of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable	210:184,28A  !
3A	creatures in the world.  She is a very great favourite with	210:184,29A  !
3A	some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs% Hurst and Miss Bingley.	210:184,30A  !
3A	I think I have heard you say that you know	210:184,31A  !
3A	them."	210:184,32A  !
3A	"Oh| yes,"	210:184,35A  !
3A	"Mr% Darcy is	210:184,35A  !
3A	uncommonly kind to Mr% Bingley, and takes a prodigious	210:184,36A  !
3A	deal of care of him."	210:184,37A  !
3A	"What is it you mean?"	210:185, 7A  !
3A	"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."	210:185,12A  !
3A	"Did Mr% Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	210:185,22A  !
3A	"And what arts did he use to separate them?"	210:185,26A  !
3A	"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,"	210:185,33A  !
3A	"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my	210:185,34A  !
3A	feelings.  Why was he to be the judge?"	210:185,35A  !
3A	"I do not see what right Mr% Darcy had to decide on	210:185,38A  !
3A	the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his	210:186, 1A  !
3A	own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in	210:186, 2A  !
3A	what manner that friend was to be happy."  "But,"	210:186, 3A  !
3A	"as we know none of the	210:186, 4A  !
3A	particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.  It is not to	210:186, 5A  !
3A	be supposed that there was much affection in the case."	210:186, 6A  !
3A	"To Jane herself,"	210:186,35A  !
3A	"there could be no	210:186,35A  !
3A	possibility of objection.  All loveliness and goodness as	210:186,36A  !
3A	she is|  Her understanding excellent, her mind improved,	210:186,37A  !
3A	and her manners captivating.  Neither could any thing	210:186,38A  !
3A	be urged against my father, who, though with some	210:187, 1A  !
3A	peculiarities, has abilities which Mr% Darcy himself need	210:187, 2A  !
3A	not disdain, and respectability which he will probably	210:187, 3A  !
3A	never reach."	210:187, 4A  !
3B	"In vain have I struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings	211:189, 9B  !
3B	will not be repressed.  You must allow me to tell you	211:189,10B  !
3B	how ardently I admire and love you."	211:189,11B  !
3A	"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established	211:190, 3A  !
3A	mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments	211:190, 4A  !
3A	avowed, however unequally they may be returned.  It is	211:190, 5A  !
3A	natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could \feel\	211:190, 6A  !
3A	gratitude, I would now thank you.  But I cannot ~ I have	211:190, 7A  !
3A	never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly	211:190, 8A  !
3A	bestowed it most unwillingly.  I am sorry to have occasioned	211:190, 9A  !
3A	pain to any one.  It has been most unconsciously	211:190,10A  !
3A	done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.	211:190,11A  !
3A	The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the	211:190,12A  !
3A	acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty	211:190,13A  !
3A	in overcoming it after this explanation."	211:190,14A  !
3B	"And this is all the reply which I am to have the	211:190,24B  !
3B	honour of expecting|  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed	211:190,25B  !
3B	why, with so little \endeavour\ at civility, I am thus	211:190,26B  !
3B	rejected.  But it is of small importance."	211:190,27B  !
3A	"I might as well enquire,"	211:190,28A  !
3A	"why with so	211:190,28A  !
3A	evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose	211:190,29A  !
3A	to tell me that you liked me against your will, against	211:190,30A  !
3A	your reason, and even against your character?  Was not	211:190,31A  !
3A	this some excuse for incivility, if I \was\ uncivil?  But I have	211:190,32A  !
3A	other provocations.  You know I have.  Had not my own	211:190,33A  !
3A	feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent,	211:190,34A  !
3A	or had they even been favourable, do you think that any	211:190,35A  !
3A	consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has	211:190,36A  !
3A	been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness	211:190,37A  !
3A	of a most beloved sister?"	211:190,38A  !
3A	"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	211:191, 4A  !
3A	No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part	211:191, 5A  !
3A	you acted \there\.  You dare not, you cannot deny that you	211:191, 6A  !
3A	have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing	211:191, 7A  !
3A	them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of	211:191, 8A  !
3A	the world for caprice and instability, the other to its	211:191, 9A  !
3A	derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both	211:191,10A  !
3A	in misery of the acutest kind."	211:191,11A  !
3A	"Can you deny that you have done it?"	211:191,16A  !
3B	"I have no wish	211:191,17B  !
3B	of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate	211:191,18B  !
3B	my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	211:191,19B  !
3B	Towards \him\ I have been kinder than towards myself."	211:191,20B  !
3A	"But it is not merely this affair,"	211:191,24A  !
3A	"on	211:191,24A  !
3A	which my dislike is founded.  Long before it had taken	211:191,25A  !
3A	place, my opinion of you was decided.  Your character	211:191,26A  !
3A	was unfolded in the recital which I received many months	211:191,27A  !
3A	ago from Mr% Wickham.  On this subject, what can you	211:191,28A  !
3A	have to say?  In what imaginary act of friendship can you	211:191,29A  !
3A	here defend yourself?  or under what misrepresentation,	211:191,30A  !
3A	can you here impose upon others?"	211:191,31A  !
3B	"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's	211:191,32B  !
3B	concerns,"	211:191,33B  !
3A	"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can	211:191,35A  !
3A	help feeling an interest in him?"	211:191,36A  !
3B	"His misfortunes|"	211:191,37B  !
3B	"yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."	211:191,38B  !
3A	"And of your infliction,"	211:192, 1A  !
3A	"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty,	211:192, 2A  !
3A	comparative poverty.  You have withheld the advantages,	211:192, 3A  !
3A	which you must know to have been designed for him.	211:192, 4A  !
3A	You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence	211:192, 5A  !
3A	which was no less his due than his desert.  You	211:192, 6A  !
3A	have done all this| and yet you can treat the mention	211:192, 7A  !
3A	of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule."	211:192, 8A  !
3B	"And this,"	211:192, 9B  !
3B	"is your opinion of me|  This is	211:192,10B  !
3B	the estimation in which you hold me|  I thank you	211:192,11B  !
3B	for explaining it so fully.  My faults, according to this	211:192,12B  !
3B	calculation, are heavy indeed|  But perhaps,"	211:192,13B  !
3B	"these	211:192,14B  !
3B	offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride	211:192,15B  !
3B	been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that	211:192,16B  !
3B	had long prevented my forming any serious design.	211:192,17B  !
3B	These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had	211:192,18B  !
3B	I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered	211:192,19B  !
3B	you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified,	211:192,20B  !
3B	unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by	211:192,21B  !
3B	every thing.  But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	211:192,22B  !
3B	Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.  They	211:192,23B  !
3B	were natural and just.  Could you expect me to rejoice	211:192,24B  !
3B	in the inferiority of your connections?  To congratulate	211:192,25B  !
3B	myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life	211:192,26B  !
3B	is so decidedly beneath my own?"	211:192,27B  !
3A	"You are mistaken, Mr% Darcy, if you suppose that	211:192,31A  !
3A	the mode of your declaration affected me in any other	211:192,32A  !
3A	way, than as it spared me the concern which I might	211:192,33A  !
3A	have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more	211:192,34A  !
3A	gentleman-like manner."	211:192,35A  !
3A	"You could not have made me the offer of your hand	211:192,38A  !
3A	in any possible way that would have tempted me to	211:193, 1A  !
3A	accept it."	211:193, 2A  !
3A	"From the very beginning, from the first moment	211:193, 6A  !
3A	I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your	211:193, 7A  !
3A	manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your	211:193, 8A  !
3A	arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the	211:193, 9A  !
3A	feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work	211:193,10A  !
3A	of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built	211:193,11A  !
3A	so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a	211:193,12A  !
3A	month before I felt that you were the last man in the	211:193,13A  !
3A	world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."	211:193,14A  !
3B	"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly	211:193,15B  !
3B	comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be	211:193,16B  !
3B	ashamed of what my own have been.  Forgive me for	211:193,17B  !
3B	having taken up so much of your time, and accept my	211:193,18B  !
3B	best wishes for your health and happiness."	211:193,19B  !
3B	"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope	212:195,30B  !
3B	of meeting you.  Will you do me the honour of reading	212:195,31B  !
3B	that letter?" ~	212:195,32B  !
3B	"Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by	212:196, 9B  !
3B	the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those	212:196,10B  !
3B	sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last	212:196,11B  !
3B	night so disgusting to you.  I write without any intention	212:196,12B  !
3B	of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on	212:196,13B  !
3B	wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too	212:196,14B  !
3B	soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and	212:196,15B  !
3B	the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been	212:196,16B  !
3B	spared, had not my character required it to be written	212:196,17B  !
3B	and read.  You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with	212:196,18B  !
3B	which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know,	212:196,19B  !
3B	will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.	212:196,20B  !
3B	"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no	212:196,21B  !
3B	means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my	212:196,22B  !
3B	charge.  The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the	212:196,23B  !
3B	sentiments of either, I had detached Mr% Bingley from	212:196,24B  !
3B	your sister, ~ and the other, that I had, in defiance of	212:196,25B  !
3B	various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined	212:196,26B  !
3B	the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of	212:196,27B  !
3B	Mr% Wickham. ~ Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off	212:196,28B  !
3B	the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite	212:196,29B  !
3B	of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other	212:196,30B  !
3B	dependence than on our patronage, and who had been	212:196,31B  !
3B	brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,	212:196,32B  !
3B	to which the separation of two young persons, whose	212:196,33B  !
3B	affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could	212:196,34B  !
3B	bear no comparison. ~ But from the severity of that blame	212:196,35B  !
3B	which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each	212:196,36B  !
3B	circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when	212:196,37B  !
3B	the following account of my actions and their motives	212:196,38B  !
3B	has been read. ~ If, in the explanation of them which is	212:197, 1B  !
3B	due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings	212:197, 2B  !
3B	which may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am	212:197, 3B  !
3B	sorry. ~ The necessity must be obeyed ~ and farther apology	212:197, 4B  !
3B	would be absurd. ~ I had not been long in Hertfordshire,	212:197, 5B  !
3B	before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred	212:197, 6B  !
3B	your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the	212:197, 7B  !
3B	country. ~ But it was not till the evening of the dance at	212:197, 8B  !
3B	Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling	212:197, 9B  !
3B	a serious attachment. ~ I had often seen him in love before.	212:197,10B  !
3B	~ At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with	212:197,11B  !
3B	you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's	212:197,12B  !
3B	accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your	212:197,13B  !
3B	sister had given rise to a general expectation of their	212:197,14B  !
3B	marriage.  He spoke of it as a certain event, of which	212:197,15B  !
3B	the time alone could be undecided.  From that moment	212:197,16B  !
3B	I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could	212:197,17B  !
3B	then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was	212:197,18B  !
3B	beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.  Your sister	212:197,19B  !
3B	I also watched. ~ Her look and manners were open,	212:197,20B  !
3B	cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom	212:197,21B  !
3B	of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the	212:197,22B  !
3B	evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions	212:197,23B  !
3B	with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation	212:197,24B  !
3B	of sentiment. ~ If \you\ have not been mistaken here, \I\ must	212:197,25B  !
3B	have been in an error.  Your superior knowledge of your	212:197,26B  !
3B	sister must make the latter probable. ~ If it be so, if I have	212:197,27B  !
3B	been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your	212:197,28B  !
3B	resentment has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not	212:197,29B  !
3B	scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance	212:197,30B  !
3B	and air was such, as might have given the most	212:197,31B  !
3B	acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her	212:197,32B  !
3B	temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. ~	212:197,33B  !
3B	That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain, ~	212:197,34B  !
3B	but I will venture to say that my investigations and	212:197,35B  !
3B	decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.	212:197,36B  !
3B	~ I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; ~	212:197,37B  !
3B	I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished	212:197,38B  !
3B	it in reason. ~ My objections to the marriage were not	212:198, 1B  !
3B	merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have	212:198, 2B  !
3B	required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my	212:198, 3B  !
3B	own case; the want of connection could not be so great	212:198, 4B  !
3B	an evil to my friend as to me. ~ But there were other	212:198, 5B  !
3B	causes of repugnance; ~ causes which, though still existing,	212:198, 6B  !
3B	and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had	212:198, 7B  !
3B	myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not	212:198, 8B  !
3B	immediately before me. ~ These causes must be stated,	212:198, 9B  !
3B	though briefly. ~ The situation of your mother's family,	212:198,10B  !
3B	though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that	212:198,11B  !
3B	total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly	212:198,12B  !
3B	betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and	212:198,13B  !
3B	occasionally even by your father. ~ Pardon me. ~ It pains	212:198,14B  !
3B	me to offend you.  But amidst your concern for the	212:198,15B  !
3B	defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at	212:198,16B  !
3B	this representation of them, let it give you consolation	212:198,17B  !
3B	to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to	212:198,18B  !
3B	avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less	212:198,19B  !
3B	generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it	212:198,20B  !
3B	is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. ~ I will	212:198,21B  !
3B	only say farther, that from what passed that evening,	212:198,22B  !
3B	my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement	212:198,23B  !
3B	heightened, which could have led me before, to	212:198,24B  !
3B	preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy	212:198,25B  !
3B	connection. ~ He left Netherfield for London, on the day	212:198,26B  !
3B	following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design	212:198,27B  !
3B	of soon returning. ~ The part which I acted, is now to be	212:198,28B  !
3B	explained.  ~ His sisters' uneasiness had been equally	212:198,29B  !
3B	excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon	212:198,30B  !
3B	discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be	212:198,31B  !
3B	lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on	212:198,32B  !
3B	joining him directly in London. ~ We accordingly went ~	212:198,33B  !
3B	and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out	212:198,34B  !
3B	to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice. ~ I described,	212:198,35B  !
3B	and enforced them earnestly. ~ But, however this	212:198,36B  !
3B	remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination,	212:198,37B  !
3B	I do not suppose that it would ultimately have	212:198,38B  !
3B	prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the	212:199, 1B  !
3B	assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's	212:199, 2B  !
3B	indifference.  He had before believed her to return his	212:199, 3B  !
3B	affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.  ~ But	212:199, 4B  !
3B	Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence	212:199, 5B  !
3B	on my judgment than on his own. ~ To convince	212:199, 6B  !
3B	him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very	212:199, 7B  !
3B	difficult point.  To persuade him against returning into	212:199, 8B  !
3B	Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was	212:199, 9B  !
3B	scarcely the work of a moment. ~ I cannot blame myself	212:199,10B  !
3B	for having done thus much.  There is but one part of my	212:199,11B  !
3B	conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect	212:199,12B  !
3B	with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the	212:199,13B  !
3B	measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's	212:199,14B  !
3B	being in town.  I knew it myself, as it was known to	212:199,15B  !
3B	Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. ~	212:199,16B  !
3B	That they might have met without ill consequence, is	212:199,17B  !
3B	perhaps probable; ~ but his regard did not appear to me	212:199,18B  !
3B	enough extinguished for him to see her without some	212:199,19B  !
3B	danger. ~ Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was	212:199,20B  !
3B	beneath me. ~ It is done, however, and it was done for	212:199,21B  !
3B	the best. ~ On this subject I have nothing more to say,	212:199,22B  !
3B	no other apology to offer.  If I have wounded your sister's	212:199,23B  !
3B	feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the	212:199,24B  !
3B	motives which governed me may to you very naturally	212:199,25B  !
3B	appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn	212:199,26B  !
3B	them. ~ With respect to that other, more weighty accusation,	212:199,27B  !
3B	of having injured Mr% Wickham, I can only refute	212:199,28B  !
3B	it by laying before you the whole of his connection with	212:199,29B  !
3B	my family.  Of what he has \particularly\ accused me I am	212:199,30B  !
3B	ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can	212:199,31B  !
3B	summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.	212:199,32B  !
3B	Mr% Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who	212:199,33B  !
3B	had for many years the management of all the Pemberley	212:199,34B  !
3B	estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his	212:199,35B  !
3B	trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to	212:199,36B  !
3B	him, and on George Wickham, who was his god-son, his	212:199,37B  !
3B	kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.  My father	212:199,38B  !
3B	supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; ~	212:200, 1B  !
3B	most important assistance, as his own father, always poor	212:200, 2B  !
3B	from the extravagance of his wife, would have been	212:200, 3B  !
3B	unable to give him a gentleman's education.  My father	212:200, 4B  !
3B	was not only fond of this young man's society, whose	212:200, 5B  !
3B	manners were always engaging; he had also the highest	212:200, 6B  !
3B	opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his	212:200, 7B  !
3B	profession, intended to provide for him in it.  As for	212:200, 8B  !
3B	myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think	212:200, 9B  !
3B	of him in a very different manner.  The vicious propensities ~	212:200,10B  !
3B	the want of principle which he was careful to	212:200,11B  !
3B	guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not	212:200,12B  !
3B	escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same	212:200,13B  !
3B	age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing	212:200,14B  !
3B	him in unguarded moments, which Mr% Darcy could not	212:200,15B  !
3B	have.  Here again I shall give you pain ~ to what degree	212:200,16B  !
3B	you only can tell.  But whatever may be the sentiments	212:200,17B  !
3B	which Mr% Wickham has created, a suspicion of their	212:200,18B  !
3B	nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real	212:200,19B  !
3B	character.  It adds even another motive.  My excellent	212:200,20B  !
3B	father died about five years ago; and his attachment to	212:200,21B  !
3B	Mr% Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will	212:200,22B  !
3B	he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his	212:200,23B  !
3B	advancement in the best manner that his profession might	212:200,24B  !
3B	allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family	212:200,25B  !
3B	living might be his as soon as it became vacant.  There	212:200,26B  !
3B	was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.  His own father	212:200,27B  !
3B	did not long survive mine, and within half a year from	212:200,28B  !
3B	these events, Mr% Wickham wrote to inform me that,	212:200,29B  !
3B	having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped	212:200,30B  !
3B	I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect	212:200,31B  !
3B	some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the	212:200,32B  !
3B	preferment, by which he could not be benefited.  He had	212:200,33B  !
3B	some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must	212:200,34B  !
3B	be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would	212:200,35B  !
3B	be a very insufficient support therein.  I rather wished,	212:200,36B  !
3B	than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was	212:200,37B  !
3B	perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.  I knew that	212:200,38B  !
3B	Mr% Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.  The business	212:201, 1B  !
3B	was therefore soon settled.  He resigned all claim to	212:201, 2B  !
3B	assistance in the church, were it possible that he could	212:201, 3B  !
3B	ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return	212:201, 4B  !
3B	three thousand pounds.  All connection between us	212:201, 5B  !
3B	seemed now dissolved.  I thought too ill of him, to invite	212:201, 6B  !
3B	him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.  In town	212:201, 7B  !
3B	I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was	212:201, 8B  !
3B	a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint,	212:201, 9B  !
3B	his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.  For about	212:201,10B  !
3B	three years I heard little of him; but on the decease	212:201,11B  !
3B	of the incumbent of the living which had been designed	212:201,12B  !
3B	for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.	212:201,13B  !
3B	His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no	212:201,14B  !
3B	difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had	212:201,15B  !
3B	found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now	212:201,16B  !
3B	absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present	212:201,17B  !
3B	him to the living in question ~ of which he trusted there	212:201,18B  !
3B	could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had	212:201,19B  !
3B	no other person to provide for, and I could not have	212:201,20B  !
3B	forgotten my revered father's intentions.  You will hardly	212:201,21B  !
3B	blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or	212:201,22B  !
3B	for resisting every repetition of it.  His resentment was	212:201,23B  !
3B	in proportion to the distress of his circumstances ~ and	212:201,24B  !
3B	he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others,	212:201,25B  !
3B	as in his reproaches to myself.  After this period, every	212:201,26B  !
3B	appearance of acquaintance was dropt.  How he lived	212:201,27B  !
3B	I know not.  But last summer he was again most painfully	212:201,28B  !
3B	obtruded on my notice.  I must now mention a circumstance	212:201,29B  !
3B	which I would wish to forget myself, and which	212:201,30B  !
3B	no obligation less than the present should induce me to	212:201,31B  !
3B	unfold to any human being.  Having said thus much,	212:201,32B  !
3B	I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My sister, who is more	212:201,33B  !
3B	than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of	212:201,34B  !
3B	my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.	212:201,35B  !
3B	About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an	212:201,36B  !
3B	establishment formed for her in London; and last summer	212:201,37B  !
3B	she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;	212:201,38B  !
3B	and thither also went Mr% Wickham, undoubtedly by	212:202, 1B  !
3B	design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance	212:202, 2B  !
3B	between him and Mrs% Younge, in whose character we	212:202, 3B  !
3B	were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance	212:202, 4B  !
3B	and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,	212:202, 5B  !
3B	whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of	212:202, 6B  !
3B	his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to	212:202, 7B  !
3B	believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	212:202, 8B  !
3B	She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and	212:202, 9B  !
3B	after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that	212:202,10B  !
3B	I owed the knowledge of it to herself.  I joined them	212:202,11B  !
3B	unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement,	212:202,12B  !
3B	and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving	212:202,13B  !
3B	and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to	212:202,14B  !
3B	as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.  You may	212:202,15B  !
3B	imagine what I felt and how I acted.  Regard for my	212:202,16B  !
3B	sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure,	212:202,17B  !
3B	but I wrote to Mr% Wickham, who left the place immediately,	212:202,18B  !
3B	and Mrs% Younge was of course removed from her	212:202,19B  !
3B	charge.  Mr% Wickham's chief object was unquestionably	212:202,20B  !
3B	my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds;	212:202,21B  !
3B	but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging	212:202,22B  !
3B	himself on me, was a strong inducement.  His revenge	212:202,23B  !
3B	would have been complete indeed.  This, madam, is a	212:202,24B  !
3B	faithful narrative of every event in which we have been	212:202,25B  !
3B	concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject	212:202,26B  !
3B	it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty	212:202,27B  !
3B	towards Mr% Wickham.  I know not in what manner, under	212:202,28B  !
3B	what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his	212:202,29B  !
3B	success is not perhaps to be wondered at.  Ignorant as you	212:202,30B  !
3B	previously were of every thing concerning either, detection	212:202,31B  !
3B	could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly	212:202,32B  !
3B	not in your inclination.  You may possibly wonder why	212:202,33B  !
3B	all this was not told you last night.  But I was not then	212:202,34B  !
3B	master enough of myself to know what could or ought	212:202,35B  !
3B	to be revealed.  For the truth of every thing here related,	212:202,36B  !
3B	I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam,	212:202,37B  !
3B	who from our near relationship and constant	212:202,38B  !
3B	intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my	212:203, 1B  !
3B	father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every	212:203, 2B  !
3B	particular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of	212:203, 3B  !
3B	\me\ should make \my\ assertions valueless, you cannot be	212:203, 4B  !
3B	prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin;	212:203, 5B  !
3B	and that there may be the possibility of consulting him,	212:203, 6B  !
3B	I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this	212:203, 7B  !
3B	letter in your hands in the course of the morning.  I will	212:203, 8B  !
3B	only add, God bless you.	212:203, 9B  !
3B	"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."	212:203,10B  !
3A	"This must be false|	213:204,31A  !
3A	This cannot be|  This must be the grossest falsehood|" ~	213:204,32A  !
3A	"How despicably have I acted|"	213:208,11A  !
3A	"I, who	213:208,11A  !
3A	have prided myself on my discernment| ~ I, who have	213:208,12A  !
3A	valued myself on my abilities| who have often disdained	213:208,13A  !
3A	the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity,	213:208,14A  !
3A	in useless or blameable distrust. ~ How humiliating is this	213:208,15A  !
3A	discovery| ~ Yet, how just a humiliation| ~ Had I been	213:208,16A  !
3A	in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.	213:208,17A  !
3A	But vanity, not love, has been my folly. ~ Pleased with	213:208,18A  !
3A	the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the	213:208,19A  !
3A	other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have	213:208,20A  !
3A	courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason	213:208,21A  !
3A	away, where either were concerned.  Till this moment,	213:208,22A  !
3A	I never knew myself."	213:208,23A  !
3L	"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,"	214:210,21L  !
3L	"I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so	214:210,22L  !
3L	much as I do.  But I am particularly attached to these	214:210,23L  !
3L	young men; and know them to be so much attached to	214:210,24L  !
3L	me| ~ They were excessively sorry to go|  But so they	214:210,25L  !
3L	always are.  The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably	214:210,26L  !
3L	till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,	214:210,27L  !
3L	more I think than last year.  His attachment to Rosings,	214:210,28L  !
3L	certainly increases."	214:210,29L  !
3L	"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother	214:211, 5L  !
3L	to beg that you may stay a little longer.  Mrs% Collins	214:211, 6L  !
3L	will be very glad of your company, I am sure."	214:211, 7L  !
3A	"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind	214:211, 8A  !
3A	invitation,"	214:211, 9A  !
3A	"but it is not in my power	214:211, 9A  !
3A	to accept it. ~ I must be in town next Saturday."	214:211,10A  !
3L	"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six	214:211,11L  !
3L	weeks.  I expected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs% Collins	214:211,12L  !
3L	so before you came.  There can be no occasion	214:211,13L  !
3L	for your going so soon.  Mrs% Bennet could certainly spare	214:211,14L  !
3L	you for another fortnight."	214:211,15L  !
3A	"But my father cannot. ~ He wrote last week to hurry	214:211,16A  !
3A	my return."	214:211,17A  !
3L	"Oh| your father of course may spare you, if your	214:211,18L  !
3L	mother can. ~ Daughters are never of so much consequence	214:211,19L  !
3L	to a father.  And if you will stay another \month\ complete,	214:211,20L  !
3L	it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London,	214:211,21L  !
3L	for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as	214:211,22L  !
3L	Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there	214:211,23L  !
3L	will be very good room for one of you ~ and indeed,	214:211,24L  !
3L	if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not	214:211,25L  !
3L	object to taking you both, as you are neither of you	214:211,26L  !
3L	large."	214:211,27L  !
3A	"You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must	214:211,28A  !
3A	abide by our original plan."	214:211,29A  !
3L	"Mrs% Collins, you must send a servant with them.	214:211,31L  !
3L	You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the	214:211,32L  !
3L	idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	214:211,33L  !
3L	It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send somebody.	214:211,34L  !
3L	I have the greatest dislike in the world to that	214:211,35L  !
3L	sort of thing. ~ Young women should always be properly	214:211,36L  !
3L	guarded and attended, according to their situation in	214:211,37L  !
3L	life.  When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last	214:211,38L  !
3L	summer, I made a point of her having two men servants	214:212, 1L  !
3L	go with her. ~ Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr% Darcy,	214:212, 2L  !
3L	of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared	214:212, 3L  !
3L	with propriety in a different manner. ~ I am excessively	214:212, 4L  !
3L	attentive to all those things.  You must send John with	214:212, 5L  !
3L	the young ladies, Mrs% Collins.  I am glad it occurred to	214:212, 6L  !
3L	me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to	214:212, 7L  !
3L	\you\ to let them go alone."	214:212, 8L  !
3A	"My uncle is to send a servant for us."	214:212, 9A  !
3L	"Oh| ~ Your uncle| ~ He keeps a man-servant, does	214:212,10L  !
3L	he? ~ I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of	214:212,11L  !
3L	those things.  Where shall you change horses? ~ Oh|	214:212,12L  !
3L	Bromley, of course. ~ If you mention my name at the Bell,	214:212,13L  !
3L	you will be attended to."	214:212,14L  !
3K	"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,"	215:215, 5K  !
3K	"whether	215:215, 5K  !
3K	Mrs% Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness	215:215, 6K  !
3K	in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave	215:215, 7K  !
3K	the house without receiving her thanks for it.  The favour	215:215, 8K  !
3K	of your company has been much felt, I assure you.  We	215:215, 9K  !
3K	know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble	215:215,10K  !
3K	abode.  Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and	215:215,11K  !
3K	few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must	215:215,12K  !
3K	make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself;	215:215,13K  !
3K	but I hope you will believe us grateful for the	215:215,14K  !
3K	condescension, and that we have done every thing in our	215:215,15K  !
3K	power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."	215:215,16K  !
3K	"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you	215:215,23K  !
3K	have passed your time not disagreeably.  We have	215:215,24K  !
3K	certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it	215:215,25K  !
3K	in our power to introduce you to very superior society,	215:215,26K  !
3K	and from our connections with Rosings, the frequent means	215:215,27K  !
3K	of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter	215:215,28K  !
3K	ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been	215:215,29K  !
3K	entirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's	215:215,30K  !
3K	family is indeed the sort of extraordinary	215:215,31K  !
3K	advantage and blessing which few can boast.  You see	215:216, 1K  !
3K	on what a footing we are.  You see how continually we are	215:216, 2K  !
3K	engaged there.  In truth I must acknowledge that, with	215:216, 3K  !
3K	all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should	215:216, 4K  !
3K	not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion,	215:216, 5K  !
3K	while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."	215:216, 6K  !
3K	"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of	215:216,11K  !
3K	us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself	215:216,12K  !
3K	at least that you will be able to do so.  Lady Catherine's	215:216,13K  !
3K	great attentions to Mrs% Collins you have been a daily	215:216,14K  !
3K	witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear	215:216,15K  !
3K	that your friend has drawn an unfortunate ~ but on this	215:216,16K  !
3K	point it will be as well to be silent.  Only let me assure	215:216,17K  !
3K	you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart	215:216,18K  !
3K	most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.  My	215:216,19K  !
3K	dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of	215:216,20K  !
3K	thinking.  There is in every thing a most remarkable	215:216,21K  !
3K	resemblance of character and ideas between us.  We seem	215:216,22K  !
3K	to have been designed for each other."	215:216,23K  !
3K	"But,"	215:217,11K  !
3K	"you will of course wish to have	215:217,11K  !
3K	your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful	215:217,12K  !
3K	thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."	215:217,13K  !
3A	"A great many indeed,"	215:217,19A  !
3A	"And how much I shall	215:217,23A  !
3A	have to conceal."	215:217,24A  !
3H	"And we mean to treat you all,"	216:219,15H  !
3H	"but	216:219,15H  !
3H	you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours	216:219,16H  !
3H	at the shop out there."	216:219,17H  !
3H	"Look here, I have bought this bonnet.  I do not think	216:219,18H  !
3H	it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it	216:219,19H  !
3H	as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home,	216:219,20H  !
3H	and see if I can make it up any better."	216:219,21H  !
3H	"Oh| but there were two or	216:219,23H  !
3H	three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought	216:219,24H  !
3H	some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think	216:219,25H  !
3H	it will be very tolerable.  Besides, it will not much signify	216:219,26H  !
3H	what one wears this summer, after the @@@@ shire have	216:219,27H  !
3H	left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."	216:219,28H  !
3A	"Are they indeed?"	216:219,29A  !
3H	"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and	216:219,31H  !
3H	I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer|	216:219,32H  !
3H	It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say	216:219,33H  !
3H	would hardly cost any thing at all.  Mamma would like	216:220, 1H  !
3H	to go too of all things|  Only think what a miserable	216:220, 2H  !
3H	summer else we shall have|"	216:220, 3H  !
3H	"Now I have got some news for you,"	216:220, 9H  !
3H	"What do you think?  It is	216:220,10H  !
3H	excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person	216:220,11H  !
3H	that we all like."	216:220,12H  !
3H	"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	216:220,16H  !
3H	You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared|	216:220,17H  !
3H	I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am	216:220,18H  !
3H	going to say.  But he is an ugly fellow|  I am glad he is	216:220,19H  !
3H	gone.  I never saw such a long chin in my life.  Well, but	216:220,20H  !
3H	now for my news:  it is about dear Wickham; too good	216:220,21H  !
3H	for the waiter, is not it?  There is no danger of Wickham's	216:220,22H  !
3H	marrying Mary King.  There's for you|  She is gone down	216:220,23H  !
3H	to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.  Wickham is	216:220,24H  !
3H	safe."	216:220,25H  !
3A	"And Mary King is safe|"	216:220,26A  !
3A	"safe	216:220,26A  !
3A	from a connection imprudent as to fortune."	216:220,27A  !
3H	"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	216:220,28H  !
3E	"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either	216:220,29E  !
3E	side,"	216:220,30E  !
3H	"I am sure there is not on \his\.  I will answer for it	216:220,31H  !
3H	he never cared three straws about her.  Who \could\ about	216:220,32H  !
3H	such a nasty little freckled thing?"	216:220,33H  !
3H	"How nicely we are crammed in|"	216:221, 5H  !
3H	"I am	216:221, 5H  !
3H	glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having	216:221, 6H  !
3H	another bandbox|  Well, now let us be quite comfortable	216:221, 7H  !
3H	and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.  And	216:221, 8H  !
3H	in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you	216:221, 9H  !
3H	all, since you went away.  Have you seen any pleasant	216:221,10H  !
3H	men?  Have you had any flirting?  I was in great hopes	216:221,11H  !
3H	that one of you would have got a husband before you came	216:221,12H  !
3H	back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	216:221,13H  !
3H	She is almost three and twenty|  Lord, how ashamed	216:221,14H  !
3H	I should be of not being married before three and twenty|	216:221,15H  !
3H	My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't	216:221,16H  !
3H	think.  She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr% Collins;	216:221,17H  !
3H	but \I\ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	216:221,18H  !
3H	Lord| how I should like to be married before any of you;	216:221,19H  !
3H	and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.	216:221,20H  !
3H	Dear me| we had such a good piece of fun the other day	216:221,21H  !
3H	at Colonel Forster's.  Kitty and me were to spend the	216:221,22H  !
3H	day there, and Mrs% Forster promised to have a little	216:221,23H  !
3H	dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs% Forster and	216:221,24H  !
3H	me are \such\ friends|) and so she asked the two Harringtons	216:221,25H  !
3H	to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to	216:221,26H  !
3H	come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	216:221,27H  !
3H	We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on	216:221,28H  !
3H	purpose to pass for a lady, ~ only think what fun|  Not	216:221,29H  !
3H	a soul knew of it, but Col% and Mrs% Forster, and	216:221,30H  !
3H	Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to	216:221,31H  !
3H	borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how	216:221,32H  !
3H	well he looked|  When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt,	216:221,33H  !
3H	and two or three more of the men came in, they did not	216:221,34H  !
3H	know him in the least.  Lord| how I laughed| and so	216:221,35H  !
3H	did Mrs% Forster.  I thought I should have died.  And	216:221,36H  !
3H	\that\ made the men suspect something, and then they soon	216:221,37H  !
3H	found out what was the matter."	216:221,38H  !
3D	"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."	216:222,11D  !
3H	"Oh| Mary,"	216:222,24H  !
3H	"I wish you had gone with	216:222,24H  !
3H	us, for we had such fun| as we went along, Kitty and	216:222,25H  !
3H	me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was	216:222,26H  !
3H	nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the	216:222,27H  !
3H	way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to	216:222,28H  !
3H	the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for	216:222,29H  !
3H	we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon	216:222,30H  !
3H	in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have	216:222,31H  !
3H	treated you too.  And then when we came away it was	216:222,32H  !
3H	such fun|  I thought we never should have got into the	216:222,33H  !
3H	coach.  I was ready to die of laughter.  And then we were	216:222,34H  !
3H	so merry all the way home| we talked and laughed so	216:222,35H  !
3H	loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off|"	216:222,36H  !
3E	"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,"	217:224,15E  !
3E	"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider	217:224,16E  !
3E	how much it must increase his disappointment."	217:224,17E  !
3A	"Indeed,"	217:224,18A  !
3A	"I am heartily sorry for	217:224,18A  !
3A	him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon	217:224,19A  !
3A	drive away his regard for me.  You do not blame me,	217:224,20A  !
3A	however, for refusing him?"	217:224,21A  !
3E	"Blame you|  Oh, no."	217:224,22E  !
3A	"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of	217:224,23A  !
3A	Wickham."	217:224,24A  !
3E	"No ~ I do not know that you were wrong in saying	217:224,25E  !
3E	what you did."	217:224,26E  !
3A	"But you \will\ know it, when I have told you what	217:224,27A  !
3A	happened the very next day."	217:224,28A  !
3A	"This will not do,"	217:225, 6A  !
3A	"You never will	217:225, 6A  !
3A	be able to make both of them good for any thing.  Take	217:225, 7A  !
3A	your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.	217:225, 8A  !
3A	There is but such a quantity of merit between them;	217:225, 9A  !
3A	just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late	217:225,10A  !
3A	it has been shifting about pretty much.  For my part,	217:225,11A  !
3A	I am inclined to believe it all Mr% Darcy's, but you shall	217:225,12A  !
3A	do as you chuse."	217:225,13A  !
3E	"I do not know when I have been more shocked,"	217:225,16E  !
3E	"Wickham so very bad|  It is almost past	217:225,17E  !
3E	belief.  And poor Mr% Darcy| dear Lizzy, only consider	217:225,18E  !
3E	what he must have suffered.  Such a disappointment|	217:225,19E  !
3E	and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too| and having	217:225,20E  !
3E	to relate such a thing of his sister|  It is really too distressing.	217:225,21E  !
3E	I am sure you must feel it so."	217:225,22E  !
3A	"Oh| no, my regret and compassion are all done away	217:225,23A  !
3A	by seeing you so full of both.  I know you will do him	217:225,24A  !
3A	such ample justice, that I am growing every moment	217:225,25A  !
3A	more unconcerned and indifferent.  Your profusion makes	217:225,26A  !
3A	me saving; and if you lament over him much longer,	217:225,27A  !
3A	my heart will be as light as a feather."	217:225,28A  !
3E	"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness	217:225,29E  !
3E	in his countenance| such an openness and gentleness	217:225,30E  !
3E	in his manner."	217:225,31E  !
3A	"There certainly was some great mismanagement in	217:225,32A  !
3A	the education of those two young men.  One has got all	217:225,33A  !
3A	the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."	217:225,34A  !
3E	"I never thought Mr% Darcy so deficient in the \appearance\	217:225,35E  !
3E	of it as you used to do."	217:225,36E  !
3A	"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking	217:225,37A  !
3A	so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.  It is	217:225,38A  !
3A	such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to	217:226, 1A  !
3A	have a dislike of that kind.  One may be continually	217:226, 2A  !
3A	abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot	217:226, 3A  !
3A	be always laughing at a man without now and then	217:226, 4A  !
3A	stumbling on something witty."	217:226, 5A  !
3E	"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you	217:226, 6E  !
3E	could not treat the matter as you do now."	217:226, 7E  !
3A	"Indeed I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough.	217:226, 8A  !
3A	I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.  And with	217:226, 9A  !
3A	no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort	217:226,10A  !
3A	me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain	217:226,11A  !
3A	and nonsensical as I knew I had| Oh| how I wanted you|"	217:226,12A  !
3E	"How unfortunate that you should have used such very	217:226,13E  !
3E	strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr% Darcy,	217:226,14E  !
3E	for now they \do\ appear wholly undeserved."	217:226,15E  !
3A	"Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with	217:226,16A  !
3A	bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices	217:226,17A  !
3A	I had been encouraging.  There is one point, on which	217:226,18A  !
3A	I want your advice.  I want to be told whether I ought,	217:226,19A  !
3A	or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand	217:226,20A  !
3A	Wickham's character."	217:226,21A  !
3E	"Surely	217:226,22E  !
3E	there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	217:226,23E  !
3E	What is your own opinion?"	217:226,24E  !
3A	"That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr% Darcy has	217:226,25A  !
3A	not authorised me to make his communication public.	217:226,26A  !
3A	On the contrary every particular relative to his sister,	217:226,27A  !
3A	was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself;	217:226,28A  !
3A	and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest	217:226,29A  !
3A	of his conduct, who will believe me?  The general prejudice	217:226,30A  !
3A	against Mr% Darcy is so violent, that it would be	217:226,31A  !
3A	the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt	217:226,32A  !
3A	to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.	217:226,33A  !
3A	Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not	217:226,34A  !
3A	signify to anybody here, what he really is.  Sometime	217:226,35A  !
3A	hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh	217:226,36A  !
3A	at their stupidity in not knowing it before.  At present	217:226,37A  !
3A	I will say nothing about it."	217:226,38A  !
3E	"You are quite right.  To have his errors made public	217:227, 1E  !
3E	might ruin him for ever.  He is now perhaps sorry for	217:227, 2E  !
3E	what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.	217:227, 3E  !
3E	We must not make him desperate."	217:227, 4E  !
3A	"And	217:227,16A  !
3A	then,"	217:227,17A  !
3A	"if that very improbable event should	217:227,17A  !
3A	ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley	217:227,18A  !
3A	may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.  The	217:227,19A  !
3A	liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost	217:227,20A  !
3A	all its value|"	217:227,21A  !
3D	"Well, Lizzy,"	217:227,34D  !
3D	"what is	217:227,34D  !
3D	your opinion \now\ of this sad business of Jane's?  For my	217:227,35D  !
3D	part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.	217:227,36D  !
3D	I told my sister Philips so the other day.  But	217:227,37D  !
3D	I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.	217:227,38D  !
3D	Well, he is a very undeserving young man ~ and I do not	217:228, 1D  !
3D	suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever	217:228, 2D  !
3D	getting him now.  There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield	217:228, 3D  !
3D	again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body	217:228, 4D  !
3D	too, who is likely to know."	217:228, 5D  !
3A	"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield	217:228, 6A  !
3A	any more."	217:228, 7A  !
3D	"Oh, well| it is just as he chooses.  Nobody wants	217:228, 8D  !
3D	him to come.  Though I shall always say that he used	217:228, 9D  !
3D	my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would	217:228,10D  !
3D	not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort is, I am sure	217:228,11D  !
3D	Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry	217:228,12D  !
3D	for what he has done."	217:228,13D  !
3D	"Well, Lizzy,"	217:228,16D  !
3D	"and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?	217:228,17D  !
3D	Well, well, I only hope it will last.  And what sort of table	217:228,18D  !
3D	do they keep?  Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare	217:228,19D  !
3D	say.  If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving	217:228,20D  !
3D	enough.  There is nothing extravagant in \their\ housekeeping,	217:228,21D  !
3D	I dare say."	217:228,22D  !
3A	"No, nothing at all."	217:228,23A  !
3D	"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.	217:228,24D  !
3D	Yes, yes.  \They\ will take care not to outrun their income.	217:228,25D  !
3D	\They\ will never be distressed for money.  Well, much good	217:228,26D  !
3D	may it do them|  And so, I suppose, they often talk of	217:228,27D  !
3D	having Longbourn when your father is dead.  They look	217:228,28D  !
3D	upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that	217:228,29D  !
3D	happens.	217:228,30D  !
3A	"It was a subject which they could not mention before	217:228,31A  !
3A	me."	217:228,32A  !
3D	"No.  It would have been strange if they had.  But	217:228,33D  !
3D	I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.	217:228,34D  !
3D	Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully	217:228,35D  !
3D	their own, so much the better.  \I\ should be ashamed of	217:228,36D  !
3D	having one that was only entailed on me."	217:228,37D  !
3D	"I am sure,"	218:229,17D  !
3D	"I cried for two days together	218:229,17D  !
3D	when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.  I thought	218:229,18D  !
3D	I should have broke my heart."	218:229,19D  !

3D	"If one could but go to Brighton|"	218:229,21D  !
3H	"Oh, yes| ~ if one could but go to Brighton|  But papa	218:229,23H  !
3H	is so disagreeable."	218:229,24H  !
3D	"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	218:229,25D  !
3C	"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself	218:230,35C  !
3C	in some public place or other, and we can never expect her	218:230,36C  !
3C	to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her	218:230,37C  !
3C	family as under the present circumstances."	218:230,38C  !
3A	"If you were aware,"	218:231, 1A  !
3A	"of the very great	218:231, 1A  !
3A	disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public	218:231, 2A  !
3A	notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay,	218:231, 3A  !
3A	which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would	218:231, 4A  !
3A	judge differently in the affair."	218:231, 5A  !
3C	"Already arisen|"	218:231, 6C  !
3C	"What, has	218:231, 6C  !
3C	she frightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little	218:231, 7C  !
3C	Lizzy|  But do not be cast down.  Such squeamish youths	218:231, 8C  !
3C	as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,	218:231, 9C  !
3C	are not worth a regret.  Come, let me see the list of the	218:231,10C  !
3C	pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."	218:231,11C  !
3A	"Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries	218:231,12A  !
3A	to resent.  It is not of peculiar, but of general evils,	218:231,13A  !
3A	which I am now complaining.  Our importance, our	218:231,14A  !
3A	respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild	218:231,15A  !
3A	volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which	218:231,16A  !
3A	mark Lydia's character.  Excuse me ~ for I must speak	218:231,17A  !
3A	plainly.  If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble	218:231,18A  !
3A	of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that	218:231,19A  !
3A	her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life,	218:231,20A  !
3A	she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.  Her	218:231,21A  !
3A	character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most	218:231,22A  !
3A	determined flirt that ever made herself and her family	218:231,23A  !
3A	ridiculous.  A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree	218:231,24A  !
3A	of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and	218:231,25A  !
3A	a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness	218:231,26A  !
3A	of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of	218:231,27A  !
3A	that universal contempt which her rage for admiration	218:231,28A  !
3A	will excite.  In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.	218:231,29A  !
3A	She will follow wherever Lydia leads.  Vain, ignorant,	218:231,30A  !
3A	idle, and absolutely uncontrouled|  Oh| my dear father,	218:231,31A  !
3A	can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured	218:231,32A  !
3A	and despised wherever they are known, and that their	218:231,33A  !
3A	sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"	218:231,34A  !
3C	"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.  Wherever	218:231,37C  !
3C	you and Jane are known, you must be respected and	218:231,38C  !
3C	valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for	218:232, 1C  !
3C	having a couple of ~ or I may say, three very silly sisters.	218:232, 2C  !
3C	We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not	218:232, 3C  !
3C	go to Brighton.  Let her go then.  Colonel Forster is	218:232, 4C  !
3C	a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief;	218:232, 5C  !
3C	and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to	218:232, 6C  !
3C	any body.  At Brighton she will be of less importance even	218:232, 7C  !
3C	as a common flirt than she has been here.  The officers	218:232, 8C  !
3C	will find women better worth their notice.  Let us hope,	218:232, 9C  !
3C	therefore, that her being there may teach her her own	218:232,10C  !
3C	insignificance.  At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees	218:232,11C  !
3C	worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest	218:232,12C  !
3C	of her life."	218:232,13C  !
3V	"How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"	218:233,38V  !
3A	"Nearly three weeks."	218:234, 1A  !
3V	"And you saw him frequently?"	218:234, 2V  !
3A	"Yes, almost every day."	218:234, 3A  !
3V	"His manners are very different from his cousin's."	218:234, 4V  !
3A	"Yes, very different.  But I think Mr% Darcy improves	218:234, 5A  !
3A	on acquaintance."	218:234, 6A  !
3V	"Indeed|"	218:234, 7V  !
3V	"And pray may I ask?"	218:234, 8V  !
3V	"Is it in address that he	218:234, 9V  !
3V	improves?  Has he deigned to add ought of civility to	218:234,10V  !
3V	his ordinary style?  for I dare not hope,"	218:234,11V  !
3V	"that he is improved	218:234,12V  !
3V	in essentials."	218:234,13V  !
3A	"Oh, no|"	218:234,14A  !
3A	"In essentials, I believe,	218:234,14A  !
3A	he is very much what he ever was."	218:234,15A  !
3A	"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did	218:234,21A  !
3A	not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state	218:234,22A  !
3A	of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his	218:234,23A  !
3A	disposition was better understood."	218:234,24A  !
3V	"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr% Darcy,	218:234,29V  !
3V	will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that	218:234,30V  !
3V	he is wise enough to assume even the \appearance\ of what	218:234,31V  !
3V	is right.  His pride, in that direction, may be of service,	218:234,32V  !
3V	if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him	218:234,33V  !
3V	from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.  I only	218:234,34V  !
3V	fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine,	218:234,35V  !
3V	have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his	218:234,36V  !
3V	aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands	218:234,37V  !
3V	much in awe.  His fear of her, has always operated,	218:234,38V  !
3V	I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to	218:235, 1V  !
3V	be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with	218:235, 2V  !
3V	Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much	218:235, 3V  !
3V	at heart."	218:235, 4V  !
3A	"But	219:239,20A  !
3A	surely,"	219:239,21A  !
3A	"I may enter his county with impunity,	219:239,21A  !
3A	and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving	219:239,22A  !
3A	me."	219:239,23A  !
3O	"My love, should not you like to see a place of which	219:240,21O  !
3O	you have heard so much?"	219:240,22O  !
3O	"A place too,	219:240,22O  !
3O	with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.	219:240,23O  !
3O	Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."	219:240,24O  !
3O	"If it were merely	219:240,30O  !
3O	a fine house richly furnished,"	219:240,31O  !
3O	"I should not	219:240,31O  !
3O	care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.	219:240,32O  !
3O	They have some of the finest woods in the country."	219:240,33O  !
3O	"I have heard much of your master's fine person,"	301:247,19O  !
3O	"it is a handsome	301:247,20O  !
3O	face.  But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like	301:247,21O  !
3O	or not."	301:247,22O  !
3A	"A little."	301:247,26A  !
3A	"Yes, very handsome."	301:247,29A  !
3A	"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that	301:248,25A  !
3A	you should think so."	301:248,26A  !
3O	"His father was an excellent man,"	301:249,11O  !
3O	"This fine account of him,"	301:249,33O  !
3O	"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our	301:249,34O  !
3O	poor friend."	301:249,35O  !
3A	"Perhaps we might be deceived."	301:249,36A  !
3O	"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."	301:249,37O  !
3A	"He is certainly a good brother,"	301:250, 6A  !
3A	"delightful,"	301:254,30A  !
3A	"charming,"	301:254,30A  !
3A	"for your housekeeper,"	301:256,10A  !
3A	"informed us that you would certainly not be here till	301:256,11A  !
3A	to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood	301:256,12A  !
3A	that you were not immediately expected in the	301:256,13A  !
3A	country."	301:256,14A  !
3B	"They will join me early	301:256,17B  !
3B	to-morrow,"	301:256,18B  !
3B	"and among them are some	301:256,18B  !
3B	who will claim an acquaintance with you, ~ Mr% Bingley	301:256,19B  !
3B	and his sisters."	301:256,20B  !
3B	"There is also one other person in the party,"	301:256,26B  !
3B	"who more particularly wishes to	301:256,27B  !
3B	be known to you, ~ Will you allow me, or do I ask too	301:256,28B  !
3B	much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during	301:256,29B  !
3B	your stay at Lambton?"	301:256,30B  !
3O	"There \is\ something a little stately in him to be sure,"	301:257,26O  !
3O	"but it is confined to his air, and is	301:257,27O  !
3O	not unbecoming.  I can now say with the housekeeper,	301:257,28O  !
3O	that though some people may call him proud, \I\ have seen	301:257,29O  !
3O	nothing of it."	301:257,30O  !
3O	"To be sure, Lizzy,"	301:257,35O  !
3O	"he is not so handsome	301:257,35O  !
3O	as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's	301:257,36O  !
3O	countenance, for his features are perfectly good.  But how	301:257,37O  !
3O	came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"	301:257,38O  !
3O	"From what we have seen of him,"	301:258,12O  !
3O	"I really should not have thought that he could	301:258,13O  !
3O	have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has	301:258,14O  !
3O	done by poor Wickham.  He has not an ill-natured look.	301:258,15O  !
3O	On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his	301:258,16O  !
3O	mouth when he speaks.  And there is something of dignity	301:258,17O  !
3O	in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable	301:258,18O  !
3O	idea of his heart.  But to be sure, the good lady who	301:258,19O  !
3O	shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character|	301:258,20O  !
3O	I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But he	301:258,21O  !
3O	is a liberal master, I suppose, and \that\ in the eye of a servant	301:258,22O  !
3O	comprehends every virtue."	301:258,23O  !
3J	"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the @@@@ shire militia removed	303:269,18J  !
3J	from Meryton?  They must be a great loss to \your\	303:269,19J  !
3J	family."	303:269,20J  !
3J	"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr% Darcy,"	303:270,33J  !
3J	"I never in my life saw any one so	303:270,34J  !
3J	much altered as she is since the winter.  She is grown	303:270,35J  !
3J	so brown and coarse|  Louisa and I were agreeing that	303:270,36J  !
3J	we should not have known her again."	303:270,37J  !
3J	"For my own part,"	303:271, 5J  !
3J	"I must confess that	303:271, 5J  !
3J	I never could see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin;	303:271, 6J  !
3J	her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are	303:271, 7J  !
3J	not at all handsome.  Her nose wants character; there is	303:271, 8J  !
3J	nothing marked in its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but	303:271, 9J  !
3J	not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which	303:271,10J  !
3J	have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive	303:271,11J  !
3J	any thing extraordinary in them.  They have a sharp,	303:271,12J  !
3J	shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her	303:271,13J  !
3J	air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion,	303:271,14J  !
3J	which is intolerable."	303:271,15J  !
3J	"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire,	303:271,23J  !
3J	how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed	303:271,24J  !
3J	beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one	303:271,25J  !
3J	night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ""\She\	303:271,26J  !
3J	a beauty| ~ I should as soon call her mother a wit.""  But	303:271,27J  !
3J	afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe	303:271,28J  !
3J	you thought her rather pretty at one time."	303:271,29J  !
3B	"Yes,"	303:271,30B  !
3B	"but \that\ was only when I first knew her, for it is	303:271,31B  !
3B	many months since I have considered her as one of the	303:271,32B  !
3B	handsomest women of my acquaintance."	303:271,33B  !
3E	"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has	304:273,19E  !
3E	occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but	304:273,20E  !
3E	I am afraid of alarming you ~ be assured that we are all	304:273,21E  !
3E	well.  What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.  An	304:273,22E  !
3E	express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone	304:273,23E  !
3E	to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was	304:273,24E  !
3E	gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the	304:273,25E  !
3E	truth, with Wickham| ~ Imagine our surprise.  To Kitty,	304:273,26E  !
3E	however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.  I am	304:273,27E  !
3E	very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on both sides| ~	304:273,28E  !
3E	But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character	304:273,29E  !
3E	has been misunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can	304:273,30E  !
3E	easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)	304:273,31E  !
3E	marks nothing bad at heart.  His choice is disinterested	304:273,32E  !
3E	at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.	304:273,33E  !
3E	Our poor mother is sadly grieved.  My father bears it	304:274, 1E  !
3E	better.  How thankful am I, that we never let them know	304:274, 2E  !
3E	what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.	304:274, 3E  !
3E	They were off Saturday night about twelve, as	304:274, 4E  !
3E	is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning	304:274, 5E  !
3E	at eight.  The express was sent off directly.  My dear	304:274, 6E  !
3E	Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.	304:274, 7E  !
3E	Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here	304:274, 8E  !
3E	soon.  Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing	304:274, 9E  !
3E	her of their intention.  I must conclude, for I cannot be	304:274,10E  !
3E	long from my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not	304:274,11E  !
3E	be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have	304:274,12E  !
3E	written."	304:274,13E  !
3E	"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received	304:274,19E  !
3E	my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible,	304:274,20E  !
3E	but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered	304:274,21E  !
3E	that I cannot answer for being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy,	304:274,22E  !
3E	I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news	304:274,23E  !
3E	for you, and it cannot be delayed.  Imprudent as a marriage	304:274,24E  !
3E	between Mr% Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we	304:274,25E  !
3E	are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for	304:274,26E  !
3E	there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to	304:274,27E  !
3E	Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left	304:274,28E  !
3E	Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.	304:274,29E  !
3E	Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs% F% gave them to understand	304:274,30E  !
3E	that they were going to Gretna Green, something	304:274,31E  !
3E	was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W% never	304:274,32E  !
3E	intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was	304:274,33E  !
3E	repeated to Colonel F% who instantly taking the alarm,	304:274,34E  !
3E	set off from B% intending to trace their route.  He did	304:274,35E  !
3E	trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on	304:274,36E  !
3E	entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach	304:274,37E  !
3E	and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.	304:274,38E  !
3E	All that is known after this is, that they were seen to	304:275, 1E  !
3E	continue the London road.  I know not what to think.	304:275, 2E  !
3E	After making every possible enquiry on that side London,	304:275, 3E  !
3E	Colonel F% came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing	304:275, 4E  !
3E	them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and	304:275, 5E  !
3E	Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had	304:275, 6E  !
3E	been seen to pass through.  With the kindest concern he	304:275, 7E  !
3E	came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us	304:275, 8E  !
3E	in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely	304:275, 9E  !
3E	grieved for him and Mrs% F% but no one can throw any	304:275,10E  !
3E	blame on them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.	304:275,11E  !
3E	My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot	304:275,12E  !
3E	think so ill of him.  Many circumstances might make it	304:275,13E  !
3E	more eligible for them to be married privately in town than	304:275,14E  !
3E	to pursue their first plan; and even if \he\ could form such	304:275,15E  !
3E	a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections,	304:275,16E  !
3E	which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing?	304:275,17E  !
3E	~ Impossible.  I grieve to find, however, that	304:275,18E  !
3E	Colonel F% is not disposed to depend upon their marriage;	304:275,19E  !
3E	he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said	304:275,20E  !
3E	he feared W% was not a man to be trusted.  My poor	304:275,21E  !
3E	mother is really ill and keeps her room.  Could she exert	304:275,22E  !
3E	herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected;	304:275,23E  !
3E	and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.	304:275,24E  !
3E	Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment;	304:275,25E  !
3E	but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot	304:275,26E  !
3E	wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have	304:275,27E  !
3E	been spared something of these distressing scenes; but	304:275,28E  !
3E	now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for	304:275,29E  !
3E	your return?  I am not so selfish, however, as to press	304:275,30E  !
3E	for it, if inconvenient.  Adieu.  I take up my pen again	304:275,31E  !
3E	to do, what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances	304:275,32E  !
3E	are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging	304:275,33E  !
3E	you all to come here, as soon as possible.  I know my dear	304:275,34E  !
3E	uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting	304:275,35E  !
3E	it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.	304:275,36E  !
3E	My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,	304:275,37E  !
3E	to try to discover her.  What he means to do,	304:275,38E  !
3E	I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not	304:276, 1E  !
3E	allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest	304:276, 2E  !
3E	way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton	304:276, 3E  !
3E	again to-morrow evening.  In such an exigence my uncle's	304:276, 4E  !
3E	advice and assistance would be every thing in the world;	304:276, 5E  !
3E	he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and	304:276, 6E  !
3E	I rely upon his goodness."	304:276, 7E  !
3A	"Oh| where, where is my uncle?"	304:276, 8A  !
3A	"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.  I must find	304:276,16A  !
3A	Mr% Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be	304:276,17A  !
3A	delayed; I have not an instant to lose."	304:276,18A  !
3B	"Good God| what is the matter?"	304:276,19B  !
3B	"I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the	304:276,21B  !
3B	servant, go after Mr% and Mrs% Gardiner.  You are not well	304:276,22B  !
3B	enough; ~ you cannot go yourself."	304:276,23B  !
3B	"Let	304:276,33B  !
3B	me call your maid.  Is there nothing you could take, to	304:276,34B  !
3B	give you present relief? ~ A glass of wine; ~ shall I get	304:276,35B  !
3B	you one? ~ You are very ill."	304:276,36B  !
3A	"No, I thank you;"	304:276,37A  !
3A	"There is nothing the matter with me.	304:276,38A  !
3A	I am quite well.  I am only distressed by some dreadful	304:277, 1A  !
3A	news which I have just received from Longbourn."	304:277, 2A  !
3A	"I have just had a letter from	304:277, 7A  !
3A	Jane, with such dreadful news.  It cannot be concealed	304:277, 8A  !
3A	from any one.  My youngest sister has left all her friends ~	304:277, 9A  !
3A	has eloped; ~ has thrown herself into the power of ~ of	304:277,10A  !
3A	Mr% Wickham.  They are gone off together from Brighton.	304:277,11A  !
3A	\You\ know him too well to doubt the rest.  She has no	304:277,12A  !
3A	money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to ~	304:277,13A  !
3A	she is lost for ever."	304:277,14A  !
3A	"When I consider,"	304:277,15A  !
3A	"that \I\ might	304:277,16A  !
3A	have prevented it| ~ \I\ who knew what he was.  Had I but	304:277,17A  !
3A	explained some part of it only ~ some part of what I learnt,	304:277,18A  !
3A	to my own family|  Had his character been known, this	304:277,19A  !
3A	could not have happened.  But it is all, all too late	304:277,20A  !
3A	now."	304:277,21A  !
3B	"I am grieved, indeed,"	304:277,22B  !
3B	"grieved ~	304:277,22B  !
3B	shocked.  But is it certain, absolutely certain?"	304:277,23B  !
3A	"Oh yes| ~ They left Brighton together on Sunday	304:277,24A  !
3A	night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond;	304:277,25A  !
3A	they are certainly not gone to Scotland."	304:277,26A  !
3B	"And what has been done, what has been attempted,	304:277,27B  !
3B	to recover her?"	304:277,28B  !
3A	"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written	304:277,29A  !
3A	to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be	304:277,30A  !
3A	off, I hope, in half an hour.  But nothing can be done;	304:277,31A  !
3A	I know very well that nothing can be done.  How is such	304:277,32A  !
3A	a man to be worked on?  How are they even to be discovered?	304:277,33A  !
3A	I have not the smallest hope.  It is every way	304:277,34A  !
3A	horrible|"	304:277,35A  !
3A	"When \my\ eyes were opened to his real character. ~	304:277,37A  !
3A	Oh| had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do|	304:277,38A  !
3A	But I knew not ~ I was afraid of doing too much.	304:278, 1A  !
3A	Wretched, wretched, mistake|"	304:278, 2A  !
3B	"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence,	304:278,24B  !
3B	nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but	304:278,25B  !
3B	real, though unavailing, concern.  Would to heaven that	304:278,26B  !
3B	any thing could be either said or done on my part, that	304:278,27B  !
3B	might offer consolation to such distress. ~ But I will not	304:278,28B  !
3B	torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely	304:278,29B  !
3B	to ask for your thanks.  This unfortunate affair will,	304:278,30B  !
3B	I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing	304:278,31B  !
3B	you at Pemberley to day."	304:278,32B  !
3A	"Oh, yes.  Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.	304:278,33A  !
3A	Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.	304:278,34A  !
3A	Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.	304:278,35A  !
3A	~ I know it cannot be long."	304:278,36A  !

3O	us; ~ was it so?"	304:280,38O  !
3A	"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep	304:281, 1A  !
3A	our engagement.  \That\ is all settled."	304:281, 2A  !
3O	"That is all settled;"	304:281, 3O  !
3O	"And are they upon such	304:281, 4O  !
3O	terms as for her to disclose the real truth|  Oh, that	304:281, 5O  !
3O	I knew how it was|"	304:281, 6O  !
3A	"Do you really think so?"	305:282,13A  !
3O	"Upon my word,"	305:282,15O  !
3O	"I begin to be	305:282,15O  !
3O	of your uncle's opinion.  It is really too great a violation	305:282,16O  !
3O	of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of	305:282,17O  !
3O	it.  I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.  Can you,	305:282,18O  !
3O	yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him	305:282,19O  !
3O	capable of it?"	305:282,20O  !
3A	"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.  But of	305:282,21A  !
3A	every other neglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed,	305:282,22A  !
3A	it should be so|  But I dare not hope it.  Why should	305:282,23A  !
3A	they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"	305:282,24A  !
3A	"Oh| but their removing from the chaise into an	305:282,27A  !
3A	hackney coach is such a presumption|  And, besides, no	305:282,28A  !
3A	traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."	305:282,29A  !
3A	"But why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?	305:283, 4A  !
3A	Why must their marriage be private?  Oh| no, no, this	305:283, 5A  !
3A	is not likely.  His most particular friend, you see by	305:283, 6A  !
3A	Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to	305:283, 7A  !
3A	marry her.  Wickham will never marry a woman without	305:283, 8A  !
3A	some money.  He cannot afford it.  And what claims has	305:283, 9A  !
3A	Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and	305:283,10A  !
3A	good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego	305:283,11A  !
3A	every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?  As	305:283,12A  !
3A	to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps	305:283,13A  !
3A	might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am	305:283,14A  !
3A	not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that	305:283,15A  !
3A	such a step might produce.  But as to your other objection,	305:283,16A  !
3A	I am afraid it will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no	305:283,17A  !
3A	brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from	305:283,18A  !
3A	my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little	305:283,19A  !
3A	attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going	305:283,20A  !
3A	forward in his family, that \he\ would do as little, and	305:283,21A  !
3A	think as little about it, as any father could do, in such	305:283,22A  !
3A	a matter."	305:283,23A  !
3A	"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"	305:283,27A  !
3A	"that a sister's sense	305:283,28A  !
3A	of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of	305:283,29A  !
3A	doubt.  But, really, I know not what to say.  Perhaps	305:283,30A  !
3A	I am not doing her justice.  But she is very young; she	305:283,31A  !
3A	has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and	305:283,32A  !
3A	for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has	305:283,33A  !
3A	been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.	305:283,34A  !
3A	She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most	305:283,35A  !
3A	idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions	305:283,36A  !
3A	that came in her way.  Since the @@@@ shire were first	305:283,37A  !
3A	quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and	305:283,38A  !
3A	officers, have been in her head.  She has been doing	305:284, 1A  !
3A	every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the	305:284, 2A  !
3A	subject, to give greater ~ what shall I call it? susceptibility	305:284, 3A  !
3A	to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	305:284, 4A  !
3A	And we all know that Wickham has every charm of	305:284, 5A  !
3A	person and address that can captivate a woman."	305:284, 6A  !
3O	"But you see that Jane,"	305:284, 7O  !
3O	"does not	305:284, 7O  !
3O	think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the	305:284, 8O  !
3O	attempt."	305:284, 9O  !
3A	"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there,	305:284,10A  !
3A	whatever might be their former conduct, that she would	305:284,11A  !
3A	believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved	305:284,12A  !
3A	against them?  But Jane knows, as well as I do, what	305:284,13A  !
3A	Wickham really is.  We both know that he has been	305:284,14A  !
3A	profligate in every sense of the word.  That he has neither	305:284,15A  !
3A	integrity nor honour.  That he is as false and deceitful,	305:284,16A  !
3A	as he is insinuating."	305:284,17A  !
3O	"And do you really know all this?"	305:284,18O  !
3A	"I do, indeed,"	305:284,21A  !
3A	"I told	305:284,21A  !
3A	you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr% Darcy;	305:284,22A  !
3A	and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what	305:284,23A  !
3A	manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such	305:284,24A  !
3A	forbearance and liberality towards him.  And there are	305:284,25A  !
3A	other circumstances which I am not at liberty ~ which it	305:284,26A  !
3A	is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole	305:284,27A  !
3A	Pemberley family are endless.  From what he said of	305:284,28A  !
3A	Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,	305:284,29A  !
3A	reserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary	305:284,30A  !
3A	himself.  He must know that she was as amiable and	305:284,31A  !
3A	unpretending as we have found her."	305:284,32A  !
3O	"But does Lydia know nothing of this?  Can she be	305:284,33O  !
3O	ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"	305:284,34O  !
3A	"Oh, yes| ~ that, that is the worst of all.  Till I was	305:284,36A  !
3A	in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr% Darcy and his	305:284,37A  !
3A	relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth	305:284,38A  !
3A	myself.  And when I returned home, the @@@@ shire was	305:285, 1A  !
3A	to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.  As that	305:285, 2A  !
3A	was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole,	305:285, 3A  !
3A	nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public;	305:285, 4A  !
3A	for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that	305:285, 5A  !
3A	the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of	305:285, 6A  !
3A	him, should then be overthrown?  And even when it was	305:285, 7A  !
3A	settled that Lydia should go with Mrs% Forster, the necessity	305:285, 8A  !
3A	of opening her eyes to his character never occurred	305:285, 9A  !
3A	to me.  That \she\ could be in any danger from the deception	305:285,10A  !
3A	never entered my head.  That such a consequence as \this\	305:285,11A  !
3A	should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from	305:285,12A  !
3A	my thoughts."	305:285,13A  !
3O	"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you	305:285,14O  !
3O	had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each	305:285,15O  !
3O	other."	305:285,16O  !
3A	"Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of	305:285,17A  !
3A	affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind	305:285,18A  !
3A	been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a	305:285,19A  !
3A	family, on which it could be thrown away.  When first	305:285,20A  !
3A	he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire	305:285,21A  !
3A	him; but so we all were.  Every girl in, or near Meryton,	305:285,22A  !
3A	was out of her senses about him for the first two months;	305:285,23A  !
3A	but he never distinguished \her\ by any particular attention,	305:285,24A  !
3A	and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant	305:285,25A  !
3A	and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others	305:285,26A  !
3A	of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction,	305:285,27A  !
3A	again became her favourites."	305:285,28A  !
3E	"Not yet,"	305:286,18E  !
3E	"But now that my dear	305:286,18E  !
3E	uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well."	305:286,19E  !
3A	"Is my father in town?"	305:286,20A  !
3E	"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."	305:286,21E  !
3A	"And have you heard from him often?"	305:286,22A  !
3E	"We have heard only once.  He wrote me a few lines	305:286,23E  !
3E	on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and	305:286,24E  !
3E	to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him	305:286,25E  !
3E	to do.  He merely added, that he should not write again,	305:286,26E  !
3E	till he had something of importance to mention."	305:286,27E  !
3A	"And my mother ~ How is she?  How are you all?"	305:286,28A  !
3E	"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her	305:286,29E  !
3E	spirits are greatly shaken.  She is up stairs, and will have	305:286,30E  !
3E	great satisfaction in seeing you all.  She does not yet	305:286,31E  !
3E	leave her dressing-room.  Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven|	305:286,32E  !
3E	are quite well."	305:286,33E  !
3A	"But you ~ How are you?"	305:286,34A  !
3A	"You	305:286,34A  !
3A	look pale.  How much you must have gone through|"	305:286,35A  !
3D	"If I had been able,"	305:287,22D  !
3D	"to carry my point of	305:287,22D  !
3D	going to Brighton, with all my family, \this\ would not	305:287,23D  !
3D	have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to	305:287,24D  !
3D	take care of her.  Why did the Forsters ever let her go	305:287,25D  !
3D	out of their sight?  I am sure there was some great	305;287,26D  !
3D	neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of	305:287,27D  !
3D	girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.	305:287,28D  !
3D	I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge	305:287,29D  !
3D	of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.  Poor	305:287,30D  !
3D	dear child|  And now here's Mr% Bennet gone away, and	305:287,31D  !
3D	I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him,	305:287,32D  !
3D	and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?	305:287,33D  !
3D	The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his	305:287,33D  !
3D	grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not	305:287,34D  !
3D	know what we shall do."	305:287,35D  !
3D	"Oh| my dear brother,"	305:288,14D  !
3D	"that	305:288,14D  !
3D	is exactly what I could most wish for.  And now do,	305:288,15D  !
3D	when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may	305:288,16D  !
3D	be; and if they are not married already, \make\ them	305:288,17D  !
3D	marry.  And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait	305:288,18D  !
3D	for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money	305:288,19D  !
3D	as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.  And,	305:288,20D  !
3D	above all things, keep Mr% Bennet from fighting.  Tell	305:288,21D  !
3D	him what a dreadful state I am in, ~ that I am frightened	305:288,22D  !
3D	out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings,	305:288,23D  !
3D	all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in	305:288,24D  !
3D	my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no	305:288,25D  !
3D	rest by night nor by day.  And tell my dear Lydia, not	305:288,26D  !
3D	to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen	305:288,27D  !
3D	me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	305:288,28D  !
3D	Oh, brother, how kind you are|  I know you will contrive	305:288,29D  !
3D	it all."	305:288,30D  !
3A	"But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have	305:290, 6A  !
3A	not already heard.  Give me farther particulars.  What	305:290, 7A  !
3A	did Colonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of	305:290, 8A  !
3A	any thing before the elopement took place?  They must	305:290, 9A  !
3A	have seen them together for ever."	305:290,10A  !
3E	"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected	305:290,11E  !
3E	some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing	305:290,12E  !
3E	to give him any alarm.  I am so grieved for him.  His	305:290,13E  !
3E	behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.  He \was\	305:290,14E  !
3E	coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he	305:290,15E  !
3E	had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland:  when	305:290,16E  !
3E	that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	305:290,17E  !
3A	"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not	305:290,18A  !
3A	marry?  Did he know of their intending to go off?  Had	305:290,19A  !
3A	Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"	305:290,20A  !
3E	"Yes; but when questioned by \him\ Denny denied	305:290,21E  !
3E	knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his	305:290,22E  !
3E	real opinion about it.  He did not repeat his persuasion	305:290,23E  !
3E	of their not marrying ~ and from \that\, I am inclined to	305:290,24E  !
3E	hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	305:290,25E  !
3A	"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you	305:290,26A  !
3A	entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really	305:290,27A  !
3A	married?"	305:290,28A  !
3E	"How was it possible that such an idea should enter	305:290,29E  !
3E	our brains|  I felt a little uneasy ~ a little fearful of my	305:290,30E  !
3E	sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew	305:290,31E  !
3E	that his conduct had not been always quite right.  My	305:290,32E  !
3E	father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt	305:290,33E  !
3E	how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then owned,	305:290,34E  !
3E	with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the	305:290,35E  !
3E	rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared	305:290,36E  !
3E	her for such a step.  She had known, it seems, of their	305:290,37E  !
3E	being in love with each other, many weeks."	305:290,38E  !
3A	"But not before they went to Brighton?"	305:291, 1A  !
3E	"No, I believe not."	305:291, 2E  !
3A	"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham	305:291, 3A  !
3A	himself?  Does he know his real character?"	305:291, 4A  !
3E	"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham	305:291, 5E  !
3E	as he formerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent	305:291, 6E  !
3E	and extravagant.  And since this sad affair has taken	305:291, 7E  !
3E	place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but	305:291, 8E  !
3E	I hope this may be false."	305:291, 9E  !
3A	"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what	305:291,10A  !
3A	we knew of him, this could not have happened|"	305:291,11A  !
3E	"Perhaps it would have been better;"	305:291,12E  !
3E	"But to expose the former faults of any person,	305:291,13E  !
3E	without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed	305:291,14E  !
3E	unjustifiable.  We acted with the best intentions."	305:291,15E  !
3A	"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's	305:291,16A  !
3A	note to his wife?"	305:291,17A  !
3E	"He brought it with him for us to see."	305:291,18E  !
3H	"MY DEAR HARRIET,	305:291,22H  !

3H	and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow	305:291,24H  !
3H	morning, as soon as I am missed.  I am going to	305:291,25H  !
3H	Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall	305:291,26H  !
3H	think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the	305:291,27H  !
3H	world I love, and he is an angel.  I should never be happy	305:291,28H  !
3H	without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You need	305:291,29H  !
3H	not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you	305:291,30H  !
3H	do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,	305:291,31H  !
3H	when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia Wickham.	305:291,32H  !
3H	What a good joke it will be|  I can hardly write for	305:291,33H  !
3H	laughing.  Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping	305:291,34H  !
3H	my engagement, and dancing with him to night.  Tell	305:291,35H  !
3H	him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell	305:291,36H  !
3H	him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with	305:291,37H  !
3H	great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when I get	305:291,38H  !
3H	to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend	305:292, 1H  !
3H	a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are	305:292, 2H  !
3H	packed up.  Good bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster,	305:292, 3H  !
3H	I hope you will drink to our good journey.	305:292, 4H  !

3A	"Oh| thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia|"	305:292, 8A  !
3A	"What a letter is this,	305:292, 9A  !
3A	to be written at such a moment.  But at least it shews,	305:292,10A  !
3A	that \she\ was serious in the object of her journey.  Whatever	305:292,11A  !
3A	he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her	305:292,12A  !
3A	side a \scheme\ of infamy.  My poor father| how he must	305:292,13A  !
3A	have felt it|"	305:292,14A  !
3E	"I never saw any one so shocked.  He could not speak	305:292,15E  !
3E	a word for full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill	305:292,16E  !
3E	immediately, and the whole house in such confusion|"	305:292,17E  !
3A	"Oh| Jane,"	305:292,18A  !
3A	"was there a servant	305:292,18A  !

3A	the end of the day?"	305:292,20A  !
3E	"I do not know. ~ I hope there was. ~ But to be guarded	305:292,21E  !
3E	at such a time, is very difficult.  My mother was in	305:292,22E  !
3E	hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every	305:292,23E  !
3E	assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much	305:292,24E  !
3E	as I might have done|  But the horror of what might	305:292,25E  !
3E	possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties."	305:292,26E  !
3A	"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for	305:292,27A  !
3A	you.  You do not look well.  Oh| that I had been with	305:292,28A  !
3A	you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself	305:292,29A  !

3E	"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would	305:292,31E  !
3E	have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not	305:292,32E  !
3E	think it right for either of them.  Kitty is slight and	305:292,33E  !
3E	delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of	305:292,34E  !
3E	repose should not be broken in on.  My aunt Phillips	305:292,35E  !
3E	came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went	305:292,36E  !

3E	She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas	305:292,38E  !
3E	has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday	305:293, 1E  !
3E	morning to condole with us, and offered her services,	305:293, 2E  !
3E	or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us."	305:293, 3E  !
3A	"She had better have stayed at home,"	305:293, 4A  !
3A	"perhaps she \meant\ well, but, under such a misfortune	305:293, 5A  !
3A	as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.	305:293, 6A  !
3A	Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.  Let	305:293, 7A  !
3A	them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	305:293, 8A  !
3E	"He meant, I believe,"	305:293,12E  !
3E	"to go to Epsom,	305:293,12E  !
3E	the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions,	305:293,13E  !
3E	and try if any thing could be made out from them.  His	305:293,14E  !
3E	principal object must be, to discover the number of the	305:293,15E  !
3E	hackney coach which took them from Clapham.  It had	305:293,16E  !
3E	come with a fare from London; and as he thought the	305:293,17E  !
3E	circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from	305:293,18E  !
3E	one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant	305:293,19E  !
3E	to make enquiries at Clapham.  If he could any how discover	305:293,20E  !
3E	at what house the coachman had before set down	305:293,21E  !
3E	his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped	305:293,22E  !
3E	it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number	305:293,23E  !
3E	of the coach.  I do not know of any other designs that	305:293,24E  !
3E	he had formed:  but he was in such a hurry to be gone,	305:293,25E  !
3E	and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty	305:293,26E  !
3E	in finding out even so much as this."	305:293,27E  !
3K	"MY DEAR SIR,	306:296,26K  !
3K	"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and	306:296,27K  !
3K	my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous	306:296,28K  !
3K	affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were	306:296,29K  !
3K	yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.  Be	306:296,30K  !
3K	assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs% Collins and myself sincerely	306:296,31K  !
3K	sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in	306:296,32K  !
3K	your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind,	306:296,33K  !
3K	because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	306:296,34K  !
3K	No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can	306:296,35K  !
3K	alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort	306:296,36K  !
3K	you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most	306:296,37K  !
3K	afflicting to a parent's mind.  The death of your daughter	306:296,38K  !
3K	would have been a blessing in comparison of this.  And	306:297, 1K  !
3K	it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to	306:297, 2K  !
3K	suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this	306:297, 3K  !
3K	licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded	306:297, 4K  !
3K	from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the	306:297, 5K  !
3K	same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs% Bennet,	306:297, 6K  !
3K	I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be	306:297, 7K  !
3K	naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an	306:297, 8K  !
3K	enormity, at so early an age.  Howsoever that may be,	306:297, 9K  !
3K	you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not	306:297,10K  !
3K	only joined by Mrs% Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine	306:297,11K  !
3K	and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.	306:297,12K  !
3K	They agree with me in apprehending that this false step	306:297,13K  !
3K	in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all	306:297,14K  !
3K	the others, for who, as lady Catherine herself condescendingly	306:297,15K  !
3K	says, will connect themselves with such a family.	306:297,16K  !
3K	And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with	306:297,17K  !
3K	augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November,	306:297,18K  !
3K	for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved	306:297,19K  !
3K	in all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me advise you then,	306:297,20K  !
3K	my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to	306:297,21K  !
3K	throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever,	306:297,22K  !
3K	and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous	306:297,23K  !
3K	offence.	306:297,24K  !
3K	"I am, dear Sir, &c% &c%"	306:297,25K  !
3E	"A gamester|"	306:298, 7E  !
3E	"This is	306:298, 7E  !
3E	wholly unexpected.  I had not an idea of it."	306:298, 8E  !
3D	"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia|"	306:298,19D  !
3D	"Sure he will not leave London before he has	306:298,20D  !
3D	found them.  Who is to fight Wickham, and make him	306:298,21D  !
3D	marry her, if he comes away?"	306:298,22D  !
3C	"Say nothing of that.	306:299,15C  !
3C	Who should suffer but myself?  It has been my own	306:299,16C  !
3C	doing, and I ought to feel it."	306:299,17C  !
3A	"You must not be too severe upon yourself,"	306:299,18A  !
3C	"You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human	306:299,20C  !
3C	nature is so prone to fall into it|  No, Lizzy, let me once	306:299,21C  !
3C	in my life feel how much I have been to blame.  I am not	306:299,22C  !
3C	afraid of being overpowered by the impression.  It will	306:299,23C  !
3C	pass away soon enough."	306:299,24C  !
3A	"Do you suppose them to be in London?"	306:299,25A  !
3C	"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?'	306:299,26C  !
3C	"She is happy, then,"	306:299,29C  !
3C	"and	306:299,29C  !
3C	her residence there will probably be of some duration."	306:299,30C  !
3C	"Lizzy, I bear	306:299,31C  !
3C	you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me	306:299,32C  !
3C	last May, which, considering the event, shews some	306:299,33C  !
3C	greatness of mind."	306:299,34C  !
3C	"This is a parade,"	306:299,37C  !
3C	"which does one good;	306:299,37C  !
3C	it gives such an elegance to misfortune|  Another day	306:299,38C  !
3C	I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap	306:300, 1C  !
3C	and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can, ~	306:300, 2C  !
3C	or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away."	306:300, 3C  !
3C	"You go to Brighton| ~ I would not trust you so near	306:300, 7C  !
3C	it as East Bourne, for fifty pounds|  No, Kitty, I have	306:300, 8C  !
3C	at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects	306:300, 9C  !
3C	of it.  No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even	306:300,10C  !
3C	to pass through the village.  Balls will be absolutely	306:300,11C  !
3C	prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	306:300,12C  !
3C	And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove,	306:300,13C  !
3C	that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational	306:300,14C  !
3C	manner."	306:300,15C  !
3C	"Well, well,"	306:300,18C  !
3C	"do not make yourself unhappy.	306:300,18C  !
3C	If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take	306:300,19C  !
3C	you to a review at the end of them."	306:300,20C  !
3E	"What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing	307:301,11E  !
3E	from town."	307:301,12E  !
3A	"Oh, Papa, what news?  what news?  have you heard	307:301,32A  !
3A	from my uncle?"	307:301,33A  !
3C	"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."	307:302, 1C  !
3A	"Well, and what news does it bring?  good or bad?"	307:302, 2A  !
3C	"What is there of good to be expected?"	307:302, 3C  !
3C	"but perhaps you	307:302, 4C  !
3C	would like to read it."	307:302, 5C  !
3C	"Read it aloud,"	307:302, 8C  !
3C	"for I hardly know	307:302, 8C  !
3C	myself what it is about."	307:302, 9C  !
3E	"Then it is, as I always hoped,"	307:302,20E  !
3E	"they	307:302,20E  !
3E	are married|"	307:302,21E  !
3A	"Is it possible|"	307:303,17A  !
3A	"Can it be possible that he will marry her?"	307:303,18A  !
3E	"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have	307:303,19E  !
3E	thought him;"	307:303,20E  !
3E	"My dear father, I congratulate	307:303,20E  !
3E	you."	307:303,21E  !
3A	"And have you answered the letter?"	307:303,22A  !
3C	"No; but it must be done soon."	307:303,23C  !
3C	Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more	307:303,24C  !
3C	time before he wrote.	307:303,25C  !
3A	"Oh| my dear father,"	307:303,26A  !
3A	"come back, and	307:303,26A  !
3A	write immediately.  Consider how important every	307:303,27A  !
3A	moment is, in such a case."	307:303,28A  !
3E	"Let me write for you,"	307:303,29E  !
3E	"if you dislike the	307:303,29E  !
3E	trouble yourself."	307:303,30E  !
3C	"I dislike it very much,"	307:303,31C  !
3C	"but it must	307:303,31C  !
3C	be done."	307:303,32C  !
3A	"And may I ask?"	307:303,35A  !
3A	"but the terms,	307:303,35A  !
3A	I suppose, must be complied with."	307:303,36A  !
3C	"Complied with|  I am only ashamed of his asking so	307:303,37C  !
3C	little."	307:303,38C  !
3A	"And they \must\ marry|  Yet he is \such\ a man|"	307:304, 1A  !
3C	"Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to	307:304, 2C  !
3C	be done.  But there are two things that I want very much	307:304, 3C  !
3C	to know: ~ one is, how much money your uncle has laid	307:304, 4C  !
3C	down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever	307:304, 5C  !
3C	to pay him."	307:304, 6C  !
3E	"Money|  my uncle|"	307:304, 7E  !
3E	"what do you	307:304, 7E  !
3E	mean, Sir?"	307:304, 8E  !
3C	"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia	307:304, 9C  !
3C	on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during	307:304,10C  !
3C	my life, and fifty after I am gone."	307:304,11C  !
3A	"That is very true,"	307:304,12A  !
3A	"though it had	307:304,12A  !
3A	not occurred to me before.  His debts to be discharged,	307:304,13A  !
3A	and something still to remain|  Oh| it must be my	307:304,14A  !
3A	uncle's doings|  Generous, good man, I am afraid he has	307:304,15A  !
3A	distressed himself.  A small sum could not do all this."	307:304,16A  !
3C	"No,"	307:304,17C  !
3C	"Wickham's a fool, if he	307:304,17C  !
3C	takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	307:304,18C  !
3C	I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning	307:304,19C  !
3C	of our relationship."	307:304,20C  !
3A	"Ten thousand pounds|  Heaven forbid|  How is half	307:304,21A  !
3A	such a sum to be repaid?"	307:304,22A  !
3A	"And they are really to be married|"	307:304,27A  !
3A	"How strange this	307:304,28A  !
3A	is|  And for \this\ we are to be thankful.  That they should	307:304,29A  !
3A	marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched	307:304,30A  !
3A	as is his character, we are forced to rejoice|  Oh, Lydia|"	307:304,31A  !
3E	"I comfort myself with thinking,"	307:304,32E  !
3E	"that	307:304,32E  !
3E	he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real	307:304,33E  !
3E	regard for her.  Though our kind uncle has done something	307:304,34E  !
3E	towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand	307:304,35E  !
3E	pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.  He has	307:304,36E  !
3E	children of his own, and may have more.  How could he	307:304,37E  !
3E	spare half ten thousand pounds?"	307:304,38E  !
3A	"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts	307:305, 1A  !
3A	have been,"	307:305, 2A  !
3A	"and how much is settled on his	307:305, 2A  !
3A	side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr% Gardiner	307:305, 3A  !
3A	has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence	307:305, 4A  !
3A	of his own.  The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never	307:305, 5A  !
3A	be requited.  Their taking her home, and affording her	307:305, 6A  !
3A	their personal protection and countenance, is such a	307:305, 7A  !
3A	sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot	307:305, 8A  !
3A	enough acknowledge.  By this time she is actually with	307:305, 9A  !
3A	them|  If such goodness does not make her miserable	307:305,10A  !
3A	now, she will never deserve to be happy|  What a meeting	307:305,11A  !
3A	for her, when she first sees my aunt|"	307:305,12A  !
3E	"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on	307:305,13E  !
3E	either side,"	307:305,14E  !
3E	"I hope and trust they will yet	307:305,14E  !
3E	be happy.  His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will	307:305,15E  !
3E	believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.  Their	307:305,16E  !
3E	mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself	307:305,17E  !
3E	they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner,	307:305,18E  !
3E	as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."	307:305,19E  !
3A	"Their conduct has been such,"	307:305,20A  !
3A	"as	307:305,20A  !
3A	neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.  It is	307:305,21A  !
3A	useless to talk of it."	307:305,22A  !
3C	"Just as you please."	307:305,29C  !
3A	"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"	307:305,30A  !
3C	"Take whatever you like, and get away."	307:305,31C  !
3D	"My dear, dear Lydia|"	307:306, 7D  !

3D	his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever	307:306,30D  !

3D	I am so happy.  In a short time, I shall have a daughter	307:306,32D  !

3D	of the young men, too, that she likes very much.  The	308:313,34D  !
3D	officers may not be so pleasant in General @@@@'s	308:313,35D  !
3D	regiment."	308:313,36D  !
3H	"Only think of its being three months,"	309:316,21H  !
3H	"since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare;	309:316,22H  !
3H	and yet there have been things enough happened in the	309:316,23H  !
3H	time.  Good gracious|  when I went away, I am sure	309:316,24H  !
3H	I had no more idea of being married till I came back	309:316,25H  !
3H	again|  though I thought it would be very good fun if	309:316,26H  !
3H	I was."	309:316,27H  !
3H	"Oh| mamma, do the people	309:316,31H  !
3H	here abouts know I am married to-day?  I was afraid	309:316,32H  !
3H	they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in	309:316,33H  !
3H	his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and	309:316,34H  !
3H	so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my	309:316,35H  !
3H	glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame,	309:316,36H  !
3H	so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and	309:316,37H  !
3H	smiled like any thing."	309:316,38H  !
3H	"Ah| Jane, I take	309:317, 6H  !
3H	your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a	309:317, 7H  !
3H	married woman."	309:317, 8H  !
3H	"Well, mamma,"	309:317,17H  !
3H	"and what do you think of my	309:317,18H  !
3H	husband?  Is not he a charming man?  I am sure my	309:317,19H  !
3H	sisters must all envy me.  I only hope they may have	309:317,20H  !
3H	half my good luck.  They must all go to Brighton.  That	309:317,21H  !
3H	is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it is, mamma,	309:317,22H  !
3H	we did not all go."	309:317,23H  !
3D	"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But	309:317,24D  !
3D	my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way	309:317,25D  !
3D	off.  Must it be so?"	309:317,26D  !
3H	"Oh, lord| yes; ~ there is nothing in that.  I shall	309:317,27H  !
3H	like it of all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must	309:317,28H  !
3H	come down and see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the	309:317,29H  !
3H	winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will	309:317,30H  !
3H	take care to get good partners for them all."	309:317,31H  !
3D	"I should like it beyond any thing|"	309:317,32D  !
3H	"And then when you go away, you may leave one	309:317,33H  !
3H	or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall	309:317,34H  !
3H	get husbands for them before the winter is over."	309:317,35H  !
3A	"I thank you for my share of the favour,"	309:317,36A  !
3A	"but I do not particularly like your way of getting	309:317,37A  !
3A	husbands."	309:317,38A  !
3H	"Lizzy, I never gave \you\ an account of my wedding,	309:318,29H  !
3H	I believe.  You were not by, when I told mamma, and the	309:318,30H  !
3H	others, all about it.  Are not you curious to hear how it	309:318,31H  !
3H	was managed?"	309:318,32H  !
3A	"No really,"	309:318,33A  !
3A	"I think there cannot	309:318,33A  !
3A	be too little said on the subject."	309:318,34A  !
3H	"La|  You are so strange|  But I must tell you how	309:318,35H  !
3H	it went off.  We were married, you know, at St% Clement's,	309:318,36H  !
3H	because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.  And	309:318,37H  !
3H	it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.	309:318,38H  !
3H	My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the	309:319, 1H  !
3H	others were to meet us at the church.  Well, Monday	309:319, 2H  !
3H	morning came, and I was in such a fuss|  I was so afraid	309:319, 3H  !
3H	you know that something would happen to put it off, and	309:319, 4H  !
3H	then I should have gone quite distracted.  And there was	309:319, 5H  !
3H	my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and	309:319, 6H  !
3H	talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However,	309:319, 7H  !
3H	I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was	309:319, 8H  !
3H	thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed	309:319, 9H  !
3H	to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	309:319,10H  !
3H	"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I	309:319,11H  !
3H	thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are	309:319,12H  !
3H	to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid	309:319,13H  !
3H	unpleasant all the time I was with them.  If you'll believe	309:319,14H  !
3H	me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was	309:319,15H  !
3H	there a fortnight.  Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	309:319,16H  !
3H	To be sure London was rather thin, but however the	309:319,17H  !
3H	little Theatre was open.  Well, and so just as the carriage	309:319,18H  !
3H	came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business	309:319,19H  !
3H	to that horrid man Mr% Stone.  And then, you know,	309:319,20H  !
3H	when once they get together, there is no end of it.  Well,	309:319,21H  !
3H	I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my	309:319,22H  !
3H	uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the	309:319,23H  !
3H	hour, we could not be married all day.  But, luckily, he	309:319,24H  !
3H	came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all	309:319,25H  !
3H	set out.  However, I recollected afterwards, that if he	309:319,26H  !
3H	\had\ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put	309:319,27H  !
3H	off, for Mr% Darcy might have done as well."	309:319,28H  !
3A	"Mr% Darcy|"	309:319,29A  !
3H	"Oh, yes| ~ he was to come there with Wickham, you	309:319,30H  !
3H	know.  But gracious me|  I quite forgot|  I ought not to	309:319,31H  !
3H	have said a word about it.  I promised them so faithfully|	309:319,32H  !
3H	What will Wickham say?  It was to be such a secret|"	309:319,33H  !
3E	"If it was to be secret,"	309:319,34E  !
3E	"say not another	309:319,34E  !
3E	word on the subject.  You may depend upon my seeking	309:319,35E  !
3E	no further."	309:319,36E  !
3A	"Oh| certainly,"	309:319,37A  !
3A	"we will ask you no questions."	309:319,38A  !
3H	"Thank you,"	309:320, 1H  !
3H	"for if you did, I should	309:320, 1H  !
3H	certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be	309:320, 2H  !
3H	angry."	309:320, 3H  !
3A	"You may readily comprehend,"	309:320,19A  !
3A	"what my	309:320,19A  !
3A	curiosity must be to know how a person so unconnected with	309:320,20A  !
3A	any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our	309:320,21A  !
3A	family, should have been amongst you at such a time.	309:320,22A  !
3A	Pray write instantly, and let me understand it ~ unless it	309:320,23A  !
3A	is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which	309:320,24A  !
3A	Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour	309:320,25A  !
3A	to be satisfied with ignorance."	309:320,26A  !
3O	"Gracechurch-street, Sept% 6.	310:321, 9O  !
3O	"MY DEAR NIECE,	310:321,10O  !
3O	"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this	310:321,11O  !
3O	whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a \little\	310:321,12O  !
3O	writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must	310:321,13O  !
3O	confess myself surprised by your application; I did not	310:321,14O  !
3O	expect it from \you\.  Don't think me angry, however, for I	310:321,15O  !
3O	only mean to let you know, that I had not imagined such	310:321,16O  !
3O	enquiries to be necessary on \your\ side.  If you do not	310:321,17O  !
3O	choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.  Your	310:321,18O  !
3O	uncle is as much surprised as I am ~ and nothing but the	310:321,19O  !
3O	belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed	310:321,20O  !
3O	him to act as he has done.  But if you are really innocent	310:321,21O  !
3O	and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the very day	310:321,22O  !
3O	of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a	310:321,23O  !
3O	most unexpected visitor.  Mr% Darcy called, and was shut	310:321,24O  !
3O	up with him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived;	310:321,25O  !
3O	so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as \your's\	310:321,26O  !
3O	seems to have been.  He came to tell Mr% Gardiner that	310:321,27O  !
3O	he had found out where your sister and Mr% Wickham were,	310:321,28O  !
3O	and that he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham	310:321,29O  !
3O	repeatedly, Lydia once.  From what I can collect, he left	310:321,30O  !
3O	Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to	310:321,31O  !
3O	town with the resolution of hunting for them.  The motive	310:321,32O  !
3O	professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself	310:321,33O  !
3O	that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known,	310:321,34O  !
3O	as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,	310:322, 1O  !
3O	to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the	310:322, 2O  !
3O	whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he	310:322, 3O  !
3O	had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private	310:322, 4O  !
3O	actions open to the world.  His character was to speak	310:322, 5O  !
3O	for itself.  He called it, therefore, his duty to step	310:322, 6O  !
3O	forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had	310:322, 7O  !
3O	been brought on by himself.  If he \had\ \another\ motive,	310:322, 8O  !
3O	I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He had	310:322, 9O  !
3O	been some days in town, before he was able to discover	310:322,10O  !
3O	them; but he had something to direct his search, which	310:322,11O  !
3O	was more than \we\ had; and the consciousness of this,	310:322,12O  !
3O	was another reason for his resolving to follow us.  There	310:322,13O  !
3O	is a lady, it seems, a Mrs% Younge, who was some	310:322,14O  !
3O	time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed	310:322,15O  !
3O	from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though	310:322,16O  !
3O	he did not say what.  She then took a large house in	310:322,17O  !
3O	Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting	310:322,18O  !
3O	lodgings.  This Mrs% Younge was, he knew, intimately	310:322,19O  !
3O	acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence	310:322,20O  !
3O	of him, as soon as he got to town.  But it was	310:322,21O  !
3O	two or three days before he could get from her what he	310:322,22O  !
3O	wanted.  She would not betray her trust, I suppose,	310:322,23O  !
3O	without bribery and corruption, for she really did know	310:322,24O  !
3O	where her friend was to be found.  Wickham indeed had	310:322,25O  !
3O	gone to her, on their first arrival in London, and had she	310:322,26O  !
3O	been able to receive them into her house, they would	310:322,27O  !
3O	have taken up their abode with her.  At length, however,	310:322,28O  !
3O	our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They	310:322,29O  !
3O	were in @@@@ street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards	310:322,30O  !
3O	insisted on seeing Lydia.  His first object with her, he	310:322,31O  !
3O	acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her	310:322,32O  !
3O	present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as	310:322,33O  !
3O	soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering	310:322,34O  !
3O	his assistance, as far as it would go.  But he found Lydia	310:322,35O  !
3O	absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.  She	310:322,36O  !
3O	cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his,	310:322,37O  !
3O	she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure	310:322,38O  !
3O	they should be married some time or other, and it did	310:323, 1O  !
3O	not much signify when.  Since such were her feelings,	310:323, 2O  !
3O	it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite	310:323, 3O  !
3O	a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with	310:323, 4O  !
3O	Wickham, he easily learnt, had never been \his\ design.	310:323, 5O  !
3O	He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on	310:323, 6O  !
3O	account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing;	310:323, 7O  !
3O	and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's	310:323, 8O  !
3O	flight, on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign his	310:323, 9O  !
3O	commission immediately; and as to his future situation,	310:323,10O  !
3O	he could conjecture very little about it.  He must go	310:323,11O  !
3O	somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he	310:323,12O  !
3O	should have nothing to live on.  Mr% Darcy asked him	310:323,13O  !
3O	why he had not married your sister at once.  Though	310:323,14O  !
3O	Mr% Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would	310:323,15O  !
3O	have been able to do something for him, and his situation	310:323,16O  !
3O	must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found,	310:323,17O  !
3O	in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished	310:323,18O  !
3O	the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage,	310:323,19O  !
3O	in some other country.  Under such circumstances,	310:323,20O  !
3O	however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation	310:323,21O  !
3O	of immediate relief.  They met several times, for	310:323,22O  !
3O	there was much to be discussed.  Wickham of course	310:323,23O  !
3O	wanted more than he could get; but at length was	310:323,24O  !
3O	reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled	310:323,25O  !
3O	between \them\, Mr% Darcy's next step was to make your	310:323,26O  !
3O	uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street	310:323,27O  !
3O	the evening before I came home.  But Mr% Gardiner	310:323,28O  !
3O	could not be seen, and Mr% Darcy found, on further enquiry,	310:323,29O  !
3O	that your father was still with him, but would quit town	310:323,30O  !
3O	the next morning.  He did not judge your father to be	310:232,31O  !
3O	a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle,	310:323,32O  !
3O	and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the	310:323,33O  !
3O	departure of the former.  He did not leave his name, and	310:323,34O  !
3O	till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had	310:323,35O  !
3O	called on business.  On Saturday he came again.  Your	310:323,36O  !
3O	father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before,	310:323,37O  !
3O	they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again on	310:323,38O  !
3O	Sunday, and then \I\ saw him too.  It was not all settled	310:324, 1O  !
3O	before Monday:  as soon as it was, the express was sent	310:324, 2O  !
3O	off to Longbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.	310:324, 3O  !
3O	I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his	310:324, 4O  !
3O	character after all.  He has been accused of many faults	310:324, 5O  !
3O	at different times; but \this\ is the true one.  Nothing was	310:324, 6O  !
3O	to be done that he did not do himself; though I am	310:324, 7O  !
3O	sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say	310:324, 8O  !
3O	nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have	310:324, 9O  !
3O	settled the whole.  They battled it together for a long	310:324,10O  !
3O	time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady	310:324,11O  !
3O	concerned in it deserved.  But at last your uncle was	310:324,12O  !
3O	forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use	310:324,13O  !
3O	to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the	310:324,14O  !
3O	probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain;	310:324,15O  !
3O	and I really believe your letter this morning gave him	310:324,16O  !
3O	great pleasure, because it required an explanation that	310:324,17O  !
3O	would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the	310:324,18O  !
3O	praise where it was due.  But, Lizzy, this must go no	310:324,19O  !
3O	farther than yourself, or Jane at most.  You know pretty	310:324,20O  !
3O	well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.	310:324,21O  !
3O	His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably	310:324,22O  !
3O	more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in	310:324,23O  !
3O	addition to her own settled upon \her\, and his commission	310:324,24O  !
3O	purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done by	310:324,25O  !
3O	him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing	310:324,26O  !
3O	to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration,	310:324,27O  !
3O	that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood,	310:324,28O  !
3O	and consequently that he had been received and noticed	310:324,29O  !
3O	as he was.  Perhaps there was some truth in \this\; though	310:324,30O  !
3O	I doubt whether \his\ reserve, or \anybody's\ reserve, can be	310:324,31O  !
3O	answerable for the event.  But in spite of all this fine	310:324,32O  !
3O	talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured,	310:324,33O  !
3O	that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not	310:324,34O  !
3O	given him credit for \another\ \interest\ in the affair.  When	310:324,35O  !
3O	all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends,	310:324,36O  !
3O	who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed	310:324,37O  !
3O	that he should be in London once more when the wedding	310:324,38O  !
3O	took place, and all money matters were then to receive	310:325, 1O  !
3O	the last finish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.	310:325, 2O  !
3O	It is a relation which you tell me is to give you	310:325, 3O  !
3O	great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any	310:325, 4O  !
3O	displeasure.  Lydia came to us; and Wickham had	310:325, 5O  !
3O	constant admission to the house.  \He\ was exactly what	310:325, 6O  !
3O	he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but	310:325, 7O  !
3O	I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with \her\	310:325, 8O  !
3O	behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived,	310:325, 9O  !
3O	by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on	310:325,10O  !
3O	coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore	310:325,11O  !
3O	what I now tell you, can give you no fresh pain.  I talked	310:325,12O  !
3O	to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to	310:325,13O  !
3O	her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the	310:325,14O  !
3O	unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she heard	310:325,15O  !
3O	me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.	310:325,16O  !
3O	I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected	310:325,17O  !
3O	my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had	310:325,18O  !
3O	patience with her.  Mr% Darcy was punctual in his return,	310:325,19O  !
3O	and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding.  He	310:325,20O  !
3O	dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again	310:325,21O  !
3O	on Wednesday or Thursday.  Will you be very angry with	310:325,22O  !
3O	me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying	310:325,23O  !
3O	(what I was never bold enough to say before how much	310:325,24O  !
3O	I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been	310:325,25O  !
3O	as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His understanding	310:325,26O  !
3O	and opinions all please me; he wants nothing	310:325,27O  !
3O	but a little more liveliness, and \that\, if he marry \prudently\,	310:325,28O  !
3O	his wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; ~ he	310:325,29O  !
3O	hardly ever mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the	310:325,30O  !
3O	fashion.  Pray forgive me, if I have been very presuming,	310:325,31O  !
3O	or at least do not punish me so far, as to exclude me from	310:325,32O  !
3O	P.  I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round	310:325,33O  !
3O	the park.  A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies,	310:325,34O  !
3O	would be the very thing.  But I must write no more.	310:325,35O  !
3O	The children have been wanting me this half hour.  Your's,	310:325,36O  !
3O	very sincerely,	310:325,37O  !
3O	"M% GARDINER."	310:325,38O  !
3V	"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear	310:327,16V  !
3V	sister?"	310:327,17V  !
3A	"You certainly do,"	310:327,18A  !
3A	"but	310:327,18A  !
3A	it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."	310:327,19A  !
3V	"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.  \We\ were always	310:327,21V  !
3V	good friends; and now we are better."	310:327,22V  !
3A	"True.  Are the others coming out?"	310:327,23A  !
3V	"I do not know.  Mrs% Bennet and Lydia are going in	310:327,24V  !
3V	the carriage to Meryton.  And so, my dear sister, I find	310:327,25V  !
3V	from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen	310:327,26V  !
3V	Pemberley."	310:327,27V  !
3V	"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe	310:327,29V  !
3V	it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my	310:327,30V  !
3V	way to Newcastle.  And you saw the old housekeeper,	310:327,31V  !
3V	I suppose?  Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of	310:327,32V  !
3V	me.  But of course she did not mention my name to you."	310:327,33V  !
3A	"Yes, she did."	310:327,34A  !
3V	"And what did she say?"	310:327,35V  !
3A	"That you were gone into the army, and she was	310:327,36A  !
3A	afraid had ~~ not turned out well.  At such a distance as	310:327,37A  !
3A	\that\, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."	310:327,39A  !
3V	"Certainly,"	310:328, 1V  !
3V	"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.  We	310:328, 4V  !
3V	passed each other several times.  I wonder what he can	310:328, 5V  !
3V	be doing there."	310:328, 6V  !
3A	"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,"	310:328, 7A  !
3A	"It must be something particular,	310:328, 8A  !
3A	to take him there at this time of year."	310:328, 9A  !
3V	"Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at	310:328,10V  !
3V	Lambton?  I thought I understood from the Gardiners	310:328,11V  !
3V	that you had."	310:328,12V  !
3A	"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."	310:328,13A  !
3V	"And do you like her?"	310:328,14V  !
3A	"Very much."	310:328,15A  !
3V	"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved	310:328,16V  !
3V	within this year or two.  When I last saw her, she	310:328,17V  !
3V	was not very promising.  I am very glad you like her.	310:328,18V  !
3V	I hope she will turn out well."	310:328,19V  !
3A	"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying	310:328,20A  !
3A	age."	310:328,21A  !
3V	"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"	310:328,22V  !
3A	"I do not recollect that we did."	310:328,23A  !
3V	"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to	310:328,24V  !
3V	have had.  A most delightful place| ~ Excellent Parsonage House|	310:328,25V  !
3V	It would have suited me in every respect."	310:328,26V  !
3A	"How should you have liked making sermons?"	310:328,27A  !
3V	"Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part	310:328,28V  !
3V	of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been	310:328,29V  !
3V	nothing.  One ought not to repine; ~ but, to be sure, it	310:328,30V  !
3V	would have been such a thing for me|  The quiet, the	310:328,31V  !
3V	retirement of such a life, would have answered all my	310:328,32V  !
3V	ideas of happiness|  But it was not to be.  Did you ever	310:328,33V  !
3V	hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in	310:328,34V  !
3V	Kent?"	310:328,35V  !
3A	"I \have\ heard from authority, which I thought \as\ \good\,	310:328,36A  !
3A	that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will	310:328,37A  !
3A	of the present patron."	310:328,38A  !
3V	"You have.  Yes, there was something in \that\; I told	310:329, 1V  !
3V	you so from the first, you may remember."	310:329, 2V  !
3A	"I \did\ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making	310:329, 3A  !
3A	was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at	310:329, 4A  !
3A	present; that you actually declared your resolution of	310:329, 5A  !
3A	never taking orders, and that the business had been	310:329, 6A  !
3A	compromised accordingly."	310:329, 7A  !
3V	"You did| and it was not wholly without foundation.	310:329, 8V  !
3V	You may remember what I told you on that point, when	310:329, 9V  !
3V	first we talked of it."	310:329,10V  !
3A	"Come, Mr% Wickham, we are brother and sister, you	310:329,15A  !
3A	know.  Do not let us quarrel about the past.  In future,	310:329,16A  !
3A	I hope we shall be always of one mind."	310:329,17A  !
3D	"Oh| my dear Lydia,"	311:330,11D  !
3D	"when shall we meet	311:330,11D  !
3D	again?"	311:330,12D  !
3H	"Oh, lord|  I don't know.  Not these two or three	311:330,13H  !
3H	years perhaps."	311:330,14H  !
3D	"Write to me very often, my dear."	311:330,15D  !
3H	"As often as I can.  But you know married women	311:330,16H  !
3H	have never much time for writing.  My sisters may write	311:330,17H  !
3H	to \me\.  They will have nothing else to do."	311:330,18H  !
3C	"He is as fine a fellow,"	311:330,22C  !
3C	"as ever I saw.  He simpers,	311:330,23C  !
3C	and smirks, and makes love to us all.  I am prodigiously	311:330,24C  !
3C	proud of him.  I defy even Sir William Lucas himself,	311:330,25C  !
3C	to produce a more valuable son-in-law."	311:330,26C  !
3D	"I often think,"	311:330,29D  !
3D	"that there is nothing so	311:330,29D  !
3D	bad as parting with one's friends.  One seems so forlorn	311:330,30D  !
3D	without them."	311:330,31D  !
3A	"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying	311:330,32A  !
3A	a daughter,"	311:330,33A  !
3A	"It must make you better	311:330,33A  !
3A	satisfied that your other four are single."	311:330,34A  !
3D	"It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because	311:331, 1D  !
3D	she is married; but only because her husband's regiment	311:331, 2D  !
3D	happens to be so far off.  If that had been nearer, she	311:331, 3D  !
3D	would not have gone so soon."	311:331, 4D  !
3D	"Well, well, and so Mr% Bingley is coming down, sister,"	311:331,14D  !
3D	"Well, so	311:331,15D  !
3D	much the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He	311:331,16D  !
3D	is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure \I\ never want	311:331,17D  !
3D	to see him again.  But, however, he is very welcome to	311:331,18D  !
3D	come to Netherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what	311:331,19D  !
3D	\may\ happen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know,	311:331,20D  !
3D	sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about	311:331,21D  !
3D	it.  And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	311:331,22D  !
3E	"I saw you look at me to day, Lizzy, when my aunt	311:331,35E  !
3E	told us of the present report; and I know I appeared	311:331,36E  !
3E	distressed.  But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.	311:331,37E  !
3E	I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that	311:331,38E  !
3E	I \should\ be looked at.  I do assure you, that the news does	311:332, 1E  !
3E	not affect me either with pleasure or pain.  I am glad	311:332, 2E  !
3E	of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see	311:332, 3E  !
3E	the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of \myself\, but I dread	311:332, 4E  !
3E	other people's remarks."	311:332, 5E  !
3D	"As soon as ever Mr% Bingley comes, my dear,"	311:332,25D  !
3D	"you will wait on him of course."	311:332,26D  !
3C	"No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year,	311:332,27C  !
3C	and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one	311:332,28C  !
3C	of my daughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will	311:332,29C  !
3C	not be sent on a fool's errand again."	311:332,30C  !
3C	"'Tis an etiquette I despise,"	311:332,34C  !
3C	"If he wants	311:332,34C  !
3C	our society, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.	311:332,35C  !
3C	I will not spend \my\ hours in running after my neighbours	311:332,36C  !
3C	every time they go away, and come back again."	311:332,37C  !
3D	"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude	311:332,38D  !
3D	if you do not wait on him.  But, however, that shan't	311:333, 1D  !
3D	prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.	311:333, 2D  !
3D	We must have Mrs% Long and the Gouldings soon.  That	311:333, 3D  !
3D	will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just	311:333, 4D  !
3D	room at the table for him."	311:333, 5D  !
3E	"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,"	311:333,11E  !
3E	"It would be nothing; I could see him	311:333,12E  !
3E	with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear	311:333,13E  !
3E	it thus perpetually talked of.  My mother means well;	311:333,14E  !
3E	but she does not know, no one can know how much	311:333,15E  !
3E	I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I be, when his	311:333,16E  !
3E	stay at Netherfield is over|"	311:333,17E  !
3A	"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,"	311:333,18A  !
3A	"but it is wholly out of my power.  You	311:333,19A  !
3A	must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching	311:333,20A  !
3A	patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have	311:333,21A  !
3A	always so much."	311:333,22A  !
3D	"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose;	311:334, 1D  !
3D	I am sure I do not know."	311:334, 2D  !
3D	"Good gracious|  Mr% Darcy| ~ and so it does I vow.	311:334, 6D  !
3D	Well, any friend of Mr% Bingley's will always be welcome	311:334, 7D  !
3D	here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very	311:334, 8D  !
3D	sight of him."	311:334, 9D  !
3A	"Let me first see how he behaves,"	311:335, 1A  !
3A	"it will	311:335, 1A  !
3A	then be early enough for expectation."	311:335, 2A  !
3A	"Could I expect it to be otherwise|"	311:336, 9A  !
3A	"Yet	311:336, 9A  !
3A	why did he come?"	311:336,10A  !
3D	"It is a long time, Mr% Bingley, since you went away,"	311:336,14D  !
3D	"I began to be afraid you would never come back	311:336,17D  !
3D	again.  People \did\ say, you meant to quit the place entirely	311:336,18D  !
3D	at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.	311:336,19D  !
3D	A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,	311:336,20D  !
3D	since you went away.  Miss Lucas is married and	311:336,21D  !
3D	settled.  And one of my own daughters.  I suppose you	311:336,22D  !
3D	have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the	311:336,23D  !
3D	papers.  It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;	311:336,24D  !
3D	though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only said,	311:336,25D  !
3D	""Lately, George Wickham Esq% to Miss Lydia Bennet,""	311:336,26D  !
3D	without there being a syllable said of her father, or the	311:336,27D  !
3D	place where she lived, or any thing.  It was my brother	311:336,28D  !
3D	Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came	311:336,29D  !
3D	to make such an awkward business of it.  Did you see it?"	311:336,30D  !
3D	"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter	311:336,34D  !
3D	well married,"	311:336,35D  !
3D	"but at the same	311:336,35D  !
3D	time, Mr% Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such	311:336,36D  !
3D	a way from me.  They are gone down to Newcastle, a place	311:336,37D  !
3D	quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay,	311:336,38D  !
3D	I do not know how long.  His regiment is there; for I	311:337, 1D  !
3D	suppose you have heard of his leaving the @@@@ shire, and	311:337, 2D  !
3D	of his being gone into the regulars.  Thank Heaven| he	311:337, 3D  !
3D	has \some\ friends, though perhaps not so many as he	311:337, 4D  !
3D	deserves."	311:337, 5D  !
3D	"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr% Bingley,"	311:337,13D  !
3D	"I beg you will come here, and shoot	311:337,14D  !
3D	as many as you please, on Mr% Bennet's manor.  I am	311:337,15D  !
3D	sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save	311:337,16D  !
3D	all the best of the covies for you."	311:337,17D  !
3D	"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr% Bingley,"	311:338, 8D  !
3D	"for when you went to town last winter, you	311:338, 9D  !
3D	promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you	311:338,10D  !
3D	returned.  I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you,	311:338,11D  !
3D	I was very much disappointed that you did not come back	311:338,12D  !
3D	and keep your engagement."	311:338,13D  !
3A	"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"	312:339, 5A  !
3A	"did he come at all?"	312:339, 6A  !
3A	"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle	312:339, 8A  !
3A	and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?	312:339, 9A  !
3A	If he fears me, why come hither?  If he no longer cares	312:339,10A  !
3A	for me, why silent?  Teazing, teazing, man|  I will think	312:339,11A  !
3A	no more about him."	312:339,12A  !
3E	"Now,"	312:339,17E  !
3E	"that this first meeting is over, I feel	312:339,17E  !
3E	perfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never	312:339,18E  !
3E	be embarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines	312:339,19E  !
3E	here on Tuesday.  It will then be publicly seen, that on	312:339,20E  !
3E	both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent	312:339,21E  !
3E	acquaintance."	312:339,22E  !
3A	"Yes, very indifferent indeed,"	312:339,23A  !
3A	"Oh, Jane, take care."	312:339,24A  !
3E	"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to	312:339,25E  !
3E	be in danger now."	312:339,26E  !
3A	"I think you are in very great danger of making him	312:339,27A  !
3A	as much in love with you as ever."	312:339,28A  !
3A	"If he does not come to me, \then\,"	312:341,11A  !
3A	"I shall	312:341,11A  !
3A	give him up for ever."	312:341,12A  !
3A	"Is your sister at Pemberley still"	312:341,36A  !
3B	"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."	312:341,37B  !
3A	"And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?"	312:341,38A  !
3B	"Mrs% Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone	312:342, 1B  !
3B	on to Scarborough, these three weeks."	312:342, 2B  !
3D	"Well girls,"	312:342,22D  !
3D	"What say you to the day?  I think every thing	312:342,23D  !
3D	has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The	312:342,24D  !
3D	dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison	312:342,25D  !
3D	was roasted to a turn ~ and everybody said, they never	312:342,26D  !
3D	saw so fat a haunch.  The soup was fifty times better	312:342,27D  !
3D	than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even	312:342,28D  !
3D	Mr% Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably	312:342,29D  !
3D	well done; and I suppose he has two or three French	312:342,30D  !
3D	cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look	312:342,31D  !
3D	in greater beauty.  Mrs% Long said so too, for I asked her	312:342,32D  !
3D	whether you did not.  And what do you think she said	312:342,33D  !
3D	besides? ""Ah| Mrs% Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield	312:342,34D  !
3D	at last.""  She did indeed.  I do think Mrs% Long is	312:342,35D  !
3D	as good a creature as ever lived ~ and her nieces are very	312:342,36D  !
3D	pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome:  I like	312:342,37D  !
3D	them prodigiously."	312:342,38D  !
3E	"It has been a very agreeable day,"	312:343, 8E  !
3E	"The party seemed so well selected, so	312:343, 9E  !
3E	suitable one with the other.  I hope we may often meet	312:343,10E  !
3E	again."	312:343,11E  !
3E	"Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect	312:343,13E  !
3E	me.  It mortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt	312:343,14E  !
3E	to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible	312:343,15E  !
3E	young man, without having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly	312:343,16E  !
3E	satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never	312:343,17E  !
3E	had any design of engaging my affection.  It is only that	312:343,18E  !
3E	he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a	312:343,19E  !
3E	stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man."	312:343,20E  !
3A	"You are very cruel,"	312:343,21A  !
3A	"you will not	312:343,21A  !
3A	let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."	312:343,22A  !
3E	"How hard it is in some cases to be believed|"	312:343,23E  !
3A	"And how impossible in others|"	312:343,24A  !
3E	"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel	312:343,25E  !
3E	more than I acknowledge?"	312:343,26E  !
3A	"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	312:343,27A  !
3A	We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what	312:343,28A  !
3A	is not worth knowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist	312:343,29A  !
3A	in indifference, do not make \me\ your confidante."	312:343,30A  !
3D	"Next time you call,"	313:344, 8D  !
3D	"I hope we shall be	313:344, 8D  !
3D	more lucky."	313:344, 9D  !
3D	"Can you come to-morrow?"	313:344,13D  !
3D	"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is	313:344,20D  !
3D	come ~ Mr% Bingley is come. ~ He is, indeed.  Make haste,	313:344,21D  !
3D	make haste.  Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this	313:344,22D  !
3D	moment, and help her on with her gown.  Never mind	313:344,23D  !
3D	Miss Lizzy's hair."	313:344,24D  !
3E	"We will be down as soon as we can,"	313:344,25E  !
3E	"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for	313:344,26E  !
3E	she went up stairs half an hour ago."	313:344,27E  !
3D	"Oh| hang Kitty| what has she to do with it?  Come	313:344,28D  !
3D	be quick, be quick|  where is your sash my dear?"	313:344,29D  !
3D	"Nothing child, nothing.  I did not wink at you."	313:345, 8D  !
3D	"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,"	313:345,12D  !
3D	"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."	313:345,17D  !
3D	"We may as well leave them by themselves you	313:345,19D  !
3D	know;"	313:345,20D  !
3D	"Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing room."	313:345,21D  !
3E	"'Tis too much|"	313:346,37E  !
3E	"by far too much.  I do	313:346,37E  !
3E	not deserve it.  Oh| why is not every body as happy?"	313:346,38E  !
3E	"I must go instantly to my mother;"	313:347, 6E  !
3E	"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate	313:347, 7E  !
3E	solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.	313:347, 8E  !
3E	He is gone to my father already.  Oh|  Lizzy, to know	313:347, 9E  !
3E	that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all	313:347,10E  !
3E	my dear family| how shall I bear so much happiness|"	313:347,11E  !
3A	"And this,"	313:347,19A  !
3A	"is the end of all his friend's	313:347,19A  !
3A	anxious circumspection| of all his sister's falsehood	313:347,20A  !
3A	and contrivance| the happiest, wisest, most reasonable	313:347,21A  !
3A	end|"	313:347,22A  !
3A	"With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a	313:347,28A  !
3A	moment I dare say."	313:347,29A  !
3C	"Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy	313:348,17C  !
3C	woman."	313:348,18C  !
3C	"You are a good girl;"	313:348,21C  !
3C	"and I have great	313:348,21C  !
3C	pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have	313:348,22C  !
3C	not a doubt of your doing very well together.  Your	313:348,23C  !
3C	tempers are by no means unlike.  You are each of you so	313:348,24C  !
3C	complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so	313:348,25C  !
3C	easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous,	313:348,26C  !
3C	that you will always exceed your income."	313:348,27C  !
3E	"I hope not so.  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in	313:348,28E  !
3E	money matters, would be unpardonable in \me\."	313:348,29E  !
3D	"Exceed their income|  My dear Mr% Bennet,"	313:348,30D  !
3D	"what are you talking of?  Why, he has four	313:348,31D  !
3D	or five thousand a-year, and very likely more."	313:348,32D  !
3D	"Oh| my dear, dear Jane, I am	313:348,33D  !
3D	so happy|  I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	313:348,34D  !
3D	I knew how it would be.  I always said it must be so,	313:348,35D  !
3D	at last.  I was sure you could not be so beautiful for	313:348,36D  !
3D	nothing|  I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when	313:348,37D  !
3D	he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how	313:348,38D  !
3D	likely it was that you should come together.  Oh| he is	313:349, 1D  !
3D	the handsomest young man that ever was seen|"	313:349, 2D  !
3E	"He has made me so happy,"	313:349,25E  !
3E	"by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my	313:349,26E  !
3E	being in town last spring|  I had not believed it	313:349,27E  !
3E	possible."	313:349,28E  !
3A	"I suspected as much,"	313:349,29A  !
3A	"But how	313:349,29A  !
3A	did he account for it?"	313:349,30A  !
3E	"It must have been his sister's doing.  They were	313:349,31E  !
3E	certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which	313:349,32E  !
3E	I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much	313:349,33E  !
3E	more advantageously in many respects.  But when they	313:349,34E  !
3E	see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with	313:349,35E  !
3E	me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on	313:349,36E  !
3E	good terms again; though we can never be what we once	313:349,37E  !
3E	were to each other."	313:349,38E  !
3A	"That is the most unforgiving speech,"	313:350, 1A  !
3A	"that I ever heard you utter.  Good girl|  It would vex	313:350, 2A  !
3A	me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's	313:350, 3A  !
3A	pretended regard."	313:350, 4A  !
3E	"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to	313:350, 5E  !
3E	town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but	313:350, 6E  !
3E	a persuasion of \my\ being indifferent, would have prevented	313:350, 7E  !
3E	his coming down again|"	313:350, 8E  !
3A	"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to	313:350, 9A  !
3A	the credit of his modesty."	313:350,10A  !
3E	"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever	313:350,18E  !
3E	existed|"	313:350,19E  !
3E	"Oh| Lizzy, why am I thus	313:350,19E  !
3E	singled from my family, and blessed above them all|	313:350,20E  !
3E	If I could but see \you\ as happy|  If there \were\ but such	313:350,21E  !
3E	another man for you|"	313:350,22E  !
3A	"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could	313:350,23A  !
3A	be so happy as you.  Till I have your disposition, your	313:350,24A  !
3A	goodness, I never can have your happiness.  No, no, let	313:350,25A  !
3A	me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good	313:350,26A  !
3A	luck, I may meet with another Mr% Collins in time."	313:350,27A  !
3L	"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady I suppose	314:351,32L  !
3L	is your mother."	314:351,33L  !
3L	"And \that\ I suppose is one of your sisters."	314:352, 2L  !
3D	"Yes, madam,"	314:352, 3D  !
3D	"She is my youngest girl but one.	314:352, 4D  !
3D	My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is	314:352, 5D  !
3D	some-where about the grounds, walking with a young man,	314:352, 6D  !
3D	who I believe will soon become a part of the family."	314:352, 7D  !
3L	"You have a very small park here,"	314:352, 8L  !
3D	"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady,	314:352,10D  !
3D	I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than	314:352,11D  !
3D	Sir William Lucas's."	314:352,12D  !
3L	"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for	314:352,13L  !
3L	the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."	314:352,14L  !
3D	"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship	314:352,17D  !
3D	whether you left Mr% and Mrs% Collins well."	314:352,18D  !
3L	"Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last."	314:352,19L  !
3L	"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of	314:352,28L  !
3L	a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be	314:352,29L  !
3L	glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your	314:352,30L  !
3L	company."	314:352,31L  !
3D	"Go, my dear,"	314:352,32D  !
3D	"and shew her	314:352,32D  !
3D	ladyship about the different walks.  I think she will be	314:352,33D  !
3D	pleased with the hermitage."	314:352,34D  !
3A	"How could I ever think her like her nephew?"	314:353, 9A  !
3L	"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the	314:353,13L  !
3L	reason of my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own	314:353,14L  !
3L	conscience, must tell you why I come."	314:353,15L  !
3A	"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been	314:353,17A  !
3A	at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."	314:353,18A  !
3L	"Miss Bennet,"	314:353,19L  !
3L	"you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.	314:353,20L  !
3L	But however insincere \you\ may choose to be, you shall	314:353,21L  !
3L	not find \me\ so.  My character has ever been celebrated	314:353,22L  !
3L	for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such	314:353,23L  !
3L	moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	314:353,24L  !
3L	A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days	314:353,25L  !
3L	ago.  I was told, that not only your sister was on the	314:353,26L  !
3L	point of being most advantageously married, but that \you\,	314:353,27L  !
3L	that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be	314:353,28L  !
3L	soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew,	314:353,29L  !
3L	Mr% Darcy.  Though I \know\ it must be a scandalous	314:353,30L  !
3L	falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as	314:353,31L  !
3L	to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved	314:353,32L  !
3L	on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments	314:353,33L  !
3L	known to you."	314:353,34L  !
3A	"If you believed it impossible to be true,"	314:353,35A  !
3A	"I wonder you	314:353,36A  !
3A	took the trouble of coming so far.  What could your	314:353,37A  !
3A	ladyship propose by it?"	314:353,38A  !
3L	"At once to insist upon having such a report universally	314:354, 1L  !
3L	contradicted."	314:354, 2L  !
3A	"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,"	314:354, 3A  !
3A	"will be rather a confirmation of	314:354, 4A  !
3A	it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."	314:354, 5A  !
3L	"If| do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has	314:354, 6L  !
3L	it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do	314:354, 7L  !
3L	you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"	314:354, 8L  !
3A	"I never heard that it was."	314:354, 9A  !
3L	"And can you likewise declare, that there is no \foundation\	314:354,10L  !
3L	for it?"	314:354,11L  !
3A	"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your	314:354,12A  !
3A	ladyship.  \You\ may ask questions, which \I\ shall not choose	314:353,13A  !
3A	to answer."	314:354,14A  !
3L	"This is not to be borne.  Miss Bennet, I insist on being	314:354,15L  !
3L	satisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of	314:354,16L  !
3L	marriage?"	314:354,17L  !
3A	"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	314:354,18A  !
3L	"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the	314:354,19L  !
3L	use of his reason.  But \your\ arts and allurements may,	314:354,20L  !
3L	in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what	314:354,21L  !
3L	he owes to himself and to all his family.  You may have	314:354,22L  !
3L	drawn him in."	314:354,23L  !
3A	"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."	314:354,24A  !
3L	"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not	314:354,25L  !
3L	been accustomed to such language as this.  I am almost	314:354,26L  !
3L	the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled	314:354,27L  !
3L	to know all his dearest concerns."	314:354,28L  !
3A	"But you are not entitled to know \mine\; nor will	314:354,29A  !
3A	such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."	314:354,30A  !
3L	"Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which	314:354,31L  !
3L	you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.	314:354,32L  !
3L	No, never.  Mr% Darcy is engaged to \my\ \daughter\. Now	314:354,33L  !
3L	what have you to say?"	314:354,34L  !
3A	"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason	314:354,35A  !
3A	to suppose he will make an offer to me."	314:354,36A  !
3L	"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	314:355, 1L  !
3L	From their infancy, they have been intended for each	314:355, 2L  !
3L	other.  It was the favourite wish of \his\ mother, as well	314:355, 3L  !
3L	as of her's.  While in their cradles, we planned the union:	314:355, 4L  !
3L	and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters	314:355, 5L  !
3L	would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented	314:355, 6L  !
3L	by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in	314:355, 7L  !
3L	the world, and wholly unallied to the family|  Do you	314:355, 8L  !
3L	pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?  To his tacit	314:355, 9L  !
3L	engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to every	314:355,10L  !
3L	feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard	314:355,11L  !
3L	me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for	314:355,12L  !
3L	his cousin?"	314:355,13L  !
3A	"Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that	314:355,14A  !
3A	to me?  If there is no other objection to my marrying your	314:355,15A  !
3A	nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing	314:355,16A  !
3A	that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.	314:355,17A  !
3A	You both did as much as you could, in planning	314:355,18A  !
3A	the marriage.  Its completion depended on others.	314:355,19A  !
3A	If Mr% Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined	314:355,20A  !
3A	to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?  And	314:355,21A  !
3A	if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"	314:355,22A  !
3L	"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest,	314:355,23L  !
3L	forbid it.  Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect	314:355,24L  !
3L	to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act	314:355,25L  !
3L	against the inclinations of all.  You will be censured,	314:355,26L  !
3L	slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	314:355,27L  !
3L	Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never	314:355,28L  !
3L	even be mentioned by any of us."	314:355,29L  !
3A	"These are heavy misfortunes,"	314:355,30A  !
3A	"But the wife of Mr% Darcy must have such extraordinary	314:355,31A  !
3A	sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation,	314:355,32A  !
3A	that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."	314:355,33A  !
3L	"Obstinate, headstrong girl|  I am ashamed of you|	314:355,34L  !
3L	Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last	314:355,35L  !
3L	spring?  Is nothing due to me on that score?	314:355,36L  !
3L	"Let us sit down.  You are to understand, Miss Bennet,	314:355,37L  !
3L	that I came here with the determined resolution of	314:355,38L  !
3L	carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.	314:356, 1L  !
3L	I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	314:356, 2L  !
3L	I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	314:356, 3L  !
3A	"\That\ will make your ladyship's situation at present	314:356, 4A  !
3A	more pitiable; but it will have no effect on \me\."	314:356, 5A  !
3L	"I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My	314:356, 6L  !
3L	daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.  They	314:356, 7L  !
3L	are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble	314:356, 8L  !
3L	line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable,	314:356, 9L  !
3L	and ancient, though untitled families.  Their fortune on	314:356,10L  !
3L	both sides is splendid.  They are destined for each other	314:356,11L  !
3L	by the voice of every member of their respective houses;	314:356,12L  !
3L	and what is to divide them?  The upstart pretensions of	314:356,13L  !
3L	a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.	314:356,14L  !
3L	Is this to be endured|  But it must not, shall not be.  If	314:356,15L  !
3L	you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish	314:356,16L  !
3L	to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up."	314:356,17L  !
3A	"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself	314:356,18A  !
3A	as quitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's	314:356,19A  !
3A	daughter; so far we are equal."	314:356,20A  !
3L	"True.  You \are\ a gentleman's daughter.  But who was	314:356,21L  !
3L	your mother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not	314:356,22L  !
3L	imagine me ignorant of their condition."	314:356,23L  !
3A	"Whatever my connections may be,"	314:356,24A  !
3A	"if your nephew does not object to them, they can be	314:356,25A  !
3A	nothing to you."	314:356,26A  !
3L	"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	314:356,27L  !
3A	"I am not."	314:356,31A  !
3L	"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an	314:356,33L  !
3L	engagement?"	314:356,34L  !
3A	"I will make no promise of the kind."	314:356,35A  !
3L	"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.  I expected	314:356,36L  !
3L	to find a more reasonable young woman.  But do not	314:356,37L  !
3L	deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.	314:356,38L  !
3L	I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance	314:357, 1L  !
3L	I require."	314:357, 2L  !
3A	"And I certainly \never\ shall give it.  I am not to be	314:357, 3A  !
3A	intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your	314:357, 4A  !
3A	ladyship wants Mr% Darcy to marry your daughter; but	314:357, 5A  !
3A	would my giving you the wished-for promise, make \their\	314:357, 6A  !
3A	marriage at all more probable?  Supposing him to be	314:357, 7A  !
3A	attached to me, would \my\ refusing to accept his hand,	314:357, 8A  !
3A	make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?  Allow me to	314:357, 9A  !
3A	say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you	314:357,10A  !
3A	have supported this extraordinary application, have been	314:357,11A  !
3A	as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.  You have	314:357,12A  !
3A	widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be	314:357,13A  !
3A	worked on by such persuasions as these.  How far your	314:357,14A  !
3A	nephew might approve of your interference in \his\ affairs,	314:357,15A  !
3A	I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern	314:357,16A  !
3A	yourself in mine.  I must beg, therefore, to be importuned	314:357,17A  !
3A	no farther on the subject."	314:357,18A  !
3L	"Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means	314:357,19L  !
3L	done.  To all the objections I have already urged, I have	314:357,20L  !
3L	still another to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars	314:357,21L  !
3L	of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.  I know	314:357,22L  !
3L	it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up	314:357,23L  !
3L	business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	314:357,24L  !
3L	And is \such\ a girl to be my nephew's sister?  Is \her\ husband,	314:357,25L  !
3L	is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?	314:357,26L  !
3L	Heaven and earth| ~ of what are you thinking?  Are the	314:357,27L  !
3L	shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"	314:357,28L  !
3A	"You can \now\ have nothing farther to say,"	314:357,29A  !
3A	"You have insulted me, in every possible	314:357,30A  !
3A	method.  I must beg to return to the house."	314:357,31A  !
3L	"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit	314:357,35L  !
3L	of my nephew|  Unfeeling, selfish girl|  Do you not consider	314:357,36L  !
3L	that a connection with you, must disgrace him in	314:357,37L  !
3L	the eyes of everybody?"	314:357,38L  !
3A	"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.  You	314:358, 1A  !
3A	know my sentiments."	314:358, 2A  !
3L	"You are then resolved to have him?"	314:358, 3L  !
3A	"I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act	314:358, 4A  !
3A	in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute	314:358, 5A  !
3A	my happiness, without reference to \you\, or to any person	314:358, 6A  !
3A	so wholly unconnected with me."	314:358, 7A  !
3L	"It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse	314:358, 8L  !
3L	to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You	314:358, 9L  !
3L	are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends,	314:358,10L  !
3L	and make him the contempt of the world."	314:358,11L  !
3A	"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,"	314:358,12A  !
3A	"have any possible claim on me, in the present	314:358,13A  !
3A	instance.  No principle of either, would be violated by	314:358,14A  !
3A	my marriage with Mr% Darcy.  And with regard to the	314:358,15A  !
3A	resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world,	314:358,16A  !
3A	if the former \were\ excited by his marrying me, it would	314:358,17A  !
3A	not give me one moment's concern ~ and the world in	314:358,18A  !
3A	general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."	314:358,19A  !
3L	"And this is your real opinion|  This is your final	314:358,20L  !
3L	resolve|  Very well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do	314:358,21L  !
3L	not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever	314:358,22L  !
3L	be gratified.  I came to try you.  I hoped to find you	314:358,23L  !
3L	reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."	314:358,24L  !
3L	"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments	314:358,28L  !
3L	to your mother.  You deserve no such attention.	314:358,29L  !
3L	I am most seriously displeased."	314:358,30L  !
3A	"She did not choose it,"	314:358,37A  !
3A	"she	314:358,37A  !
3A	would go."	314:358,38A  !
3D	"She is a very fine-looking woman| and her calling	314:359, 1D  !
3D	here was prodigiously civil| for she only came, I suppose,	314:359, 2D  !
3D	to tell us the Collinses were well.  She is on her road	314:359, 3D  !
3D	somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton,	314:359, 4D  !
3D	thought she might as well call on you.  I suppose she had	314:359, 5D  !
3D	nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"	314:359, 6D  !
3C	"Lizzy,"	315:361,30C  !
3C	"I was going to look for you; come	315:361,30C  !
3C	into my room."	315:361,31C  !
3C	"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished	315:362, 3C  !
3C	me exceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself,	315:362, 4C  !
3C	you ought to know its contents.  I did not know before,	315:362, 5C  !
3C	that I had \two\ daughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let	315:362, 6C  !
3C	me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	315:362, 7C  !
3C	"You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration	315:362,14C  !
3C	in such matters as these; but I think I may defy	315:362,15C  !
3C	even \your\ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.	315:362,16C  !
3C	This letter is from Mr% Collins."	315:362,17C  !
3A	"From Mr% Collins| and what can \he\ have to say?"	315:362,18A  !
3C	"Something very much to the purpose of course.  He	315:362,19C  !
3C	begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials	315:362,20C  !
3C	of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told,	315:362,21C  !
3C	by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall	315:362,22C  !
3C	not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says	315:362,23C  !
3C	on that point.  What relates to yourself, is as follows.	315:362,24C  !
3K	"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of	315:362,25K  !
3K	Mrs% Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now	315:362,26K  !
3K	add a short hint on the subject of another; of which	315:362,27K  !
3K	we have been advertised by the same authority.  Your	315:362,28K  !
3K	daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the	315:362,29K  !
3K	name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it,	315:362,30K  !
3K	and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably	315:362,31K  !
3K	looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages	315:362,32K  !
3K	in this land."	315:362,33K  !
3C	"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by	315:362,34C  !
3C	this?"	315:362,35C  !
3K	"This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar	315:362,35K  !
3K	way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most	315:362,36K  !
3K	desire, ~ splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive	315:362,37K  !
3K	patronage.  Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me	315:362,38K  !
3K	warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you	315:363, 1K  !
3K	may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's	315:363, 2K  !
3K	proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take	315:363, 3K  !
3K	immediate advantage of."	315:363, 4K  !
3C	"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?	315:363, 5C  !
3C	But now it comes out."	315:363, 6C  !
3K	"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.  We have	315:363, 7K  !
3K	reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh,	315:363, 8K  !
3K	does not look on the match with a friendly eye."	315:363, 9K  !
3C	"\Mr% Darcy\, you see, is the man|  Now, Lizzy, I think	315:363,10C  !
3C	I \have\ surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have	315:363,11C  !
3C	pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance,	315:363,12C  !
3C	whose name would have given the lie more effectually to	315:363,13C  !
3C	what they related?  Mr% Darcy, who never looks at any	315:363,14C  !
3C	woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never	315:363,15C  !
3C	looked at \you\ in his life|  It is admirable|"	315:363,16C  !
3C	"Are you not diverted?"	315:363,20C  !
3A	"Oh| yes.  Pray read on."	315:363,21A  !
3K	"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to	315:363,22K  !
3K	her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual	315:363,23K  !
3K	condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion;	315:363,24K  !
3K	when it became apparent, that on the score of some family	315:363,25K  !
3K	objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give	315:363,26K  !
3K	her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	315:363,27K  !
3K	I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of	315:363,28K  !
3K	this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be	315:363,29K  !
3K	aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into	315:363,30K  !
3K	a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	315:363,31K  !
3C	"Mr% Collins moreover adds,"	315:363,32C  !
3K	"I am truly rejoiced that	315:363,32K  !
3K	my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed	315:363,33K  !
3K	up, and am only concerned that their living together	315:363,34K  !
3K	before the marriage took place, should be so generally	315:363,35K  !
3K	known.  I must not, however, neglect the duties of my	315:363,36K  !
3K	station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at	315:363,37K  !
3K	hearing that you received the young couple into your	315:363,38K  !
3K	house as soon as they were married.  It was an encouragement	315:364, 1K  !
3K	of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn,	315:364, 2K  !
3K	I should very strenuously have opposed it.  You ought	315:364, 3K  !
3K	certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to	315:364, 4K  !
3K	admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be	315:364, 5K  !
3K	mentioned in your hearing."	315:364, 6K  !
3C	"\That\ is his notion of	315:364, 6C  !
3C	christian forgiveness|  The rest of his letter is only about	315:364, 7C  !
3C	his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a	315:364, 8C  !
3C	young olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look as if you did	315:364, 9C  !
3C	not enjoy it.  You are not going to be \Missish\, I hope,	315:364,10C  !
3C	and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For what	315:364,11C  !
3C	do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and	315:364,12C  !
3C	laugh at them in our turn?"	315:364,13C  !
3A	"Oh|"	315:364,14A  !
3A	"I am excessively diverted.	315:364,14A  !
3A	But it is so strange|"	315:364,15A  !
3C	"Yes ~ \that\ is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed	315:364,15C  !
3C	on any other man it would have been nothing; but \his\	315:364,16C  !
3C	perfect indifference, and \your\ pointed dislike, make it so	315:364,17C  !
3C	delightfully absurd|  Much as I abominate writing, I would	315:364,18C  !

3C	Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot	315:364,20C  !
3C	help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much	315:364,21C  !
3C	as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	315:364,22C  !
3C	And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this	315:364,23C  !
3C	report?  Did she call to refuse her consent?"	315:364,24C  !
3A	"Mr% Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the	316:365,24A  !
3A	sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how	316:365,25A  !
3A	much I may be wounding your's.  I can no longer help	316:365,26A  !
3A	thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor	316:365,27A  !
3A	sister.  Ever since I have known it, I have been most	316:365,28A  !
3A	anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.	316:365,29A  !
3A	Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have	316:365,30A  !
3A	merely my own gratitude to express."	316:365,31A  !
3B	"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,"	316:365,32B  !
3B	"that you have ever	316:365,33B  !
3B	been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have	316:365,34B  !
3B	given you uneasiness.  I did not think Mrs% Gardiner was	316:366, 1B  !
3B	so little to be trusted."	316:366, 2B  !
3A	"You must not blame my aunt.  Lydia's thoughtlessness	316:366, 3A  !

3A	in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew	316:366, 5A  !
3A	the particulars.  Let me thank you again and again, in	316:366, 6A  !
3A	the name of all my family, for that generous compassion	316:366, 7A  !
3A	which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so	316:366, 8A  !
3A	many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."	316:366, 9A  !
3B	"If you \will\ thank me,"	316:366,10B  !
3B	"let it be for yourself	316:366,10B  !
3B	alone.  That the wish of giving happiness to you, might	316:366,11B  !

3B	not attempt to deny.  But your \family\ owe me nothing.	316:366,13B  !
3B	Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of \you\."	316:366,14B  !

3B	your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely,	316:367,15B  !
3B	irrevocably decided against me, you would have	316:367,16B  !

3B	on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time,	316:367,24B  !

3B	manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now,	316:367,33B  !

3B	how they have tortured me; ~ though it was some	316:367,38B  !
3B	time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow	316:368, 1B  !
3B	their justice."	316:368, 2B  !
3A	"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make	316:368, 3A  !
3A	so strong an impression.  I had not the smallest idea of	316:368, 4A  !
3A	their being ever felt in such a way."	316:368, 5A  !
3B	"I can easily believe it.  You thought me then devoid	316:368, 6B  !
3B	of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.  The turn of	316:368, 7B  !
3B	your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that	316:368, 8B  !
3B	I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that	316:368, 9B  !
3B	would induce you to accept me."	316:368,10B  !
3A	"Oh| do not repeat what I then said.  These recollections	316:368,11A  !
3A	will not do at all.  I assure you, that I have long	316:368,12A  !
3A	been most heartily ashamed of it."	316:368,13A  !
3B	"Did it,"	316:368,14B  !
3B	"did	316:368,14B  !
3B	it \soon\ make you think better of me?  Did you, on reading	316:368,15B  !
3B	it, give any credit to its contents?"	316:368,16B  !
3B	"I knew,"	316:368,19B  !
3B	"that what I wrote must give you	316:368,19B  !
3B	pain, but it was necessary.  I hope you have destroyed	316:368,20B  !
3B	the letter.  There was one part especially, the opening	316:368,21B  !
3B	of it, which I should dread your having the power of	316:368,22B  !
3B	reading again.  I can remember some expressions which	316:368,23B  !
3B	might justly make you hate me."	316:368,24B  !
3A	"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it	316:368,25A  !
3A	essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though	316:368,26A  !
3A	we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely	316:368,27A  !
3A	unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed	316:368,28A  !
3A	as that implies."	316:368,29A  !
3B	"When I wrote that letter,"	316:368,30B  !
3B	"I believed	316:368,30B  !
3B	myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced	316:368,31B  !
3B	that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."	316:368,32B  !
3A	"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did	316:368,33A  !
3A	not end so.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no	316:368,34A  !
3A	more of the letter.  The feelings of the person who wrote,	316:368,35A  !
3A	and the person who received it, are now so widely different	316:368,36A  !
3A	from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance	316:368,37A  !
3A	attending it, ought to be forgotten.  You must	316:368,38A  !
3A	learn some of my philosophy.  Think only of the past as	316:369, 1A  !
3A	its remembrance gives you pleasure."	316:369, 2A  !
3B	"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the	316:369, 3B  !
3B	kind.  \Your\ retrospections must be so totally void of	316:369, 4B  !
3B	reproach, that the contentment arising from then, is not	316:369, 5B  !
3B	of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.	316:369, 6B  !
3B	But with \me\, it is not so.  Painful recollections will intrude,	316:369, 7B  !
3B	which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.  I have	316:369, 8B  !
3B	been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in	316:369, 9B  !
3B	principle.  As a child I was taught what was \right\, but	316:369,10B  !
3B	I was not taught to correct my temper.  I was given good	316:369,11B  !
3B	principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.	316:369,12B  !
3B	Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only \child\)	316:369,13B  !
3B	I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves,	316:369,14B  !
3B	(my father particularly, all that was benevolent and	316:369,15B  !
3B	amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be	316:369,16B  !
3B	selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own	316:369,17B  !
3B	family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world,	316:369,18B  !
3B	to \wish\ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth	316:369,19B  !
3B	compared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty;	316:369,20B  !
3B	and such I might still have been but for	316:369,21B  !
3B	you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth|  What do I not owe you|	316:369,22B  !
3B	You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most	316:369,23B  !
3B	advantageous.  By you, I was properly humbled.  I came	316:369,24B  !
3B	to you without a doubt of my reception.  You shewed	316:369,25B  !
3B	me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please	316:369,26B  !
3B	a woman worthy of being pleased."	316:369,27B  !
3A	"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"	316:369,28A  !
3B	"Indeed I had.  What will you think of my vanity?	316:369,29B  !
3B	I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."	316:369,30B  !
3A	"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally	316:369,31A  !
3A	I assure you.  I never meant to deceive you, but	316:369,32A  !
3A	my spirits might often lead me wrong.  How you must	316:369,33A  !
3A	have hated me after \that\ evening?"	316:369,34A  !
3B	"Hate you|  I was angry perhaps at first, but my	316:369,35B  !
3B	anger soon began to take a proper direction."	316:369,36B  !
3A	"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me;	316:369,37A  !
3A	when we met at Pemberley.  You blamed me for coming?"	316:369,38A  !
3B	"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."	316:370, 1B  !
3A	"Your surprise could not be greater than \mine\ in being	316:370, 2A  !
3A	noticed by you.  My conscience told me that I deserved	316:370, 3A  !
3A	no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not	316:370, 4A  !
3A	expect to receive \more\ than my due."	316:370, 5A  !
3B	"My object \then\,"	316:370, 6B  !
3B	"was to shew you,	316:370, 6B  !
3B	by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as	316:370, 7B  !
3B	to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness,	316:370, 8B  !
3B	to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see	316:370, 9B  !
3B	that your reproofs had been attended to.  How soon	316:370,10B  !
3B	any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell,	316:370,11B  !
3B	but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."	316:370,12B  !
3A	"What could become of Mr% Bingley and Jane|"	316:370,26A  !
3A	"I must ask whether you were surprised?"	316:370,30A  !
3B	"Not at all.  When I went away, I felt that it would	316:370,32B  !
3B	soon happen."	316:370,33B  !
3A	"That is to say, you had given your permission.  I	316:370,34A  !
3A	guessed as much."	316:370,35A  !
3B	"On the evening before my going to London,"	316:370,37B  !
3B	"I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to	316:370,38B  !
3B	have made long ago.  I told him of all that had occurred	316:371, 1B  !
3B	to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd	316:371, 2B  !
3B	and impertinent.  His surprise was great.  He had never	316:371, 3B  !
3B	had the slightest suspicion.  I told him, moreover, that	316:371, 4B  !
3B	I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done,	316:371, 5B  !
3B	that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could	316:371, 6B  !
3B	easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated,	316:317, 7B  !
3B	I felt no doubt of their happiness together."	316:371, 8B  !
3A	"Did you speak from your own observation,"	316:371,11A  !
3A	"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely	316:371,12A  !
3A	from my information last spring?"	316:371,13A  !
3B	"From the former.  I had narrowly observed her during	316:371,14B  !
3B	the two visits which I had lately made her here; and	316:371,15B  !
3B	I was convinced of her affection."	316:371,16B  !
3A	"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate	316:371,17A  !
3A	conviction to him."	316:371,18A  !
3B	"It did.  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.  His	316:371,19B  !
3B	diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment	316:371,20B  !
3B	in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made	316:371,21B  !
3B	every thing easy.  I was obliged to confess one thing,	316:371,22B  !
3B	which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.  I could	316:371,23B  !
3B	not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in	316:371,24B  !
3B	town three months last winter, that I had known it, and	316:371,25B  !
3B	purposely kept it from him.  He was angry.  But his	316:371,26B  !
3B	anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained	316:371,27B  !
3B	in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.  He has heartily	316:371,28B  !
3B	forgiven me now."	316:371,29B  !
3E	"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking	317:372, 1E  !
3E	to?"	317:372, 2E  !
3E	"You are joking, Lizzy.  This cannot be| ~ engaged to	317:372,24E  !
3E	Mr% Darcy|  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know	317:372,25E  !
3E	it to be impossible."	317:372,26E  !
3A	"This is a wretched beginning indeed|  My sole dependence	317:372,27A  !
3A	was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe	317:372,28A  !
3A	me, if you do not.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak	317:372,29A  !
3A	nothing but the truth.  He still loves me, and we are	317:372,30A  !
3A	engaged."	317:372,31A  !
3E	"Oh, Lizzy| it cannot	317:372,32E  !
3E	be.  I know how much you dislike him."	317:372,33E  !
3A	"You know nothing of the matter.  \That\ is all to be	317:373, 1A  !
3A	forgot.  Perhaps I did not always love him so well as	317:373, 2A  !
3A	I do now.  But in such cases as these, a good memory is	317:373, 3A  !
3A	unpardonable.  This is the last time I shall ever remember	317:373, 4A  !
3A	it myself."	317:373, 5A  !
3E	"Good Heaven| can it be really so|  Yet now I must	317:373, 8E  !
3E	believe you,"	317:373, 9E  !
3E	"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would ~	317:373, 9E  !
3E	I do congratulate you ~ but are you certain?  forgive the	317:373,10E  !
3E	question ~ are you quite certain that you can be happy	317:373,11E  !
3E	with him?"	317:373,12E  !
3A	"There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between	317:373,13A  !
3A	us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the	317:373,14A  !
3A	world.  But are you pleased, Jane?  Shall you like to have	317:373,15A  !
3A	such a brother?"	317:373,16A  !
3E	"Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley	317:373,17E  !
3E	or myself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked	317:373,18E  !
3E	of it as impossible.  And do you really love him quite well	317:373,19E  !
3E	enough?  Oh, Lizzy| do any thing rather than marry	317:373,20E  !
3E	without affection.  Are you quite sure that you feel what	317:373,21E  !
3E	you ought to do?"	317:373,22E  !
3A	"Oh, yes|  You will only think I feel \more\ than I ought	317:373,23A  !
3A	to do, when I tell you all."	317:373,24A  !
3E	"What do you mean?"	317:373,25E  !
3A	"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do	317:373,26A  !
3A	Bingley.  I am afraid you will be angry."	317:373,27A  !
3E	"My dearest sister, now \be\ serious.  I want to talk	317:373,28E  !
3E	very seriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to	317:373,29E  !
3E	know, without delay.  Will you tell me how long you have	317:373,30E  !
3E	loved him?"	317:373,31E  !
3A	"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly	317:373,32A  !
3A	know when it began.  But I believe I must date it from	317:373,33A  !
3A	my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."	317:373,34A  !
3E	"Now I am quite happy,"	317:374, 1E  !
3E	"for you will be as	317:374, 1E  !
3E	happy as myself.  I always had a value for him.  Were	317:374, 2E  !
3E	it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have	317:374, 3E  !
3E	esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your	317:374, 4E  !
3E	husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more	317:374, 5E  !
3E	dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very	317:374, 6E  !
3E	reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what	317:374, 7E  !
3E	passed at Pemberley and Lambton|  I owe all that	317:374, 8E  !
3E	I know of it, to another, not to you."	317:374, 9E  !
3D	"Good gracious|"	317:374,16D  !
3D	"if that disagreeable Mr% Darcy	317:374,17D  !
3D	is not coming here again with our dear Bingley|	317:374,18D  !
3D	What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always	317:374,19D  !
3D	coming here?  I had no notion but he would go a shooting,	317:374,20D  !
3D	or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.	317:374,21D  !
3D	What shall we do with him?  Lizzy, you must	317:374,22D  !
3D	walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's	317:374,23D  !
3D	way."	317:374,24D  !
3D	"I advise Mr% Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"	317:374,33D  !
3D	"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.	317:374,34D  !
3D	It is a nice long walk, and Mr% Darcy has never seen the	317:374,35D  !
3D	view."	317:374,36D  !
3D	"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced	317:375, 7D  !
3D	to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope	317:375, 8D  !
3D	you will not mind it:  it is all for Jane's sake, you know;	317:375, 9D  !
3D	and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just	317:375,10D  !
3D	now and then.  So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."	317:375,11D  !
3B	"Go to your father, he wants you in	317:375,36B  !
3B	the library."	317:375,37B  !
3C	"Lizzy,"	317:376, 2C  !
3C	"what are you doing?	317:376, 2C  !
3C	Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?	317:376, 3C  !
3C	Have not you always hated him?"	317:376, 4C  !
3C	"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.	317:376,11C  !
3C	He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes	317:376,12C  !
3C	and fine carriages than Jane.  But will they make you	317:376,13C  !
3C	happy?"	317:376,14C  !
3A	"Have you any other objections,"	317:376,15A  !
3A	"than	317:376,15A  !
3A	your belief of my indifference?"	317:376,16A  !
3C	"None at all.  We all know him to be proud, unpleasant	317:376,17C  !
3C	sort of a man; but this would be nothing if you	317:376,18C  !
3C	really liked him."	317:376,19C  !
3A	"I do, I do like him,"	317:376,20A  !
3A	"I love him.  Indeed he has no improper pride.  He is	317:376,21A  !
3A	perfectly amiable.  You do not know what he really is;	317:376,22A  !
3A	then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such	317:376,23A  !
3A	terms."	317:376,24A  !
3C	"Lizzy,"	317:376,25C  !
3C	"I have given him my consent.	317:376,25C  !
3C	He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never	317:376,26C  !
3C	dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	317:376,27C  !
3C	I now give it to \you\, if you are resolved on having him.	317:376,28C  !
3C	But let me advise you to think better of it.  I know your	317:376,29C  !
3C	disposition, Lizzy.  I know that you could be neither	317:376,30C  !
3C	happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your	317:376,31C  !
3C	husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.	317:376,32C  !
3C	Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger	317:376,33C  !
3C	in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely escape discredit	317:376,34C  !
3C	and misery.  My child, let me not have the grief	317:376,35C  !
3C	of seeing \you\ unable to respect your partner in life.  You	317:376,36C  !
3C	know not what you are about."	317:376,37C  !
3C	"Well, my dear,"	317:377, 9C  !
3C	"I have no more to say.  If this be the case, he deserves	317:377,10C  !
3C	you.  I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to	317:377,11C  !
3C	any one less worthy."	317:377,12C  !
3C	"This is an evening of wonders, indeed|  And so,	317:377,16C  !
3C	Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the	317:377,17C  !
3C	money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission|	317:377,18C  !
3C	So much the better.  It will save me a world	317:377,19C  !
3C	of trouble and economy.  Had it been your uncle's doing,	317:377,20C  !
3C	I must and \would\ have paid him; but these violent young	317:377,21C  !
3C	lovers carry every thing their own way.  I shall offer to	317:377,22C  !
3C	pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his	317:377,23C  !
3C	love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	317:377,24C  !
3C	"If any young men come	317:377,28C  !
3C	for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."	317:377,29C  !
3D	"Good gracious|  Lord bless me| only think| dear	317:378,10D  !

3D	"My dearest child,"	317:378,27D  !
3D	"I can think of nothing	317:378,27D  !
3D	else|  Ten thousand a year, and very likely more|  'Tis	317:378,28D  !
3D	as good as a Lord|  And a special licence.  You must and	317:378,29D  !
3D	shall be married by a special licence.  But my dearest	317:378,30D  !
3D	love, tell me what dish Mr% Darcy is particularly fond of,	317:378,31D  !
3D	that I may have it to-morrow."	317:378,32D  !
3C	"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,"	317:379, 9C  !
3C	"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall	317:379,10C  !
3C	like \your\ husband quite as well as Jane's."	317:379,11C  !
3A	"How could you begin?"	318:380, 3A  !
3A	"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you	318:380, 4A  !
3A	had once made a beginning; but what could set you off	318:380, 5A  !
3A	in the first place?"	318:380, 6A  !
3B	"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or	318:380, 7B  !
3B	the words, which laid the foundation.  It is too long ago.	318:380, 8B  !
3B	I was in the middle before I knew that I \had\ begun."	318:380, 9B  !
3A	"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my	318:380,10A  !
3A	manners ~ my behaviour to \you\ was at least always	318:380,11A  !
3A	bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without	318:380,12A  !
3A	rather wishing to give you pain than not.  Now be	318:380,13A  !
3A	sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"	318:380,14A  !
3B	"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."	318:380,15B  !
3A	"You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was	318:380,16A  !
3A	very little less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility,	318:380,17A  !
3A	of deference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted	318:380,18A  !
3A	with the women who were always speaking and looking,	318:380,19A  !
3A	and thinking for \your\ approbation alone.  I roused, and	318:380,20A  !
3A	interested you, because I was so unlike \them\.  Had you	318:380,21A  !
3A	not been really amiable you would have hated me for it;	318:380,22A  !
3A	but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself,	318:380,23A  !
3A	your feelings were always noble and just; and in your	318:380,24A  !
3A	heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously	318:380,25A  !
3A	courted you.  There ~ I have saved you the trouble	318:380,26A  !
3A	of accounting for it; and really, all things considered,	318:380,27A  !
3A	I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be sure, you	318:380,28A  !
3A	knew no actual good of me ~ but nobody thinks of \that\	318:380,29A  !
3A	when they fall in love."	318:380,30A  !
3B	"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to	318:380,31B  !
3B	Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?"	318:380,32B  !
3A	"Dearest Jane| who could have done less for her?	318:381, 1A  !
3A	But make a virtue of it by all means.  My good qualities	318:381, 2A  !
3A	are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them	318:381, 3A  !
3A	as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to	318:381, 4A  !
3A	find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often	318:381, 5A  !
3A	as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what	318:381, 6A  !
3A	made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.  What	318:381, 7A  !
3A	made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards	318:381, 8A  !
3A	dined here?  Why, especially, when you called, did	318:381, 9A  !
3A	you look as if you did not care about me?"	318:381,10A  !
3B	"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no	318:381,11B  !
3B	encouragement."	318:381,12B  !
3A	"But I was embarrassed."	318:381,13A  !
3B	"And so was I."	318:381,14B  !
3A	"You might have talked to me more when you came	318:381,15A  !
3A	to dinner."	318:381,16A  !
3B	"A man who had felt less, might."	318:381,17B  !
3A	"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable	318:381,18A  !
3A	answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to	318:381,19A  !
3A	admit it|  But I wonder how long you \would\ have gone	318:381,20A  !
3A	on, if you had been left to yourself.  I wonder when you	318:381,21A  !
3A	\would\ have spoken, if I had not asked you|  My resolution	318:381,22A  !
3A	of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly	318:381,23A  !
3A	great effect.  \Too\ \much\, I am afraid; for what becomes	318:381,24A  !
3A	of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of	318:381,25A  !
3A	promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?	318:381,26A  !
3A	This will never do."	318:381,27A  !
3B	"You need not distress yourself.  The moral will be	318:381,28B  !
3B	perfectly fair.  Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours	318:381,29B  !
3B	to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.	318:381,30B  !
3B	I am not indebted for my present happiness to your	318:381,31B  !
3B	eager desire of expressing your gratitude.  I was not in	318:381,32B  !
3B	a humour to wait for any opening of your's.  My aunt's	318:381,33B  !
3B	intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at	318:381,34B  !
3B	once to know every thing."	318:381,35B  !
3A	"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought	318:381,36A  !
3A	to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.  But tell	318:381,37A  !
3A	me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?  Was	318:381,38A  !
3A	it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?  or	318:382, 1A  !
3A	had you intended any more serious consequence?"	318:382, 2A  !
3B	"My real purpose was to see \you\, and to judge, if I could,	318:382, 3B  !
3B	whether I might ever hope to make you love me.  My	318:382, 4B  !
3B	avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see	318:382, 5B  !
3B	whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she	318:382, 6B  !
3B	were, to make the confession to him which I have since	318:382, 7B  !
3B	made."	318:382, 8B  !
3A	"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine,	318:382, 9A  !
3A	what is to befall her?"	318:382,10A  !
3B	"I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.	318:382,11B  !
3B	But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet	318:382,12B  !
3B	of paper, it shall be done directly."	318:382,13B  !
3A	"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit	318:382,14A  !
3A	by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as	318:382,15A  !
3A	another young lady once did.  But I have an aunt, too,	318:382,16A  !
3A	who must not be longer neglected."	318:382,17A  !
3A	"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as	318:382,26A  !
3A	I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory,	318:382,27A  !
3A	detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too	318:382,28A  !
3A	cross to write.  You supposed more than really existed.	318:382,29A  !
3A	But \now\ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to	318:382,30A  !
3A	your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible	318:382,31A  !
3A	flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe	318:382,32A  !
3A	me actually married, you cannot greatly err.  You must	318:382,33A  !
3A	write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more	318:382,34A  !
3A	than you did in your last.  I thank you, again and again,	318:382,35A  !
3A	for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly as	318:382,36A  !
3A	to wish it|  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We	318:382,37A  !
3A	will go round the Park every day.  I am the happiest	318:382,38A  !
3A	creature in the world.  Perhaps other people have said	318:383, 1A  !
3A	so before, but not one with such justice.  I am happier	318:383, 2A  !
3A	even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.  Mr% Darcy	318:383, 3A  !
3A	sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from	318:383, 4A  !
3A	me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	318:383, 5A  !
3A	Your's, &c%"	318:383, 6A  !
3C	"DEAR SIR,	318:383,12C  !
3C	"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	318:383,13C  !
3C	Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr% Darcy.  Console	318:383,14C  !
3C	Lady Catherine as well as you can.  But, if I were you,	318:383,15C  !
3C	I would stand by the nephew.  He has more to give.	318:383,16C  !
3C	"Your's sincerely, &c%"	318:383,17C  !
3H	"MY DEAR LIZZY,	319:386,25H  !
3H	"I wish you joy.  If you love Mr% Darcy half as well	319:386,26H  !
3H	as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy.	319:386,27H  !
3H	It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you	319:386,28H  !
3H	have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.  I am	319:386,29H  !
3H	sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and	319:386,30H  !
3H	I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live	319:386,31H  !
3H	upon without some help.  Any place would do, of about	319:386,32H  !
3H	three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not	319:386,33H  !
3H	speak to Mr% Darcy about it, if you had rather not.	319:386,34H  !
3H	"Your's, &c%"	319:386,35H  !
4J	"What	101:  5,30J  !
4J	if they were among them to undertake the care of her	101:  5,31J  !
4J	eldest daughter, a girl now nine years old, of an age to	101:  5,32J  !
4J	require more attention than her poor mother could possibly	101:  5,33J  !
4J	give? The trouble and expense of it to them,	101:  5,34J  !
4J	would be nothing compared with the benevolence of the	101:  5,35J  !
4J	action."	101:  5,36J  !
4F	"I	101:  5,36F  !
4F	think we cannot do better,"	101:  5,37F  !
4F	"let us send for	101:  5,37F  !
4F	the child."	101:  5,38F  !
4J	"My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you,	101:  6,10J  !
4J	and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your	101:  6,11J  !
4J	notions, which indeed are quite of a piece with your	101:  6,12J  !
4J	general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the	101:  6,13J  !
4J	main as to the propriety of doing every thing one could	101:  6,14J  !
4J	by way of providing for a child one had in a manner	101:  6,15J  !
4J	taken into one's own hands; and I am sure I should	101:  6,16J  !
4J	be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon	101:  6,17J  !
4J	such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who	101:  6,18J  !
4J	should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to	101:  6,19J  !
4J	bestow, but the children of my sisters? ~ and I am sure	101:  6,20J  !
4J	Mr% Norris is too just ~ but you know I am a woman of	101:  6,21J  !
4J	few words and professions. Do not let us be frightened	101:  6,22J  !
4J	from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education,	101:  6,23J  !
4J	and introduce her properly into the world, and ten to	101:  6,24J  !
4J	one but she has the means of settling well, without farther	101:  6,25J  !
4J	expense to any body. A niece of our's, Sir Thomas, I may	101:  6,26J  !
4J	say, or, at least of \your's\, would not grow up in this	101:  6,27J  !
4J	neighbourhood without many advantages. I don't say	101:  6,28J  !
4J	she would be so handsome as her cousins. I dare say	101:  6,29J  !
4J	she would not; but she would be introduced into the	101:  6,30J  !
4J	society of this country under such very favourable circumstances	101:  6,31J  !
4J	as, in all human probability, would get her	101:  6,32J  !
4J	a creditable establishment. You are thinking of your	101:  6,33J  !
4J	sons ~ but do not you know that of all things upon earth	101:  6,34J  !
4J	\that\ is the least likely to happen; brought up, as they	101:  6,35J  !
4J	would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It	101:  6,36J  !
4J	is morally impossible. I never knew an instance of it.	101:  6,37J  !
4J	It is, in fact, the only sure way of providing against the	101:  6,38J  !
4J	connection. Suppose her a pretty girl, and seen by Tom	101:  7, 1J  !
4J	or Edmund for the first time seven years hence, and	101:  7, 2J  !
4J	I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of	101:  7, 3J  !
4J	her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from	101:  7, 4J  !
4J	us all in poverty and neglect, would be enough to make	101:  7, 5J  !
4J	either of the dear sweet-tempered boys in love with her.	101:  7, 6J  !
4J	But breed her up with them from this time, and suppose	101:  7, 7J  !
4J	her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will	101:  7, 8J  !
4J	never be more to either than a sister."	101:  7, 9J  !
4E	"There is a great deal of truth in what you say,"	101:  7,10E  !
4E	"and far be it from me to throw	101:  7,11E  !
4E	any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which	101:  7,12E  !
4E	would be so consistent with the relative situations of	101:  7,13E  !
4E	each. I only meant to observe, that it ought not to be	101:  7,14E  !
4E	lightly engaged in, and that to make it really serviceable	101:  7,15E  !
4E	to Mrs% Price, and creditable to ourselves, we must secure	101:  7,16E  !
4E	to the child, or consider ourselves engaged to secure to	101:  7,17E  !
4E	her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision	101:  7,18E  !
4E	of a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer	101:  7,19E  !
4E	as you are so sanguine in expecting."	101:  7,20E  !
4J	"I thoroughly understand you,"	101:  7,21J  !
4J	"you are every thing that is generous and considerate,	101:  7,22J  !
4J	and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point.	101:  7,23J  !
4J	Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready	101:  7,24J  !
4J	enough to do for the good of those I love; and, though	101:  7,25J  !
4J	I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part	101:  7,26J  !
4J	of the regard I bear your own dear children, nor consider	101:  7,27J  !
4J	her, in any respect, so much my own, I should hate	101:  7,28J  !
4J	myself if I were capable of neglecting her. Is not she	101:  7,29J  !
4J	a sister's child? and could I bear to see her want, while	101:  7,30J  !
4J	I had a bit of bread to give her? My dear Sir Thomas,	101:  7,31J  !
4J	with all my faults I have a warm heart: and, poor as	101:  7,32J  !
4J	I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of life,	101:  7,33J  !
4J	than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against	101:  7,34J  !
4J	it, I will write to my poor sister to-morrow, and make	101:  7,35J  !
4J	the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled, \I\ will	101:  7,36J  !
4J	engage to get the child to Mansfield; \you\ shall have no	101:  7,37J  !
4J	trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never	101:  7,38J  !
4J	regard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and	101:  8, 1J  !
4J	she may have a bed at her cousin, the sadler's, and the	101:  8, 2J  !
4J	child be appointed to meet her there. They may easily	101:  8, 3J  !
4J	get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach, under	101:  8, 4J  !
4J	the care of any creditable person that may chance to be	101:  8, 5J  !
4J	going. I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman's	101:  8, 6J  !
4J	wife or other going up."	101:  8, 7J  !
4F	"Where shall the child come to	101:  9, 5F  !
4F	first, sister, to you or to us?"	101:  9, 6F  !
4F	"Then she had better come to us,"	101:  9,23F  !
4E	"Yes, let her home be in	101:  9,25E  !
4E	this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her,	101:  9,26E  !
4E	and she will at least have the advantage of companions	101:  9,27E  !
4E	of her own age, and of a regular instructress."	101:  9,28E  !
4J	"Very true,"	101:  9,29J  !
4J	"which are both very	101:  9,29J  !
4J	important considerations: and it will be just the same	101:  9,30J  !
4J	to Miss Lee, whether she has three girls to teach, or only	101:  9,31J  !
4J	two ~ there can be no difference. I only wish I could be	101:  9,32J  !
4J	more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I am	101:  9,33J  !
4J	not one of those that spare their own trouble; and	101:  9,34J  !
4J	Nanny shall fetch her, however it may put me to inconvenience	101:  9,35J  !
4J	to have my chief counsellor away for three days.	101:  9,36J  !
4J	I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the little white	101:  9,37J  !
4J	attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best	101:  9,38J  !
4J	place for her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the	101: 10, 1J  !
4J	girls, and close by the housemaids, who could either of	101: 10, 2J  !
4J	them help dress her you know, and take care of her	101: 10, 3J  !
4J	clothes, for I suppose you would not think it fair to	101: 10, 4J  !
4J	expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others. Indeed,	101: 10, 5J  !
4J	I do not see that you could possibly place her any where	101: 10, 6J  !
4J	else."	101: 10, 7J  !
4J	"I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,"	101: 10, 9J  !
4J	"and be sensible of her uncommon good	101: 10,10J  !
4J	fortune in having such friends."	101: 10,11J  !
4E	"Should her disposition be really bad,"	101: 10,12E  !
4E	"we must not, for our own children's sake, continue her	101: 10,13E  !
4E	in the family; but there is no reason to expect so great	101: 10,14E  !
4E	an evil. We shall probably see much to wish altered in	101: 10,15E  !
4E	her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some	101: 10,16E  !
4E	meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of	101: 10,17E  !
4E	manner; but these are not incurable faults ~ nor, I trust,	101: 10,18E  !
4E	can they be dangerous for her associates. Had my	101: 10,19E  !
4E	daughters been \younger\ than herself, I should have considered	101: 10,20E  !
4E	the introduction of such a companion, as a matter	101: 10,21E  !
4E	of very serious moment; but as it is, I hope there can	101: 10,22E  !
4E	be nothing to fear for \them\, and every thing to hope for	101: 10,23E  !
4E	\her\, from the association."	101: 10,24E  !
4J	"That is exactly what I think,"	101: 10,25J  !
4J	"and what I was saying to my husband this morning.	101: 10,26J  !
4J	It will be an education for the child said I, only being	101: 10,27J  !
4J	with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her nothing, she	101: 10,28J  !
4J	would learn to be good and clever from \them\."	101: 10,29J  !
4F	"I hope she will not tease my poor pug,"	101: 10,30F  !
4F	"I have but just got Julia to leave it alone."	101: 10,31F  !
4E	"There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs% Norris,"	101: 10,32E  !
4E	"as to the distinction proper to be	101: 10,33E  !
4E	made between the girls as they grow up; how to preserve	101: 10,34E  !
4E	in the minds of my \daughters\ the consciousness of what	101: 10,35E  !
4E	they are, without making them think too lowly of their	101: 10,36E  !
4E	cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far,	101: 10,37E  !
4E	to make her remember that she is not a \Miss Bertram\.	101: 10,38E  !
4E	I should wish to see them very good friends, and would,	101: 11, 1E  !
4E	on no account, authorize in my girls the smallest degree	101: 11, 2E  !
4E	of arrogance towards their relation; but still they cannot	101: 11, 3E  !
4E	be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations,	101: 11, 4E  !
4E	will always be different. It is a point of great delicacy,	101: 11, 5E  !
4E	and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly	101: 11, 6E  !
4E	the right line of conduct."	101: 11, 7E  !
4J	"This is not a very promising beginning,"	102: 13,32J  !
4J	"After all that	102: 13,33J  !
4J	I said to her as we came along, I thought she would have	102: 13,34J  !
4J	behaved better; I told her how much might depend upon	102: 13,35J  !
4J	her acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not	102: 13,36J  !
4J	be a little sulkiness of temper ~ her poor mother had	102: 13,37J  !
4J	a good deal; but we must make allowances for such	102: 13,38J  !
4J	a child ~ and I do not know that her being sorry to leave	102: 14, 1J  !
4J	her home is really against her, for, with all its faults, it	102: 14, 2J  !
4J	\was\ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much	102: 14, 3J  !
4J	she has changed for the better; but then there is moderation	102: 14, 4J  !
4J	in all things."	102: 14, 5J  !
4B	"My dear little cousin,"	102: 15,12B  !
4B	"what can be the matter?"	102: 15,13B  !
4B	"Was she ill? or was any body angry with	102: 15,16B  !
4B	her? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or	102: 15,17B  !
4B	was she puzzled about any thing in her lesson that he	102: 15,18B  !
4B	could explain? Did she, in short, want any thing he	102: 15,19B  !
4B	could possibly get her, or do for her?"	102: 15,20B  !
4A	"no, no ~ not at	102: 15,21A  !
4A	all ~ no, thank you;"	102: 15,22A  !
4B	"You are sorry to leave Mamma, my dear little Fanny,"	102: 15,26B  !
4B	"which shows you to be a very good girl; but	102: 15,27B  !
4B	you must remember that you are with relations and	102: 15,28B  !
4B	friends, who all love you, and wish to make you happy.	102: 15,29B  !
4B	Let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all	102: 15,30B  !
4B	about your brothers and sisters."	102: 15,31B  !
4A	"William did not like she should come away ~ he had	102: 16, 1A  !
4A	told her he should miss her very much indeed."	102: 16, 2A  !
4B	"But	102: 16, 2B  !
4B	William will write to you, I dare say."	102: 16, 3B  !
4A	"Yes, he had	102: 16, 3A  !
4A	promised he would, but he had told \her\ to write first."	102: 16, 4A  !
4B	"And when shall you do it?"	102: 16, 5B  !
4A	"she did not know; she had not	102: 16, 6A  !
4A	any paper."	102: 16, 7A  !
4B	"If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with	102: 16, 8B  !
4B	paper and every other material, and you may write your	102: 16, 9B  !
4B	letter whenever you choose. Would it make you happy	102: 16,10B  !
4B	to write to William?"	102: 16,11B  !
4A	"Yes, very."	102: 16,12A  !
4B	"Then let it be done now. Come with me into the	102: 16,13B  !
4B	breakfast room, we shall find every thing there, and be	102: 16,14B  !
4B	sure of having the room to ourselves."	102: 16,15B  !
4A	"But cousin ~ will it go to the post?"	102: 16,16A  !
4B	"Yes, depend upon me it shall; it shall go with the	102: 16,17B  !
4B	other letters; and as your uncle will frank it, it will cost	102: 16,18B  !
4B	William nothing."	102: 16,19B  !
4A	"My uncle|"	102: 16,20A  !
4B	"Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it	102: 16,21B  !
4B	to my father to frank."	102: 16,22B  !
4J	"My dear,"	102: 18,21J  !
4J	"it	102: 18,21J  !
4J	is very bad, but you must not expect every body to be	102: 18,22J  !
4J	as forward and quick at learning as yourself."	102: 18,23J  !
4J	"Very true, indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with	102: 19, 3J  !
4J	wonderful memories, and your poor cousin has probably	102: 19, 4J  !
4J	none at all. There is a vast deal of difference in memories,	102: 19, 5J  !
4J	as well as in every thing else, and therefore you must	102: 19, 6J  !
4J	make allowance for your cousin, and pity her deficiency.	102: 19, 7J  !
4J	And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever	102: 19, 8J  !
4J	yourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as	102: 19, 9J  !
4J	you know already, there is a great deal more for you to	102: 19,10J  !
4J	learn."	102: 19,11J  !
4J	"To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and	102: 19,16J  !
4J	shows a great want of genius and emulation. But all	102: 19,17J  !
4J	things considered, I do not know whether it is not as	102: 19,18J  !
4J	well that it should be so, for, though you know (owing	102: 19,19J  !
4J	to me) your papa and mamma are so good as to bring	102: 19,20J  !
4J	her up with you, it is not at all necessary that she should	102: 19,21J  !
4J	be as accomplished as you are; ~ on the contrary, it is	102: 19,22J  !
4J	much more desirable that there should be a difference."	102: 19,23J  !
4F	"she	102: 20, 8F  !
4F	could only say it was very unlucky, but some people	102: 20, 9F  !
4F	\were\ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains; she did	102: 20,10F  !
4F	not know what else was to be done; and except her	102: 20,11F  !
4F	being so dull, she must add, she saw no harm in the poor	102: 20,12F  !
4F	little thing ~ and always found her very handy and quick	102: 20,13F  !
4F	in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted."	102: 20,14F  !
4E	"I blush for you, Tom,"	103: 23,24E  !
4E	"I blush for the expedient which I am driven	103: 23,25E  !
4E	on, and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on	103: 23,26E  !
4E	the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten, twenty,	103: 23,27E  !
4E	thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income	103: 23,28E  !
4E	which ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power,	103: 23,29E  !
4E	or in your's (I hope it will), to procure him better	103: 23,30E  !
4E	preferment;	103: 23,30E  !
4E	but it must not be forgotten, that no benefit of	103: 23,31E  !
4E	that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on	103: 23,32E  !
4E	us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent for	103: 24, 1E  !
4E	the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego	103: 24, 2E  !
4E	through the urgency of your debts."	103: 24, 3E  !
4G	"no, he was a short-neck'd, apoplectic sort	103: 24,15G  !
4G	of fellow, and, plied well with good things, would soon	103: 24,16G  !
4G	pop off."	103: 24,17G  !
4F	"So, Fanny, you are	103: 24,36F  !
4F	going to leave us, and live with my sister. How shall	103: 24,37F  !
4F	you like it?"	103: 24,38F  !
4A	"Going to leave you?"	103: 25, 2A  !
4F	"Yes, my dear, why should you be astonished? You	103: 25, 3F  !
4F	have been five years with us, and my sister always meant	103: 25, 4F  !
4F	to take you when Mr% Norris died. But you must come	103: 25, 5F  !
4F	up and tack on my patterns all the same."	103: 25, 6F  !
4A	"I shall be very sorry to go away,"	103: 25,10A  !
4F	"Yes, I dare say you will; \that's\ natural enough.	103: 25,12F  !
4F	I suppose you have had as little to vex you, since you	103: 25,13F  !
4F	came into this house, as any creature in the world."	103: 25,14F  !
4A	"I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,"	103: 25,15A  !
4F	"No, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you	103: 25,17F  !
4F	a very good girl."	103: 25,18F  !
4A	"And am I never to live here again?"	103: 25,19A  !
4F	"Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable	103: 25,20F  !
4F	home. It can make very little difference to you, whether	103: 25,21F  !
4F	you are in one house or the other."	103: 25,22F  !
4A	"Cousin,"	103: 25,28A  !
4A	"something is going to happen	103: 25,28A  !
4A	which I do not like at all; and though you have often	103: 25,29A  !
4A	persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked	103: 25,30A  !
4A	at first, you will not be able to do it now. I am	103: 25,31A  !
4A	going to live entirely with my aunt Norris."	103: 25,32A  !
4B	"Indeed|"	103: 25,33B  !
4A	"Yes, my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is	103: 25,34A  !
4A	quite settled. I am to leave Mansfield Park, and go to the	103: 25,35A  !
4A	White house, I suppose, as soon as she is removed there."	103: 25,36A  !
4B	"Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to	103: 25,37B  !
4B	you, I should call it an excellent one."	103: 25,38B  !
4A	"Oh| Cousin|"	103: 26, 1A  !
4B	"It has every thing else in its favour. My aunt is acting	103: 26, 2B  !
4B	like a sensible woman in wishing for you. She is choosing	103: 26, 3B  !
4B	a friend and companion exactly where she ought, and	103: 26, 4B  !
4B	I am glad her love of money does not interfere. You	103: 26, 5B  !
4B	will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does not	103: 26, 6B  !
4B	distress you very much, Fanny."	103: 26, 7B  !
4A	"Indeed it does. I cannot like it. I love this house	103: 26, 8A  !
4A	and every thing in it. I shall love nothing there. You	103: 26, 9A  !
4A	know how uncomfortable I feel with her."	103: 26,10A  !
4B	"I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child;	103: 26,11B  !
4B	but it was the same with us all, or nearly so. She never	103: 26,12B  !
4B	knew how to be pleasant to children. But you are now	103: 26,13B  !
4B	of an age to be treated better; I think she \is\ behaving	103: 26,14B  !
4B	better already; and when you are her only companion,	103: 26,15B  !
4B	you \must\ be important to her."	103: 26,16B  !
4A	"I can never be important to any one."	103: 26,17A  !
4B	"What is to prevent you?"	103: 26,18B  !
4A	"Every thing ~ my situation ~ my foolishness and	103: 26,19A  !
4A	awkwardness."	103: 26,20A  !
4B	"As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear	103: 26,21B  !
4B	Fanny, believe me, you never have a shadow of either,	103: 26,22B  !
4B	but in using the words so improperly. There is no	103: 26,23B  !
4B	reason in the world why you should not be important	103: 26,24B  !
4B	where you are known. You have good sense, and a sweet	103: 26,25B  !
4B	temper, and I am sure you have a grateful heart, that	103: 26,26B  !
4B	could never receive kindness without wishing to return it.	103: 26,27B  !
4B	I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and	103: 26,28B  !
4B	companion."	103: 26,29B  !
4A	"You are too kind,"	103: 26,30A  !
4A	"how shall I ever thank you as I ought, for	103: 26,31A  !
4A	thinking so well of me? Oh| cousin, if I am to go	103: 26,32A  !
4A	away, I shall remember your goodness, to the last moment	103: 26,33A  !
4A	of my life."	103: 26,34A  !
4B	"Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered	103: 26,35B  !
4B	at such a distance as the White house. You speak as if	103: 26,36B  !
4B	you were going two hundred miles off, instead of only	103: 26,37B  !
4B	across the park. But you will belong to us almost as	103: 26,38B  !
4B	much as ever. The two families will be meeting every	103: 27, 1B  !
4B	day in the year. The only difference will be, that living	103: 27, 2B  !
4B	with your aunt, you will necessarily be brought forward,	103: 27, 3B  !
4B	as you ought to be. \Here\, there are too many, whom	103: 27, 4B  !
4B	you can hide behind; but with \her\ you will be forced to	103: 27, 5B  !
4B	speak for yourself."	103: 27, 6B  !
4A	"Oh| do not say so."	103: 27, 7A  !
4B	"I must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs% Norris	103: 27, 8B  !
4B	is much better fitted than my mother for having the	103: 27, 9B  !
4B	charge of you now. She is of a temper to do a great	103: 27,10B  !
4B	deal for any body she really interests herself about,	103: 27,11B  !
4B	and she will force you to do justice to your natural	103: 27,12B  !
4B	powers."	103: 27,13B  !
4A	"I cannot see things as you	103: 27,14A  !
4A	do; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than	103: 27,15A  !
4A	myself, and I am very much obliged to you for trying to	103: 27,16A  !
4A	reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose my	103: 27,17A  !
4A	aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel	103: 27,18A  !
4A	myself of consequence to any body| ~ \Here\, I know I am	103: 27,19A  !
4A	of none, and yet I love the place so well."	103: 27,20A  !
4B	"The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though	103: 27,21B  !
4B	you quit the house. You will have as free a command	103: 27,22B  !
4B	of the park and gardens as ever. Even \your\ constant	103: 27,23B  !
4B	little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change.	103: 27,24B  !
4B	You will have the same walks to frequent, the same	103: 27,25B  !
4B	library to choose from, the same people to look at, the	103: 27,26B  !
4B	same horse to ride."	103: 27,27B  !
4A	"Very true. Yes, dear old grey poney. Ah| cousin,	103: 27,28A  !
4A	when I remember how much I used to dread riding, what	103: 27,29A  !
4A	terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me	103: 27,30A  !
4A	good; ~ (Oh| how I have trembled at my uncle's opening	103: 27,31A  !
4A	his lips if horses were talked of) and then think of the	103: 27,32A  !
4A	kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of	103: 27,33A  !
4A	my fears, and convince me that I should like it after	103: 27,34A  !
4A	a little while, and feel how right you proved to be, I am	103: 27,35A  !
4A	inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well."	103: 27,36A  !
4B	"And I am quite convinced that your being with	103: 27,37B  !
4B	Mrs% Norris, will be as good for your mind, as riding has	103: 27,38B  !
4B	been for your health ~ and as much for your ultimate	103: 28, 1B  !
4B	happiness, too."	103: 28, 2B  !
4F	"I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer,	103: 28,22F  !
4F	when Fanny goes to live with you?"	103: 28,23F  !
4J	"Live with me, dear Lady Bertram,	103: 28,24J  !
4J	what do you mean?"	103: 28,25J  !
4F	"Is not she to live with you? ~ I thought you had	103: 28,26F  !
4F	settled it with Sir Thomas?"	103: 28,27F  !
4J	"Me| never. I never spoke a syllable about it to	103: 28,28J  !
4J	Sir Thomas, nor he to me. Fanny live with me| the	103: 28,29J  !
4J	last thing in the world for me to think of, or for any body	103: 28,30J  !
4J	to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven| what	103: 28,31J  !
4J	could I do with Fanny? ~ Me| a poor helpless, forlorn	103: 28,32J  !
4J	widow, unfit for any thing, my spirits quite broke down,	103: 28,33J  !
4J	what could I do with a girl at her time of life, a girl of	103: 28,34J  !
4J	fifteen| the very age of all others to need most attention	103: 28,35J  !
4J	and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test.	103: 28,36J  !
4J	Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing|	103: 28,37J  !
4J	Sir Thomas is too much my friend. Nobody that wishes	103: 28,38J  !
4J	me well, I am sure, would propose it. How came Sir Thomas	103: 29, 1J  !
4J	to speak to you about it?"	103: 29, 2J  !
4F	"Indeed, I do not know. I suppose he thought it	103: 29, 3F  !
4F	best."	103: 29, 4F  !
4J	"But what did he say? ~ He could not say he \wished\	103: 29, 5J  !
4J	me to take Fanny. I am sure in his heart he could not	103: 29, 6J  !
4J	wish me to do it."	103: 29, 7J  !
4F	"No, he only said he thought it very likely ~ and	103: 29, 8F  !
4F	I thought so too. We both thought it would be a comfort	103: 29, 9F  !
4F	to you. But if you do not like it, there is no more to be	103: 29,10F  !
4F	said. She is no incumbrance here."	103: 29,11F  !
4J	"Dear sister| If you consider my unhappy state,	103: 29,12J  !
4J	how can she be any comfort to me? Here am I a poor	103: 29,13J  !
4J	desolate widow, deprived of the best of husbands, my	103: 29,14J  !
4J	health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits	103: 29,15J  !
4J	still worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with	103: 29,16J  !
4J	barely enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman,	103: 29,17J  !
4J	and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the	103: 29,18J  !
4J	memory of the dear departed ~ what possible comfort	103: 29,19J  !
4J	could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny|	103: 29,20J  !
4J	If I could wish it for my own sake, I would not do so	103: 29,21J  !
4J	unjust a thing by the poor girl. She is in good hands,	103: 29,22J  !
4J	and sure of doing well. I must struggle through my	103: 29,23J  !
4J	sorrows and difficulties as I can."	103: 29,24J  !
4F	"Then you will not mind living by yourself quite	103: 29,25F  !
4F	alone?"	103: 29,26F  !
4J	"Dear Lady Bertram| what am I fit for but solitude?	103: 29,27J  !
4J	Now and then I shall hope to have a friend in my little	103: 29,28J  !
4J	cottage (I shall always have a bed for a friend); but the	103: 29,29J  !
4J	most part of my future days will be spent in utter seclusion.	103: 29,30J  !
4J	If I can but make both ends meet, that's all	103: 29,31J  !
4J	I ask for."	103: 29,32J  !
4F	"I hope, sister, things are not so very bad with you	103: 29,33F  !
4F	neither ~ considering. Sir Thomas says you will have	103: 29,34F  !
4F	six hundred a year."	103: 29,35F  !
4J	"Lady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot	103: 29,36J  !
4J	live as I have done, but I must retrench where I can, and	103: 29,37J  !
4J	learn to be a better manager. I \have\ \been\ a liberal	103: 29,38J  !
4J	housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed to	103: 30, 1J  !
4J	practice economy now. My situation is as much altered	103: 30, 2J  !
4J	as my income. A great many things were due from	103: 30, 3J  !
4J	poor Mr% Norris as clergyman of the parish, that cannot	103: 30, 4J  !
4J	be expected from me. It is unknown how much was	103: 30, 5J  !
4J	consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At	103: 30, 6J  !
4J	the White house, matters must be better looked after.	103: 30, 7J  !
4J	I \must\ live within my income, or I shall be miserable;	103: 30, 8J  !
4J	and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able	103: 30, 9J  !
4J	to do rather more ~ to lay by a little at the end of the	103: 30,10J  !
4J	year."	103: 30,11J  !
4F	"I dare say you will. You always do, don't you?"	103: 30,12F  !
4J	"My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those	103: 30,13J  !
4J	that come after me. It is for your children's good that	103: 30,14J  !
4J	I wish to be richer. I have nobody else to care for, but	103: 30,15J  !
4J	I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle	103: 30,16J  !
4J	among them, worth their having."	103: 30,17J  !
4F	"You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about	103: 30,18F  !
4F	them. They are sure of being well provided for. Sir Thomas	103: 30,19F  !
4F	will take care of that."	103: 30,20F  !
4J	"Why, you know Sir Thomas's means will be rather	103: 30,21J  !
4J	straitened, if the Antigua estate is to make such poor	103: 30,22J  !
4J	returns."	103: 30,23J  !
4F	"Oh| \that\ will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been	103: 30,24F  !
4F	writing about it, I know."	103: 30,25F  !
4J	"Well, Lady Bertram,"	103: 30,26J  !
4J	"I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to	103: 30,27J  !
4J	your family ~ and so if Sir Thomas should ever speak	103: 30,28J  !
4J	again about my taking Fanny, you will be able to say,	103: 30,29J  !
4J	that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ~	103: 30,30J  !
4J	besides that, I really should not have a bed to give	103: 30,31J  !
4J	her, for I must keep a spare room for a friend."	103: 30,32J  !
4J	"Nobody loved	103: 31,26J  !
4J	plenty and hospitality more than herself ~ nobody more	103: 31,27J  !
4J	hated pitiful doings ~ the parsonage she believed had	103: 31,28J  !
4J	never been wanting in comforts of any sort, had never	103: 31,29J  !
4J	borne a bad character in \her\ \time\, but this was a way of	103: 31,30J  !
4J	going on that she could not understand. A fine lady in	103: 31,31J  !
4J	a country parsonage was quite out of place. \Her\ store-room	103: 31,32J  !
4J	she thought might have been good enough for Mrs% Grant	103: 31,33J  !
4J	to go into. Enquire where she would, she could	103: 31,34J  !
4J	not find out that Mrs% Grant had ever had more than	103: 31,35J  !
4J	five thousand pounds."	103: 31,36J  !
4A	"Sir Thomas, who had done so	103: 33, 4A  !
4A	much for her and her brothers, and who was gone perhaps	103: 33, 5A  !
4A	never to return| that she should see him go without	103: 33, 6A  !
4A	a tear| ~ it was a shameful insensibility."	103: 33, 7A  !
4A	"This was so	103: 33,12A  !
4A	thoughtful and kind|"	103: 33,13A  !
4E	"If William does	103: 33,17E  !
4E	come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able to convince	103: 33,18E  !
4E	him that the many years which have passed since you	103: 33,19E  !
4E	parted, have not been spent on your side entirely without	103: 33,20E  !
4E	improvement ~ though I fear he must find his sister at	103: 33,21E  !
4E	sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten."	103: 33,22E  !
4B	"Fanny must have a horse,"	104: 36,16B  !
4B	"Fanny must have a horse,"	104: 36,32B  !
4J	"If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return,	104: 38,20J  !
4J	it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria	104: 38,21J  !
4J	well married,"	104: 38,22J  !
4B	"If this man had not twelve thousand	104: 40, 7B  !
4B	a year, he would be a very stupid fellow."	104: 40, 8B  !

4C	"if you can persuade	104: 42,31C  !
4C	him into any thing of the sort, it will be a fresh matter	104: 42,32C  !
4C	of delight to me, to find myself allied to any body so	104: 42,33C  !
4C	clever, and I shall only regret that you have not half-a-dozen	104: 42,34C  !
4C	daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade	104: 42,35C  !
4C	Henry to marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman.	104: 42,36C  !
4C	All that English abilities can do, has been	104: 42,37C  !
4C	tried already. I have three very particular friends who	104: 42,38C  !

4C	which they, their mothers, (very clever women,) as well	104: 43, 2C  !
4C	as my dear aunt and myself, have taken to reason, coax,	104: 43, 3C  !
4C	or trick him into marrying, is inconceivable| He is the	104: 43, 4C  !
4C	most horrible flirt that can be imagined. If your Miss Bertrams	104: 43, 5C  !
4C	do not like to have their hearts broke, let them	104: 43, 6C  !
4C	avoid Henry."	104: 43, 7C  !
4D	"No, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder	104: 43, 9D  !
4D	than Mary. You will allow for the doubts of youth and	104: 43,10D  !
4D	inexperience. I am of a cautious temper, and unwilling	104: 43,11D  !
4D	to risk my happiness in a hurry. Nobody can think	104: 43,12D  !
4D	more highly of the matrimonial state than myself. I consider	104: 43,13D  !
4D	the blessing of a wife as most justly described in	104: 43,14D  !
4D	those discreet lines of the poet, "Heaven's \last\ best gift."	104: 43,15D  !
4C	"There, Mrs% Grant, you see how he dwells on one	104: 43,16C  !
4C	word, and only look at his smile. I assure you he is very	104: 43,17C  !
4C	detestable ~ the admiral's lessons have quite spoiled him."	104: 43,18C  !
4C	"Oh| yes, I am not at all ashamed of it. I would	104: 43,25C  !
4C	have every body marry if they can do it properly; I do	104: 43,26C  !
4C	not like to have people throw themselves away; but	104: 43,27C  !
4C	every body should marry as soon as they can do it to	104: 43,28C  !
4C	advantage."	104: 43,29C  !
4D	"I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister,"	105: 45, 7D  !
4D	"they are very elegant,	105: 45, 9D  !
4D	agreeable girls."	105: 45,10D  !
4D	"Oh| yes, I like Julia best."	105: 45,13D  !
4D	"So I should suppose. She has the advantage in	105: 45,16D  !
4D	every feature, and I prefer her countenance ~ but I like	105: 45,17D  !
4D	Julia best. Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest,	105: 45,18D  !
4D	and I have found her the most agreeable, but I shall	105: 45,19D  !
4D	always like Julia best, because you order me."	105: 45,20D  !
4D	"Do not I tell you, that I like her best \at\ \first\?"	105: 45,23D  !
4D	"Yes, and I like her the better for it. An engaged	105: 45,26D  !
4D	woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged.	105: 45,27D  !
4D	She is satisfied with herself. Her cares are over, and she	105: 45,28D  !
4D	feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without	105: 45,29D  !
4D	suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged; no harm	105: 45,30D  !
4D	can be done."	105: 45,31D  !
4D	"But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him;	105: 45,34D  !
4D	\that\ is your opinion of your intimate friend. \I\ do not	105: 45,35D  !
4D	subscribe to it. I am sure Miss Bertram is very much	105: 45,36D  !
4D	attached to Mr% Rushworth. I could see it in her eyes,	105: 45,37D  !
4D	when he was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram	105: 45,38D  !
4D	to suppose she would ever give her hand without her	105: 46, 1D  !
4D	heart."	105: 46, 2D  !
4C	"We must leave him to himself I believe. Talking	105: 46, 4C  !
4C	does no good. He will be taken in at last."	105: 46, 5C  !
4C	"Oh| dear ~ Let him stand his chance and be taken in.	105: 46, 8C  !
4C	It will do just as well. Every body is taken in at some	105: 46, 9C  !
4C	period or other."	105: 46,10C  !
4C	"In marriage especially. With all due respect to such	105: 46,12C  !
4C	of the present company as chance to be married, my dear	105: 46,13C  !
4C	Mrs% Grant, there is not one in a hundred of either sex,	105: 46,14C  !
4C	who is not taken in when they marry. Look where I will,	105: 46,15C  !
4C	I see that it \is\ so; and I feel that it \must\ be so, when	105: 46,16C  !
4C	I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which	105: 46,17C  !
4C	people expect most from others, and are least honest	105: 46,18C  !
4C	themselves."	105: 46,19C  !
4C	"My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the	105: 46,22C  !
4C	state; but, however, speaking from my own observation,	105: 46,23C  !
4C	it is a mano euvring business. I know so many who have	105: 46,24C  !
4C	married in the full expectation and confidence of some	105: 46,25C  !
4C	one particular advantage in the connection, or accomplishment	105: 46,26C  !
4C	or good quality in the person, who have found	105: 46,27C  !
4C	themselves entirely deceived, and been obliged to put up	105: 46,28C  !
4C	with exactly the reverse| What is this, but a take in?"	105: 46,29C  !
4C	"Well done, sister| I honour your \esprit du corps\.	105: 47, 3C  !
4C	When I am a wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself;	105: 47, 4C  !
4C	and I wish my friends in general would be so too. It	105: 47, 5C  !
4C	would save me many a heart-ache."	105: 47, 6C  !
4C	"I begin now to understand you all,	105: 48,33C  !
4C	except Miss Price,"	105: 48,34C  !
4C	"Pray, is she out, or is she not?	105: 48,35C  !
4C	~ I am puzzled. ~ She dined at the parsonage, with the	105: 48,36C  !
4C	rest of you, which seemed like being \out\; and yet she	105: 48,37C  !
4C	says so little, that I can hardly suppose she \is\."	105: 48,38C  !
4B	"I believe I know what you mean ~ but I will not undertake	105: 49, 2B  !
4B	to answer the question. My cousin is grown up.	105: 49, 3B  !
4B	She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs and	105: 49, 4B  !
4B	not outs are beyond me."	105: 49, 5B  !
4C	"And yet in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained.	105: 49, 6C  !
4C	The distinction is so broad. Manners as well as	105: 49, 7C  !
4C	appearance are, generally speaking, so totally different.	105: 49, 8C  !
4C	Till now, I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken	105: 49, 9C  !
4C	as to a girl's being out or not. A girl not out, has	105: 49,10C  !
4C	always the same sort of dress; a close bonnet for instance,	105: 49,11C  !
4C	looks very demure, and never says a word. You may	105: 49,12C  !
4C	smile ~ but it is so I assure you ~ and except that it is	105: 49,13C  !
4C	sometimes carried a little too far, it is all very proper.	105: 49,14C  !
4C	Girls should be quiet and modest. The most objectionable	105: 49,15C  !
4C	part is, that the alteration of manners on being	105: 49,16C  !
4C	introduced into company is frequently too sudden. They	105: 49,17C  !
4C	sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to	105: 49,18C  !
4C	quite the opposite ~ to confidence| \That\ is the faulty	105: 49,19C  !
4C	part of the present system. one does not like to see	105: 49,20C  !
4C	a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing ~	105: 49,21C  !
4C	and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to	105: 49,22C  !
4C	speak the year before. Mr% Bertram, I dare say \you\	105: 49,23C  !
4C	have sometimes met with such changes."	105: 49,24C  !
4G	"I believe I have; but this is hardly fair; I see what	105: 49,25G  !
4G	you are at. You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson."	105: 49,26G  !
4C	"No indeed. Miss Anderson| I do not know who or	105: 49,27C  !
4C	what you mean. I am quite in the dark. But I \will\	105: 49,28C  !
4C	quiz you with a great deal of pleasure, if you will tell me	105: 49,29C  !
4C	what about."	105: 49,30C  !
4G	"Ah| you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite	105: 49,31G  !
4G	so far imposed on. You must have had Miss Anderson in	105: 49,32G  !
4G	your eye, in describing an altered young lady. You	105: 49,33G  !
4G	paint too accurately for mistake. It was exactly so.	105: 49,34G  !
4G	The Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of	105: 49,35G  !
4G	them the other day, you know. Edmund, you have heard	105: 49,36G  !
4G	me mention Charles Anderson. The circumstance was	105: 49,37G  !
4G	precisely as this lady has represented it. When Anderson	105: 49,38G  !
4G	first introduced me to his family, about two years ago, his	105: 50, 1G  !
4G	sister was not \out\, and I could not get her to speak to me.	105: 50, 2G  !
4G	I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson,	105: 50, 3G  !
4G	with only her and a little girl or two in the room ~ the	105: 50, 4G  !
4G	governess being sick or run away, and the mother in and	105: 50, 5G  !
4G	out every moment with letters of business; and I could	105: 50, 6G  !
4G	hardly get a word or a look from the young lady ~ nothing	105: 50, 7G  !
4G	like a civil answer ~ she screwed up her mouth, and turned	105: 50, 8G  !
4G	from me with such an air| I did not see her again for	105: 50, 9G  !
4G	a twelvemonth. She was then \out\. I met her at Mrs% Holford's ~	105: 50,10G  !
4G	and did not recollect her. She came up to me,	105: 50,11G  !
4G	claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance,	105: 50,12G  !
4G	and talked and laughed till I did not know which	105: 50,13G  !
4G	way to look. I felt that I must be the jest of the room	105: 50,14G  !
4G	at the time ~ and Miss Crawford, it is plain, has heard	105: 50,15G  !
4G	the story."	105: 50,16G  !
4C	"And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in	105: 50,17C  !
4C	it, I dare say, than does credit to Miss Anderson. It is	105: 50,18C  !
4C	too common a fault. Mothers certainly have not yet got	105: 50,19C  !
4C	quite the right way of managing their daughters. I do	105: 50,20C  !
4C	not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to set	105: 50,21C  !
4C	people right, but I do see that they are often wrong."	105: 50,22C  !
4G	"Those who are showing the world what female manners	105: 50,23G  !
4G	\should\ \be\,"	105: 50,24G  !
4G	"are doing	105: 50,24G  !
4G	a great deal to set them right."	105: 50,25G  !
4B	"The error is plain enough,"	105: 50,26B  !
4B	"such girls are ill brought up. They are	105: 50,27B  !
4B	given wrong notions from the beginning. They are	105: 50,28B  !
4B	always acting upon motives of vanity ~ and there is no	105: 50,29B  !
4B	more real modesty in their behaviour \before\ they appear	105: 50,30B  !
4B	in public than afterwards."	105: 50,31B  !
4C	"I do not know,"	105: 50,32C  !
4C	"Yes, I cannot agree with you there. It is certainly the	105: 50,33C  !
4C	modestest part of the business. It is much worse to	105: 50,34C  !
4C	have girls \not\ \out\, give themselves the same airs and take	105: 50,35C  !
4C	the same liberties as if they were, which I \have\ seen done.	105: 50,36C  !
4C	\That\ is worse than any thing ~ quite disgusting|"	105: 50,37C  !
4G	"Yes, \that\ is very inconvenient indeed,"	105: 50,38G  !
4G	"It leads one astray; one does not know what to	105: 51, 1G  !
4G	do. The close bonnet and demure air you describe so	105: 51, 2G  !
4G	well, (and nothing was ever juster,) tell one what is	105: 51, 3G  !
4G	expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from	105: 51, 4G  !
4G	the want of them. I went down to Ramsgate for a week	105: 51, 5G  !
4G	with a friend last September ~ just after my return from	105: 51, 6G  !
4G	the West Indies ~ my friend Sneyd ~ you have heard me	105: 51, 7G  !
4G	speak of Sneyd, Edmund; his father and mother and	105: 51, 8G  !
4G	sisters were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion place	105: 51, 9G  !
4G	they were out; we went after them, and found	105: 51,10G  !
4G	them on the pier. Mrs% and the two Miss Sneyds, with	105: 51,11G  !
4G	others of their acquaintance. I made my bow in form,	105: 51,12G  !
4G	and as Mrs% Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached	105: 51,13G  !
4G	myself to one of her daughters, walked by her side all the	105: 51,14G  !
4G	way home, and made myself as agreeable as I could; the	105: 51,15G  !
4G	young lady perfectly easy in her manners, and as ready	105: 51,16G  !
4G	to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that I could	105: 51,17G  !
4G	be doing any thing wrong. They looked just the same;	105: 51,18G  !
4G	both well dressed, with veils and parasols like other girls;	105: 51,19G  !
4G	but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my	105: 51,20G  !
4G	attention to the youngest, who was not \out\, and had most	105: 51,21G  !
4G	excessively offended the eldest. Miss Augusta ought not	105: 51,22G  !
4G	to have been noticed for the next six months, and Miss Sneyd,	105: 51,23G  !
4G	I believe, has never forgiven me."	105: 51,24G  !
4C	"That was bad indeed. Poor Miss Sneyd| Though	105: 51,25C  !
4C	I have no younger sister, I feel for her. To be neglected	105: 51,26C  !
4C	before one's time, must be very vexatious. But it was	105: 51,27C  !
4C	entirely the mother's fault. Miss Augusta should have	105: 51,28C  !
4C	been with her governess. Such half and half doings never	105: 51,29C  !
4C	prosper. But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price.	105: 51,30C  !
4C	Does she go to balls? Does she dine out every where, as	105: 51,31C  !
4C	well as at my sister's?"	105: 51,32C  !
4B	"No,"	105: 51,33B  !
4B	"I do not think she has ever	105: 51,33B  !
4B	been to a ball. My mother seldom goes into company	105: 51,34B  !
4B	herself, and dines no where but with Mrs% Grant, and	105: 51,35B  !
4B	Fanny stays at home with \her\."	105: 51,36B  !
4C	"Oh| then the point is clear. Miss Price is \not\ out."	105: 51,37C  !
4J	"Oh| for shame|"	106: 53, 8J  !
4J	"A prison,	106: 53, 8J  !
4J	indeed| Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the	106: 53, 9J  !
4J	world."	106: 53,10J  !
4J	"Well, and if they were \ten\,"	106: 53,27J  !
4J	"I am	106: 53,27J  !
4J	sure \you\ need not regard it. The expense need not be	106: 53,28J  !
4J	any impediment. If I were you, I should not think of	106: 53,29J  !
4J	the expense. I would have every thing done in the best	106: 53,30J  !
4J	style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as	106: 53,31J  !
4J	Sotherton Court deserves every thing that taste and	106: 53,32J  !
4J	money can do. You have space to work upon there, and	106: 53,33J  !
4J	grounds that will well reward you. For my own part, if	106: 53,34J  !
4J	I had any thing within the fiftieth part of the size of	106: 53,35J  !
4J	Sotherton, I should be always planting and improving,	106: 53,36J  !
4J	for naturally I am excessively fond of it. It would be	106: 53,37J  !
4J	too ridiculous for me to attempt any thing where I am	106: 53,38J  !
4J	now, with my little half acre. It would be quite a burlesque.	106: 54, 1J  !
4J	But if I had more room, I should take a prodigious	106: 54, 2J  !
4J	delight in improving and planting. We did a vast deal	106: 54, 3J  !
4J	in that way at the parsonage; we made it quite a different	106: 54, 4J  !
4J	place from what it was when we first had it. You young	106: 54, 5J  !
4J	ones do not remember much about it, perhaps. But if	106: 54, 6J  !
4J	dear Sir Thomas were here, he could tell you what improvements	106: 54, 7J  !
4J	we made; and a great deal more would have been	106: 54, 8J  !
4J	done, but for poor Mr% Norris's sad state of health. He	106: 54, 9J  !
4J	could hardly ever get out, poor man, to enjoy any thing,	106: 54,10J  !
4J	and \that\ disheartened me from doing several things that	106: 54,11J  !
4J	Sir Thomas and I used to talk of. If it had not been for	106: 54,12J  !
4J	\that\, we should have carried on the garden wall, and made	106: 54,13J  !
4J	the plantation to shut out the churchyard, just as Dr% Grant	106: 54,14J  !
4J	has done. We were always doing something, as it	106: 54,15J  !
4J	was. It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr% Norris's	106: 54,16J  !
4J	death, that we put in the apricot against the	106: 54,17J  !
4J	stable wall, which is now grown such a noble tree, and	106: 54,18J  !
4J	getting to such perfection, sir,"	106: 54,19J  !
4J	"Sir, it is a moor park, we bought it as a moor park,	106: 54,25J  !
4J	and it cost us ~ that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas,	106: 54,26J  !
4J	but I saw the bill, and I know it cost seven shillings, and	106: 54,27J  !
4J	was charged as a moor park."	106: 54,28J  !
4F	"Mr% Rushworth,"	106: 55,12F  !
4F	"if I were you,	106: 55,12F  !
4F	I would have a very pretty shrubbery. one likes to get	106: 55,13F  !
4F	out into a shrubbery in fine weather."	106: 55,14F  !
4A	"Cut down an avenue| What a pity| Does not it make	106: 56, 6A  !
4A	you think of Cowper? ""Ye fallen avenues, once more	106: 56, 7A  !
4A	I mourn your fate unmerited."""	106: 56, 8A  !
4B	"I am afraid the avenue	106: 56, 9B  !
4B	stands a bad chance, Fanny."	106: 56,10B  !
4A	"I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down,	106: 56,11A  !
4A	to see the place as it is now, in its old state; but I do	106: 56,12A  !
4A	not suppose I shall."	106: 56,13A  !
4B	"Have you never been there? No, you never can; and	106: 56,14B  !
4B	unluckily it is out of distance for a ride. I wish we could	106: 56,15B  !
4B	contrive it."	106: 56,16B  !
4A	"Oh| it does not signify. Whenever I do see it, you	106: 56,17A  !
4A	will tell me how it has been altered."	106: 56,18A  !
4C	"I collect,"	106: 56,19C  !
4C	"that Sotherton is	106: 56,19C  !
4C	an old place, and a place of some grandeur. In any	106: 56,20C  !
4C	particular style of building?"	106: 56,21C  !
4B	"The house was built in Elizabeth's time, and is a large,	106: 56,22B  !
4B	regular, brick building ~ heavy, but respectable looking,	106: 56,23B  !
4B	and has many good rooms. It is ill placed. It stands in	106: 56,24B  !
4B	one of the lowest spots of the park; in that respect,	106: 56,25B  !
4B	unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are fine,	106: 56,26B  !
4B	and there is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made	106: 56,27B  !
4B	a good deal of. Mr% Rushworth is quite right, I think, in	106: 56,28B  !
4B	meaning to give it a modern dress, and I have no doubt	106: 56,29B  !
4B	that it will be all done extremely well."	106: 56,30B  !
4C	"He is a well bred man; he makes the best of it."	106: 56,32C  !
4B	"I do not wish to influence Mr% Rushworth,"	106: 56,33B  !
4B	"but had I a place to new fashion, I should not put	106: 56,34B  !
4B	myself into the hands of an improver. I would rather	106: 56,35B  !
4B	have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own choice, and	106: 56,36B  !
4B	acquired progressively. I would rather abide by my	106: 56,37B  !
4B	own blunders than by his."	106: 56,38B  !
4C	"\You\ would know what you were about of course ~ but	106: 57, 1C  !
4C	that would not suit \me\. I have no eye or ingenuity for	106: 57, 2C  !
4C	such matters, but as they are before me; and had I a place	106: 57, 3C  !
4C	of my own in the country, I should be most thankful to	106: 57, 4C  !
4C	any Mr% Repton who would undertake it, and give me as	106: 57, 5C  !
4C	much beauty as he could for my money; and I should	106: 57, 6C  !
4C	never look at it, till it was complete."	106: 57, 7C  !
4A	"It would be delightful to \me\ to see the progress of it	106: 57, 8A  !
4A	all,"	106: 57, 9A  !
4C	"Ay ~ you have been brought up to it. It was no part	106: 57,10C  !
4C	of my education; and the only dose I ever had, being	106: 57,11C  !
4C	administered by not the first favourite in the world, has	106: 57,12C  !
4C	made me consider improvements \in\ \hand\ as the greatest	106: 57,13C  !
4C	of nuisances. Three years ago, the admiral, my honoured	106: 57,14C  !
4C	uncle, bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend	106: 57,15C  !
4C	our summers in; and my aunt and I went down to it	106: 57,16C  !
4C	quite in raptures; but it being excessively pretty, it was	106: 57,17C  !
4C	soon found necessary to be improved; and for three	106: 57,18C  !
4C	months we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel	106: 57,19C  !
4C	walk to step on, or a bench fit for use. I would have	106: 57,20C  !
4C	every thing as complete as possible in the country, shrubberies	106: 57,21C  !
4C	and flower gardens, and rustic seats innumerable;	106: 57,22C  !
4C	but it must be all done without my care. Henry is	106: 57,23C  !
4C	different, he loves to be doing."	106: 57,24C  !
4C	"Mr% Bertram,"	106: 57,30C  !
4C	"I have tidings of my harp	106: 57,30C  !
4C	at last.  I am assured that it is safe at Northampton;	106: 57,31C  !
4C	and there it has probably been these ten days, in spite of	106: 57,32C  !
4C	the solemn assurances we have so often received to the	106: 57,33C  !
4C	contrary."	106: 57,34C  !
4C	"The truth is, that our inquiries were too direct; we	106: 57,35C  !
4C	sent a servant, we went ourselves: this will not do seventy	106: 57,36C  !
4C	miles from London ~ but this morning we heard of it in	106: 57,37C  !
4C	the right way. It was seen by some farmer, and he told	106: 57,38C  !
4C	the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher's	106: 58, 1C  !
4C	son-in-law left word at the shop."	106: 58, 2C  !
4B	"I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever	106: 58, 3B  !
4B	means; and hope there will be no farther delay."	106: 58, 4B  !
4C	"I am to have it to morrow; but how do you think	106: 58, 5C  !
4C	it is to be conveyed? Not by a waggon or cart; ~ Oh| no,	106: 58, 6C  !
4C	nothing of that kind could be hired in the village. I might	106: 58, 7C  !
4C	as well have asked for porters and a hand-barrow."	106: 58, 8C  !
4B	"You would find it difficult, I dare say, just now, in the	106: 58, 9B  !
4B	middle of a very late hay harvest, to hire a horse and	106: 58,10B  !
4B	cart?"	106: 58,11B  !
4C	"I was astonished to find what a piece of work was	106: 58,12C  !
4C	made of it| To want a horse and cart in the country	106: 58,13C  !
4C	seemed impossible, so I told my maid to speak for one	106: 58,14C  !
4C	directly; and as I cannot look out of my dressing-closet	106: 58,15C  !
4C	without seeing one farm yard, nor walk in the shrubbery	106: 58,16C  !
4C	without passing another, I thought it would be only ask	106: 58,17C  !
4C	and have, and was rather grieved that I could not give	106: 58,18C  !
4C	the advantage to all. Guess my surprise, when I found	106: 58,19C  !
4C	that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most	106: 58,20C  !
4C	impossible thing in the world, had offended all the farmers,	106: 58,21C  !
4C	all the labourers, all the hay in the parish. As for Dr% Grant's	106: 58,22C  !
4C	bailiff, I believe I had better keep out of \his\ way;	106: 58,23C  !
4C	and my brother-in-law himself, who is all kindness in	106: 58,24C  !
4C	general, looked rather black upon me, when he found	106: 58,25C  !
4C	what I had been at."	106: 58,26C  !
4B	"You could not be expected to have thought on the	106: 58,27B  !
4B	subject before, but when you \do\ think of it, you must see	106: 58,28B  !
4B	the importance of getting in the grass. The hire of a cart	106: 58,29B  !
4B	at any time, might not be so easy as you suppose; our	106: 58,30B  !
4B	farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but in	106: 58,31B  !
4B	harvest, it must be quite out of their power to spare a	106: 58,32B  !
4B	horse."	106: 58,33B  !
4C	"I shall understand all your ways in time; but coming	106: 58,34C  !
4C	down with the true London maxim, that every thing is to	106: 58,35C  !
4C	be got with money, I was a little embarrassed at first by	106: 58,36C  !
4C	the sturdy independence of your country customs. However,	106: 58,37C  !
4C	I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry,	106: 58,38C  !
4C	who is good-nature itself, has offered to fetch it in his	106: 59, 1C  !
4C	barouche. Will it not be honourably conveyed?"	106: 59, 2C  !
4C	"I shall be most happy to play to you both,"	106: 59, 6C  !
4C	"at least, as long as you can like to listen;	106: 59, 7C  !
4C	probably much longer, for I dearly love music myself, and	106: 59, 8C  !
4C	where the natural taste is equal, the player must always	106: 59, 9C  !
4C	be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than one.	106: 59,10C  !
4C	Now, Mr% Bertram, if you write to your brother, I entreat	106: 59,11C  !
4C	you to tell him that my harp \is\ come, he heard so much	106: 59,12C  !
4C	of my misery about it. And you may say, if you please,	106: 59,13C  !
4C	that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his	106: 59,14C  !
4C	return, in compassion to his feelings, as I know his horse	106: 59,15C  !
4C	will lose."	106: 59,16C  !
4B	"If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do	106: 59,17B  !
4B	not at present foresee any occasion for writing."	106: 59,18B  !
4C	"No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth,	106: 59,19C  !
4C	would you ever write to him, nor he to you, if it could	106: 59,20C  !
4C	be helped. The occasion would never be foreseen. What	106: 59,21C  !
4C	strange creatures brothers are| You would not write to	106: 59,22C  !
4C	each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the	106: 59,23C  !
4C	world; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that	106: 59,24C  !
4C	such a horse is ill, or such a relation dead, it is done in the	106: 59,25C  !
4C	fewest possible words. You have but one style among you.	106: 59,26C  !
4C	I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every other respect	106: 59,27C  !
4C	exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults	106: 59,28C  !
4C	me, confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour	106: 59,29C  !
4C	together, has never yet turned the page in a letter; and	106: 59,30C  !
4C	very often it is nothing more than, ""Dear Mary, I am	106: 59,31C  !
4C	just arrived. Bath seems full, and every thing as usual.	106: 59,32C  !
4C	Your's sincerely."" That is the true manly style; that is	106: 59,33C  !
4C	a complete brother's letter."	106: 59,34C  !
4A	"When they are at a distance from all their family,"	106: 59,35A  !
4A	"they can	106: 59,36A  !
4A	write long letters."	106: 59,37A  !
4B	"Miss Price has a brother at sea,"	106: 59,38B  !
4B	"whose excellence as a correspondent, makes her think	106: 60, 1B  !
4B	you too severe upon us."	106: 60, 2B  !
4C	"At sea, has she? ~ In the King's service of course."	106: 60, 3C  !
4B	"Do you know any thing of my cousin's captain?"	106: 60,11B  !
4B	"Captain Marshall? You have a large	106: 60,12B  !
4B	acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?"	106: 60,13B  !
4C	"Among Admirals, large enough; but,"	106: 60,14C  !
4C	"we know very little of the inferior ranks.	106: 60,15C  !
4C	Post captains may be very good sort of men, but they do	106: 60,16C  !
4C	not belong to \us\. Of various admirals, I could tell you	106: 60,17C  !
4C	a great deal; of them and their flags, and the gradation	106: 60,18C  !
4C	of their pay, and their bickerings and jealousies. But in	106: 60,19C  !
4C	general, I can assure you that they are all passed over,	106: 60,20C  !
4C	and all very ill used. Certainly, my home at my uncle's	106: 60,21C  !
4C	brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of	106: 60,22C  !
4C	\Rears\, and \Vices\, I saw enough. Now, do not be suspecting	106: 60,23C  !
4C	me of a pun, I entreat."	106: 60,24C  !
4B	"It is a noble	106: 60,25B  !
4B	profession."	106: 60,26B  !

4C	if it make the fortune, and there be discretion	106: 60,28C  !
4C	in spending it. But, in short, it is not a favourite profession	106: 60,29C  !
4C	of mine. It has never worn an amiable form	106: 60,30C  !
4C	to \me\."	106: 60,31C  !
4D	"Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your	106: 61, 7D  !
4D	opinion of it,"	106: 61, 8D  !
4D	"But I fear there would	106: 61, 8D  !
4D	be some disappointment. You would not find it equal	106: 61, 9D  !
4D	to your present ideas. In extent it is a mere nothing ~	106: 61,10D  !
4D	you would be surprised at its insignificance; and as for	106: 61,11D  !
4D	improvement, there was very little for me to do; too	106: 61,12D  !
4D	little ~ I should like to have been busy much longer."	106: 61,13D  !

4D	of the ground, which pointed out even to a very young	106: 61,16D  !
4D	eye what little remained to be done, and my own consequent	106: 61,17D  !
4D	resolutions, I had not been of age three months	106: 61,18D  !
4D	before Everingham was all that it is now. My plan was	106: 61,19D  !
4D	laid at Westminster ~ a little altered perhaps at Cambridge,	106: 61,20D  !

4J	\their\ opinions; and for my own part I have been long	106: 62,12J  !
4J	wishing to wait upon your good mother again; nothing	106: 62,13J  !
4J	but having no horses of my own, could have made me so	106: 62,14J  !
4J	remiss; but now I could go and sit a few hours with	106: 62,15J  !
4J	Mrs% Rushworth while the rest of you walked about and	106: 62,16J  !
4J	settled things, and then we could all return to a late dinner	106: 62,17J  !
4J	here, or dine at Sotherton just as might be most agreeable	106: 62,18J  !
4J	to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight.	106: 62,19J  !
4J	I dare say Mr% Crawford would take my two	106: 62,20J  !
4J	nieces and me in his barouche, and Edmund can go on	106: 62,21J  !
4J	horseback, you know, sister, and Fanny will stay at home	106: 62,22J  !
4J	with you."	106: 62,23J  !
4B	"Well Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford	107: 63, 1B  !
4B	\now\?"	107: 63, 2B  !
4B	"How did you like her	107: 63, 3B  !
4B	yesterday?"	107: 63, 4B  !
4A	"Very well ~ very much. I like to hear her talk.	107: 63, 5A  !
4A	She entertains me; and she is so extremely pretty, that	107: 63, 6A  !
4A	I have great pleasure in looking at her."	107: 63, 7A  !
4B	"It is her countenance that is so attractive. She has	107: 63, 8B  !
4B	a wonderful play of feature| But was there nothing in her	107: 63, 9B  !
4B	conversation that struck you Fanny, as not quite right?"	107: 63,10B  !
4A	"Oh| yes, she ought not to have spoken of her uncle	107: 63,11A  !
4A	as she did. I was quite astonished. An uncle with whom	107: 63,12A  !
4A	she has been living so many years, and who, whatever his	107: 63,13A  !
4A	faults may be, is so very fond of her brother, treating him,	107: 63,14A  !
4A	they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it|"	107: 63,15A  !
4B	"I thought you would be struck. It was very wrong ~	107: 63,16B  !
4B	very indecorous."	107: 63,17B  !
4A	"And very ungrateful I think."	107: 63,18A  !
4B	"Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her	107: 63,19B  !
4B	uncle has any claim to her \gratitude\; his wife certainly	107: 63,20B  !
4B	had; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt's	107: 63,21B  !
4B	memory which misleads her here. She is awkwardly	107: 63,22B  !
4B	circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively	107: 63,23B  !
4B	spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for	107: 63,24B  !
4B	Mrs% Crawford, without throwing a shade on the admiral.	107: 63,25B  !
4B	I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in	107: 63,26B  !
4B	their disagreements, though the admiral's present conduct	107: 63,27B  !
4B	might incline one to the side of his wife: but it is natural	107: 63,28B  !
4B	and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt	107: 63,29B  !
4B	entirely. I do not censure her \opinions\; but there	107: 63,30B  !
4B	certainly \is\ impropriety in making them public."	107: 63,31B  !
4A	"Do not you think,"	107: 63,32A  !
4A	"that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon	107: 63,33A  !
4A	Mrs% Crawford, as her niece has been entirely brought up	107: 64, 1A  !
4A	by her? She cannot have given her right notions of what	107: 64, 2A  !
4A	was due to the admiral."	107: 64, 3A  !
4B	"That is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the	107: 64, 4B  !
4B	faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt; and it	107: 64, 5B  !
4B	makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has	107: 64, 6B  !
4B	been under. But I think her present home must do her	107: 64, 7B  !
4B	good. Mrs% Grant's manners are just what they ought	107: 64, 8B  !
4B	to be. She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing	107: 64, 9B  !
4B	affection."	107: 64,10B  !
4A	"Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters.	107: 64,11A  !
4A	She made me almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very	107: 64,12A  !
4A	highly the love or good nature of a brother, who will not	107: 64,13A  !
4A	give himself the trouble of writing any thing worth	107: 64,14A  !
4A	reading, to his sisters, when they are separated. I am	107: 64,15A  !
4A	sure William would never have used \me\ so, under any	107: 64,16A  !
4A	circumstances. And what right had she to suppose, that	107: 64,17A  !
4A	\you\ would not write long letters when you were absent?"	107: 64,18A  !
4B	"The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever	107: 64,19B  !
4B	may contribute to its own amusement or that of others;	107: 64,20B  !
4B	perfectly allowable, when untinctured by ill humour or	107: 64,21B  !
4B	roughness; and there is not a shadow of either in the	107: 64,22B  !
4B	countenance or manner of Miss Crawford, nothing sharp,	107: 64,23B  !
4B	or loud, or coarse. She is perfectly feminine, except in	107: 64,24B  !
4B	the instances we have been speaking of. \There\ she	107: 64,25B  !
4B	cannot be justified. I am glad you saw it all as I did."	107: 64,26B  !
4C	"My dear Miss Price,"	107: 68,15C  !
4C	"I am come to make my	107: 68,16C  !
4C	own apologies for keeping you waiting ~ but I have	107: 68,17C  !
4C	nothing in the world to say for myself ~ I knew it was very	107: 68,18C  !
4C	late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and, therefore,	107: 68,19C  !
4C	if you please, you must forgive me. Selfishness	107: 68,20C  !
4C	must always be forgiven you know, because there is no	107: 68,21C  !
4C	hope of a cure."	107: 68,22C  !
4B	"For there is more than time enough for my cousin to	107: 68,25B  !
4B	ride twice as far as she ever goes,"	107: 68,26B  !
4B	"and you	107: 68,26B  !
4B	have been promoting her comfort by preventing her	107: 68,27B  !
4B	from setting off half an hour sooner; clouds are now	107: 68,28B  !
4B	coming up, and she will not suffer from the heat as she	107: 68,29B  !
4B	would have done then. I wish \you\ may not be fatigued	107: 68,30B  !
4B	by so much exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this	107: 68,31B  !
4B	walk home."	107: 68,32B  !
4C	"No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse,	107: 68,33C  !
4C	I assure you,"	107: 68,34C  !
4C	"I am very strong. Nothing ever fatigues me, but	107: 68,35C  !
4C	doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way to you	107: 68,36C  !
4C	with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will	107: 68,37C  !
4C	have a pleasant ride, and that I may have nothing	107: 68,38C  !
4C	but good to hear of this dear, delightful, beautiful	107: 69, 1C  !
4C	animal."	107: 69, 2C  !
4A	"No, I do not know, not if you want the mare,"	107: 69,32A  !
4B	"I do not want her at all for myself,"	107: 69,34B  !
4B	"but	107: 69,34B  !
4B	whenever you are next inclined to stay at home, I think	107: 69,35B  !
4B	Miss Crawford would be glad to have her for a longer	107: 69,36B  !
4B	time ~ for a whole morning in short. She has a great	107: 69,37B  !
4B	desire to get as far as Mansfield common, Mrs% Grant	107: 69,38B  !
4B	has been telling her of its fine views, and I have no doubt	107: 70, 1B  !
4B	of her being perfectly equal to it. But any morning	107: 70, 2B  !
4B	will do for this. She would be extremely sorry to interfere	107: 70, 3B  !
4B	with you. It would be very wrong if she did. ~ \She\	107: 70, 4B  !
4B	rides only for pleasure, \you\ for health."	107: 70, 5B  !
4A	"I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,"	107: 70, 6A  !
4A	"I have been out very often lately, and would rather	107: 70, 7A  !
4A	stay at home. You know I am strong enough now to	107: 70, 8A  !
4A	walk very well."	107: 70, 9A  !
4B	"But where is	107: 71,13B  !
4B	Fanny? ~ Is she gone to bed?"	107: 71,14B  !
4J	"No, not that I know of,"	107: 71,15J  !
4J	"she	107: 71,15J  !
4J	was here a moment ago."	107: 71,16J  !
4J	"That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away	107: 71,20J  !
4J	all the evening upon a sofa. Why cannot you come and	107: 71,21J  !
4J	sit here, and employ yourself as \we\ do? ~ If you have	107: 71,22J  !
4J	no work of your own, I can supply you from the poor-basket.	107: 71,23J  !
4J	There is all the new calico that was bought last	107: 71,24J  !
4J	week, not touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my	107: 71,25J  !
4J	back by cutting it out. You should learn to think of	107: 71,26J  !
4J	other people; and take my word for it, it is a shocking	107: 71,27J  !
4J	trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a	107: 71,28J  !
4J	sofa."	107: 71,29J  !
4B	"Fanny,"	107: 71,36B  !
4B	"I am sure you have the headach?"	107: 71,37B  !
4B	"I can hardly believe you,"	107: 72, 1B  !
4B	"I know your	107: 72, 1B  !
4B	looks too well. How long have you had it?"	107: 72, 2B  !
4A	"Since a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat."	107: 72, 3A  !
4B	"Did you go out in the heat?"	107: 72, 4B  !
4J	"Go out| to be sure she did,"	107: 72, 5J  !
4J	"would you have her stay within such a fine day as this?	107: 72, 6J  !
4J	Were not we \all\ out? Even your mother was out to-day	107: 72, 7J  !
4J	for above an hour."	107: 72, 8J  !
4F	"Yes, indeed, Edmund,"	107: 72, 9F  !
4F	"I was out above an hour. I sat	107: 72,11F  !
4F	three quarters of an hour in the flower garden, while	107: 72,12F  !
4F	Fanny cut the roses, and very pleasant it was I assure	107: 72,13F  !
4F	you, but very hot. It was shady enough in the alcove,	107: 72,14F  !
4F	but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again."	107: 72,15F  !
4B	"Fanny has been cutting roses, has she?"	107: 72,16B  !
4F	"Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year.	107: 72,17F  !
4F	Poor thing| \She\ found it hot enough, but they were so	107: 72,18F  !
4F	full blown, that one could not wait."	107: 72,19F  !
4J	"There was no help for it certainly,"	107: 72,20J  !
4J	"but I question	107: 72,21J  !
4J	whether her headach might not be caught \then\, sister.	107: 72,22J  !
4J	There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and	107: 72,23J  !
4J	stooping in a hot sun. But I dare say it will be well	107: 72,24J  !
4J	to-morrow. Suppose you let her have your aromatic	107: 72,25J  !
4J	vinegar; I always forget to have mine filled."	107: 72,26J  !
4F	"She has got it,"	107: 72,27F  !
4F	"she has had	107: 72,27F  !
4F	it ever since she came back from your house the second	107: 72,28F  !
4F	time."	107: 72,29F  !
4B	"What|"	107: 72,30B  !
4B	"has she been walking	107: 72,30B  !
4B	as well as cutting roses; walking across the hot park to	107: 72,31B  !
4B	your house, and doing it twice, ma'am? ~ No wonder her	107: 72,32B  !
4B	head aches."	107: 72,33B  !
4F	"I was afraid it would be too much for her,"	107: 72,35F  !
4F	"but when the roses were gathered, your aunt	107: 72,36F  !
4F	wished to have them, and then you know they must be	107: 72,37F  !
4F	taken home."	107: 72,38F  !
4B	"But were there roses enough to oblige her to go	107: 73, 1B  !
4B	twice?"	107: 73, 2B  !
4F	"No; but they were to be put into the spare room to	107: 73, 3F  !
4F	dry; and, unluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of	107: 73, 4F  !
4F	the room and bring away the key, so she was obliged to	107: 73, 5F  !
4F	go again."	107: 73, 6F  !
4B	"And could nobody be employed on such an errand but	107: 73, 8B  !
4B	Fanny? ~ Upon my word, ma'am, it has been a very	107: 73, 9B  !
4B	ill-managed business."	107: 73,10B  !
4J	"I am sure I do not know how it was to have been	107: 73,11J  !
4J	done better,"	107: 73,12J  !
4J	"unless I had gone myself indeed; but I cannot be in	107: 73,13J  !
4J	two places at once; and I was talking to Mr% Green at	107: 73,14J  !
4J	that very time about your mother's dairymaid, by \her\	107: 73,15J  !
4J	desire, and had promised John Groom to write to	107: 73,16J  !
4J	Mrs% Jefferies	107: 73,16J  !
4J	about his son, and the poor fellow was waiting	107: 73,17J  !
4J	for me half an hour. I think nobody can justly accuse	107: 73,18J  !
4J	me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really	107: 73,19J  !
4J	I cannot do every thing at once. And as for Fanny's	107: 73,20J  !
4J	just stepping down to my house for me, it is not much	107: 73,21J  !
4J	above a quarter of a mile, I cannot think I was unreasonable	107: 73,22J  !
4J	to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a-day,	107: 73,23J  !
4J	early and late, ay and in all weathers too, and say nothing	107: 73,24J  !
4J	about it."	107: 73,25J  !
4B	"I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma'am."	107: 73,26B  !
4J	"If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she	107: 73,27J  !
4J	would not be knocked up so soon. She has not been out	107: 73,28J  !
4J	on horseback now this long while, and I am persuaded,	107: 73,29J  !
4J	that when she does not ride, she ought to walk. If she	107: 73,30J  !
4J	had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her.	107: 73,31J  !
4J	But I thought it would rather do her good after being	107: 73,32J  !
4J	stooping among the roses; for there is nothing so refreshing	107: 73,33J  !
4J	as a walk after a fatigue of that kind; and though	107: 73,34J  !
4J	the sun was strong, it was not so very hot. Between	107: 73,35J  !
4J	ourselves, Edmund,"	107: 73,36J  !
4J	"it was cutting the roses, and dawdling about in the	107: 73,37J  !
4J	flower-garden, that did the mischief."	107: 73,38J  !
4F	"I am afraid it was, indeed,"	107: 74, 1F  !
4F	"I am very much	107: 74, 2F  !
4F	afraid she caught the headach there, for the heat was	107: 74, 3F  !
4F	enough to kill any body. It was as much as I could bear	107: 74, 4F  !
4F	myself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep	107: 74, 5F  !
4F	him from the flower-beds, was almost too much for me."	107: 74, 6F  !
4J	"The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great	108: 76, 6J  !
4J	deal too much I assure you, my dear Mrs% Rushworth.	108: 76, 7J  !
4J	Ten miles there, and ten back, you know. You must	108: 76, 8J  !
4J	excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our two	108: 76, 9J  !
4J	dear girls and myself without her. Sotherton is the only	108: 76,10J  !
4J	place that could give her a \wish\ to go so far, but it cannot	108: 76,11J  !
4J	be indeed. She will have a companion in Fanny Price	108: 76,12J  !
4J	you know, so it will all do very well; and as for Edmund,	108: 76,13J  !
4J	as he is not here to speak for himself, I will answer for his	108: 76,14J  !
4J	being most happy to join the party. He can go on horseback,	108: 76,15J  !
4J	you know."	108: 76,16J  !
4J	"You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear	108: 76,24J  !
4J	madam,"	108: 76,25J  !
4J	"but as to Fanny, she will	108: 76,25J  !
4J	have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton. She	108: 76,26J  !
4J	has time enough before her; and her going now is quite	108: 76,27J  !
4J	out of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly	108: 76,28J  !
4J	spare her."	108: 76,29J  !
4F	"Oh| no ~ I cannot do without Fanny."	108: 76,30F  !
4B	"But why is it necessary,"	108: 77,14B  !
4B	"that Crawford's	108: 77,14B  !
4B	carriage, or his \only\ should be employed? Why	108: 77,15B  !
4B	is no use to be made of my mother's chaise? I could	108: 77,16B  !
4B	not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other day,	108: 77,17B  !
4B	understand why a visit from the family were not to be	108: 77,18B  !
4B	made in the carriage of the family."	108: 77,19B  !
4J	"And my dear Edmund,"	108: 77,26J  !
4J	"taking	108: 77,26J  !
4J	out \two\ carriages when \one\ will do, would be trouble for	108: 77,27J  !
4J	nothing; and between ourselves, coachman is not very	108: 77,28J  !
4J	fond of the roads between this and Sotherton; he always	108: 77,29J  !
4J	complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his	108: 77,30J  !
4J	carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear	108: 77,31J  !
4J	Sir Thomas when he comes home find all the varnish	108: 77,32J  !
4J	scratched off."	108: 77,33J  !
4B	"There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,"	108: 78, 1B  !
4B	"in going on the barouche box."	108: 78, 2B  !
4B	"There can be no objection then to Fanny's going	108: 78, 8B  !
4B	with you; there can be no doubt of your having room	108: 78, 9B  !
4B	for her."	108: 78,10B  !
4J	"Fanny|"	108: 78,11J  !
4J	"my dear Edmund,	108: 78,11J  !
4J	there is no idea of her going with us. She stays with	108: 78,12J  !
4J	her aunt. I told Mrs% Rushworth so. She is not	108: 78,13J  !
4J	expected."	108: 78,14J  !
4B	"You can have no reason I imagine madam,"	108: 78,15B  !
4B	"for wishing Fanny \not\ to be of	108: 78,16B  !
4B	the party, but as it relates to yourself, to your own	108: 78,17B  !
4B	comfort. If you could do without her, you would not	108: 78,18B  !
4B	wish to keep her at home?"	108: 78,19B  !
4F	"To be sure not, but I \cannot\ do without her."	108: 78,20F  !
4B	"You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do."	108: 78,21B  !
4B	"Yes,"	108: 78,22B  !
4B	"there is no necessity for my going, and I mean	108: 78,23B  !
4B	to stay at home. Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton.	108: 78,24B  !
4B	I know she wishes it very much. She has not often	108: 78,25B  !
4B	a gratification of the kind, and I am sure ma'am you	108: 78,26B  !
4B	would be glad to give her the pleasure now?"	108: 78,27B  !
4F	"Oh| yes, very glad, if your aunt sees no objection."	108: 78,28F  !
4J	"Very well, very well, just as you	108: 79,15J  !
4J	choose, settle it your own way, I am sure I do not care	108: 79,16J  !
4J	about it."	108: 79,17J  !

4A	with respect,"	108: 82,33A  !
4A	"Now, where is the avenue?	108: 82,33A  !
4A	The house fronts the east, I perceive. The avenue,	108: 82,34A  !
4A	therefore, must be at the back of it. Mr% Rushworth	108: 82,35A  !
4A	talked of the west front."	108: 82,36A  !
4D	"To be depriving	109: 84,16D  !
4D	themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other	109: 84,17D  !
4D	judgments, might be an evil even beyond the loss of	109: 84,18D  !
4D	present pleasure."	109: 84,19D  !
4A	"I am	109: 85,35A  !
4A	disappointed,"	109: 85,36A  !
4A	"This is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing	109: 85,37A  !
4A	awful here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. Here	109: 85,38A  !
4A	are no aisles, no arches, no inscriptions, no banners.	109: 86, 1A  !
4A	No banners, cousin, to be ""blown by the night wind	109: 86, 2A  !
4A	of Heaven."" No signs that a ""Scottish monarch sleeps	109: 86, 3A  !
4A	below."""	109: 86, 4A  !
4B	"You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been	109: 86, 5B  !
4B	built, and for how confined a purpose, compared with	109: 86, 6B  !
4B	the old chapels of castles and monasteries. It was only	109: 86, 7B  !
4B	for the private use of the family. They have been	109: 86, 8B  !
4B	buried, I suppose, in the parish church. \There\ you must	109: 86, 9B  !
4B	look for the banners and the atchievements."	109: 86,10B  !
4A	"It was foolish of me not to think of all that, but I am	109: 86,11A  !
4A	disappointed."	109: 86,12A  !
4C	"Every generation has its improvements,"	109: 86,23C  !
4A	"It is a pity,"	109: 86,28A  !
4A	"that the custom should	109: 86,28A  !
4A	have been discontinued. It was a valuable part of	109: 86,29A  !
4A	former times. There is something in a chapel and	109: 86,30A  !
4A	chaplain so much in character with a great house, with	109: 86,31A  !
4A	one's ideas of what such a household should be| A whole	109: 86,32A  !
4A	family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer,	109: 86,33A  !
4A	is fine|"	109: 86,34A  !
4C	"Very fine indeed|"	109: 86,35C  !

4C	to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave	109: 86,37C  !
4C	business and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice	109: 86,38C  !
4C	a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for	109: 87, 1C  !
4C	staying away."	109: 87, 2C  !
4B	"\That\ is hardly Fanny's idea of a family assembling,"	109: 87, 3B  !
4B	"If the master and mistress do \not\	109: 87, 4B  !
4B	attend themselves, there must be more harm than good	109: 87, 5B  !
4B	in the custom."	109: 87, 6B  !
4C	"At any rate, is safer to leave people to their own	109: 87, 7C  !
4C	devices on such subjects. Every body likes to go their	109: 87, 8C  !
4C	own way ~ to choose their own time and manner of	109: 87, 9C  !
4C	devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality,	109: 87,10C  !
4C	the restraint, the length of time ~ altogether it is a formidable	109: 87,11C  !
4C	thing, and what nobody likes: and if the good	109: 87,12C  !
4C	people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could	109: 87,13C  !
4C	have foreseen that the time would ever come when men	109: 87,14C  !
4C	and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when	109: 87,15C  !
4C	they woke with a headach, without danger of reprobation,	109: 87,16C  !
4C	because chapel was missed, they would have jumped	109: 87,17C  !
4C	with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine with what	109: 87,18C  !
4C	unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth	109: 87,19C  !
4C	did many a time repair to this chapel? The	109: 87,20C  !
4C	young Mrs% Eleanors and Mrs% Bridgets ~ starched up into	109: 87,21C  !
4C	seeming piety, but with heads full of something very	109: 87,22C  !
4C	different ~ especially if the poor chaplain were not worth	109: 87,23C  !
4C	looking at ~ and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very	109: 87,24C  !
4C	inferior even to what they are now."	109: 87,25C  !
4B	"Your lively mind can hardly be serious even	109: 87,29B  !
4B	on serious subjects. You have given us an amusing	109: 87,30B  !
4B	sketch, and human nature cannot say it was not so.	109: 87,31B  !
4B	We must all feel \at\ \times\ the difficulty of fixing our	109: 87,32B  !
4B	thoughts as we could wish; but if you are supposing it	109: 87,33B  !
4B	a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into	109: 87,34B  !
4B	a habit from neglect, what could be expected from the	109: 87,35B  !
4B	\private\ devotions of such persons? Do you think the	109: 87,36B  !
4B	minds which are suffered, which are indulged in wanderings	109: 87,37B  !
4B	in a chapel, would be more collected in a closet?"	109: 87,38B  !
4C	"Yes, very likely. They would have two chances at	109: 88, 1C  !
4C	least in their favour. There would be less to distract	109: 88, 2C  !
4C	the attention from without, and it would not be tried	109: 88, 3C  !
4C	so long."	109: 88, 4C  !
4B	"The mind which does not struggle against itself	109: 88, 5B  !
4B	under \one\ circumstance, would find objects to distract it	109: 88, 6B  !
4B	in the \other\, I believe; and the influence of the place and	109: 88, 7B  !
4B	of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun	109: 88, 8B  !
4B	with. The greater length of the service, however, I admit	109: 88, 9B  !
4B	to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind.	109: 88,10B  !
4B	one wishes it were not so ~ but I have not yet left Oxford	109: 88,11B  !
4B	long enough to forget what chapel prayers are."	109: 88,12B  !

4B	"Yes, I shall take orders soon after my father's return ~	109: 89,14B  !
4B	probably at Christmas."	109: 89,15B  !
4C	"If I had known this before,	109: 89,17C  !
4C	I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect,"	109: 89,18C  !
4D	"Query,"	109: 90,10D  !
4D	"whether we may not find something to employ us here,	109: 90,11D  !
4D	before we go farther? I see walls of great promise.	109: 90,12D  !
4D	Mr% Rushworth,	109: 90,12D  !
4D	shall we summon a council on this lawn?"	109: 90,13D  !
4C	"This is insufferably hot,"	109: 91,14C  !
4C	"Shall any of us object to being comfortable?	109: 91,17C  !
4C	Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get	109: 91,18C  !
4C	into it. What happiness if the door should not be	109: 91,19C  !
4C	locked| ~ but of course it is, for in these great places,	109: 91,20C  !
4C	the gardeners are the only people who can go where they	109: 91,21C  !
4C	like."	109: 91,22C  !
4C	"So you	109: 91,33C  !
4C	are to be a clergyman, Mr% Bertram. This is rather	109: 91,34C  !
4C	a surprise to me."	109: 91,35C  !
4B	"Why should it surprise you? You must suppose me	109: 91,36B  !
4B	designed for some profession, and might perceive that	109: 91,37B  !
4B	I am neither a lawyer, nor a soldier, nor a sailor."	109: 91,38B  !
4C	"Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me.	109: 92, 1C  !
4C	And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather	109: 92, 2C  !
4C	to leave a fortune to the second son."	109: 92, 3C  !
4B	"A very praiseworthy practice,"	109: 92, 4B  !
4B	"but	109: 92, 4B  !
4B	not quite universal. I am one of the exceptions, and	109: 92, 5B  !
4B	\being\ one, must do something for myself."	109: 92, 6B  !
4C	"But why are you to be a clergyman? I thought \that\	109: 92, 7C  !
4C	was always the lot of the youngest, where there were many	109: 92, 8C  !
4C	to choose before him."	109: 92, 9C  !
4B	"Do you think the church itself never chosen then?"	109: 92,10B  !
4C	"\Never\ is a black word. But yes, in the \never\ of	109: 92,11C  !
4C	conversation which means \not\ \very\ \often\, I do think it.	109: 92,12C  !
4C	For what is to be done in the church? Men love to	109: 92,13C  !
4C	distinguish themselves, and in either of the other lines,	109: 92,14C  !
4C	distinction may be gained, but not in the church. A	109: 92,15C  !
4C	clergyman is nothing."	109: 92,16C  !
4B	"The \nothing\ of conversation has its gradations, I hope,	109: 92,17B  !
4B	as well as the \never\. A clergyman cannot be high in	109: 92,18B  !
4B	state or fashion. He must not head mobs, or set the	109: 92,19B  !
4B	ton in dress. But I cannot call that situation nothing,	109: 92,20B  !
4B	which has the charge of all that is of the first importance	109: 92,21B  !
4B	to mankind, individually or collectively considered,	109: 92,22B  !
4B	temporally and eternally ~ which has the guardianship	109: 92,23B  !
4B	of religion and morals, and consequently of the manners	109: 92,24B  !
4B	which result from their influence. No one here can call	109: 92,25B  !
4B	the \office\ nothing. If the man who holds it is so, it is	109: 92,26B  !
4B	by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance,	109: 92,27B  !
4B	and stepping out of his place to appear what he	109: 92,28B  !
4B	ought not to appear."	109: 92,29B  !
4C	"\You\ assign greater consequence to the clergyman	109: 92,30C  !
4C	than one has been used to hear given, or than I can quite	109: 92,31C  !
4C	comprehend. One does not see much of this influence	109: 92,32C  !
4C	and importance in society, and how can it be acquired	109: 92,33C  !
4C	where they are so seldom seen themselves? How can	109: 92,34C  !
4C	two sermons a week, even supposing them worth hearing,	109: 92,35C  !
4C	supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair's	109: 92,36C  !
4C	to his own, do all that you speak of? govern the conduct	109: 92,37C  !
4C	and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the	109: 92,38C  !
4C	rest of the week? One scarcely sees a clergyman out	109: 93, 1C  !
4C	of his pulpit."	109: 93, 2C  !
4B	"\You\ are speaking of London, \I\ am speaking of the	109: 93, 3B  !
4B	nation at large."	109: 93, 4B  !
4C	"The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample	109: 93, 5C  !
4C	of the rest."	109: 93, 6C  !
4B	"Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice	109: 93, 7B  !
4B	throughout the kingdom. We do not look in great cities	109: 93, 8B  !
4B	for our best morality. It is not there, that respectable	109: 93, 9B  !
4B	people of any denomination can do most good; and it	109: 93,10B  !
4B	certainly is not there, that the influence of the clergy	109: 93,11B  !
4B	can be most felt. A fine preacher is followed and admired;	109: 93,12B  !
4B	but it is not in fine preaching only that a good	109: 93,13B  !
4B	clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood,	109: 93,14B  !
4B	where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size	109: 93,15B  !
4B	capable of knowing his private character, and observing	109: 93,16B  !
4B	his general conduct, which in London can rarely be the	109: 93,17B  !
4B	case. The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their	109: 93,18B  !
4B	parishioners. They are known to the largest part only	109: 93,19B  !
4B	as preachers. And with regard to their influencing	109: 93,20B  !
4B	public manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand	109: 93,21B  !
4B	me, or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding,	109: 93,22B  !
4B	the regulators of refinement and courtesy, the	109: 93,23B  !
4B	masters of the ceremonies of life. The \manners\ I speak of,	109: 93,24B  !
4B	might rather be called \conduct\, perhaps, the result of good	109: 93,25B  !
4B	principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines which	109: 93,26B  !
4B	it is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe,	109: 93,27B  !
4B	be every where found, that as the clergy are, or are	109: 93,28B  !
4B	not what they ought to be, so are the rest of the nation."	109: 93,29B  !
4A	"Certainly,"	109: 93,30A  !
4C	"There,"	109: 93,31C  !
4C	"you have quite	109: 93,31C  !

4C	"I do not think you ever will,"	109: 93,34C  !
4C	"I am just as much surprised now as I was at	109: 93,35C  !
4C	first that you should intend to take orders. You really	109: 93,36C  !
4C	are fit for something better. Come, do change your mind.	109: 93,37C  !
4C	It is not too late. Go into the law."	109: 93,38C  !

4B	"You need not hurry when the object is only to	109: 94, 6B  !
4B	prevent my saying a bon-mot, for there is not the least	109: 94, 7B  !
4B	wit in my nature. I am a very matter of fact, plain	109: 94, 8B  !
4B	spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a	109: 94, 9B  !
4B	repartee for half an hour together without striking it out."	109: 94,10B  !
4A	"I wonder	109: 94,12A  !

4B	What a difference in the weight of a woman's arm from	109: 94,27B  !
4B	that of a man| At Oxford I have been a good deal used	109: 94,28B  !
4B	to have a man lean on me for the length of a street, and	109: 94,29B  !
4B	you are only a fly in the comparison."	109: 94,30B  !
4C	"I am really not tired, which I almost wonder at;	109: 94,31C  !

4C	Do not you think we have?"	109: 94,33C  !
4B	"Not half a mile,"	109: 94,34B  !
4C	"Oh| you do not consider how much we have wound	109: 94,37C  !
4C	about. We have taken such a very serpentine course;	109: 94,38C  !
4C	and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight	109: 95, 1C  !
4C	line, for we have never seen the end of it yet, since we	109: 95, 2C  !
4C	left the first great path."	109: 95, 3C  !
4B	"But if you remember, before we left that first great	109: 95, 4B  !
4B	path, we saw directly to the end of it. We looked down	109: 95, 5B  !
4B	the whole vista, and saw it closed by iron gates, and it	109: 95, 6B  !
4B	could not have been more than a furlong in length."	109: 95, 7B  !
4C	"Oh| I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure	109: 95, 8C  !
4C	it is a very long wood; and that we have been winding	109: 95, 9C  !
4C	in and out ever since we came into it; and therefore	109: 95,10C  !
4C	when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must	109: 95,11C  !

4C	"Oh| do not attack me with your watch. A watch	109: 95,16C  !

4C	surprise; for there is nothing in the course of one's	109: 95,36C  !
4C	duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this	109: 95,37C  !
4C	morning ~ seeing a great house, dawdling from one room	109: 95,38C  !
4C	to another ~ straining one's eyes and one's attention ~	109: 96, 1C  !
4C	hearing what one does not understand ~ admiring what	109: 96, 2C  !
4C	one does not care for. ~ It is generally allowed to be the	109: 96, 3C  !
4C	greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price has found it so,	109: 96, 4C  !
4C	though she did not know it."	109: 96, 5C  !
4A	"I shall soon be rested,"	109: 96, 6A  !
4A	"to sit in the	109: 96, 6A  !
4A	shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure, is the most	109: 96, 7A  !
4A	perfect refreshment."	109: 96, 8A  !
4C	"I must move,"	109: 96,10C  !
4C	"resting fatigues me. ~ I have	109: 96,10C  !
4C	looked across the ha-ha till I am weary. I must go and	109: 96,11C  !
4C	look through that iron gate at the same view, without	109: 96,12C  !
4C	being able to see it so well."	109: 96,13C  !
4B	"Now, Miss Crawford,	109: 96,14B  !
4B	if you will look up the walk, you will convince yourself	109: 96,15B  !
4B	that it cannot be half a mile long, or half half a mile."	109: 96,16B  !
4C	"It is an immense distance,"	109: 96,17C  !
4C	"I see \that\	109: 96,17C  !
4C	with a glance."	109: 96,18C  !
4D	"It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as	110: 98,13D  !
4D	we are so far from the house already,"	110: 98,14D  !
4D	"No, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander,	110: 98,19D  !
4D	more complete in its style, though that style may not be	110: 98,20D  !
4D	the best. And to tell you the truth,"	110: 98,21D  !
4D	"I do not think that \I\ shall ever see Sotherton	110: 98,22D  !
4D	again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another	110: 98,23D  !
4D	summer will hardly improve it to me."	110: 98,24D  !
4D	"I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the	110: 98,29D  !
4D	world as might be good for me in some points. My	110: 98,30D  !
4D	feelings are not quite so evanescent, nor my memory of	110: 98,31D  !
4D	the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the	110: 98,32D  !
4D	case with men of the world."	110: 98,33D  !
4D	"Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not	110: 98,38D  !
4D	the least recollection at what. Oh| I believe I was relating	110: 99, 1D  !
4D	to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my	110: 99, 2D  !
4D	uncle's. Your sister loves to laugh."	110: 99, 3D  !
4D	"More easily amused,"	110: 99, 5D  !
4D	"consequently you	110: 99, 5D  !
4D	know,"	110: 99, 6D  !
4D	"better company. I could not have	110: 99, 6D  !
4D	hoped to entertain \you\ with Irish anecdotes during a ten	110: 99, 7D  !
4D	miles' drive."	110: 99, 8D  !
4D	"You have undoubtedly ~ and there are situations in	110: 99,11D  !
4D	which very high spirits would denote insensibility. Your	110: 99,12D  !
4D	prospects, however, are too fair to justify want of spirits.	110: 99,13D  !
4D	You have a very smiling scene before you."	110: 99,14D  !
4D	"And for the world you would not get out without	110: 99,22D  !
4D	the key and without Mr% Rushworth's authority and	110: 99,23D  !
4D	protection, or I think you might with little difficulty pass	110: 99,24D  !
4D	round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance;	110: 99,25D  !
4D	I think it might be done, if you really wished to be more	110: 99,26D  !
4D	at large, and could allow yourself to think it not	110: 99,27D  !
4D	prohibited."	110: 99,28D  !
4D	"Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him,	110: 99,32D  !
4D	that he will find us near that knoll, the grove of oak on	110: 99,33D  !
4D	the knoll."	110: 99,34D  !
4A	"You will hurt yourself,	110: 99,36A  !
4A	Miss Bertram,"	110: 99,37A  !
4A	"you will certainly hurt yourself	110: 99,37A  !
4A	against those spikes ~ you will tear your gown ~ you	110: 99,38A  !
4A	will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had	110:100, 1A  !
4A	better not go."	110:100, 2A  !
4A	"But, Julia, Mr% Rushworth will be here in a moment	110:100,30A  !
4A	with the key. Do wait for Mr% Rushworth."	110:100,31A  !
4A	"It is a pity that he should have so much trouble for	110:101, 9A  !
4A	nothing."	110:101,10A  !
4A	"They desired me to stay ~ my cousin Maria charged	110:101,30A  !
4A	me to say that you would find them at that knoll, or	110:101,31A  !
4A	thereabouts."	110:101,32A  !
4A	"I am very sorry,"	110:102, 1A  !
4A	"it is very unlucky."	110:102, 1A  !
4A	"Miss Bertram thought you would follow her."	110:102, 6A  !
4A	"I do not think him at all handsome."	110:102,12A  !
4A	"Nothing could be more obliging than your manner,	110:102,24A  !
4A	I am sure, and I dare say you walked as fast as you	110:102,25A  !
4A	could; but still it is some distance, you know, from	110:102,26A  !
4A	this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when	110:102,27A  !
4A	people are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and	110:102,28A  !
4A	every half minute seems like five."	110:102,29A  !
4A	"It is a pity you should not join	110:102,34A  !
4A	them. They expected to have a better view of the house	110:102,35A  !
4A	from that part of the park, and will be thinking how it	110:102,36A  !
4A	may be improved; and nothing of that sort, you know,	110:102,37A  !
4A	can be settled without you."	110:102,38A  !
4D	"I hope I am not to lose my companion, unless she is	110:105, 4D  !
4D	afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat."	110:105, 5D  !
4J	"Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon	110:105,16J  !
4J	my word|"	110:105,17J  !
4J	"Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end|	110:105,18J  !
4J	I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your	110:105,19J  !
4J	aunt Bertram and me, for contriving to let you go.	110:105,20J  !
4J	A pretty good day's amusement you have had|"	110:105,21J  !
4J	"My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that	110:105,27J  !
4J	nice old gardener would make me take; but if it is in your	110:105,28J  !
4J	way, I will have it in my lap directly. There Fanny, you	110:105,29J  !
4J	shall carry that parcel for me ~ take great care of it ~ do	110:105,30J  !
4J	not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like the excellent	110:105,31J  !
4J	one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that good	110:105,32J  !
4J	old Mrs% Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses.	110:105,33J  !
4J	I stood out as long as I could, till the tears almost came	110:105,34J  !
4J	into her eyes, and I knew it was just the sort that my	110:105,35J  !
4J	sister would be delighted with. That Mrs% Whitaker is	110:105,36J  !
4J	a treasure| She was quite shocked when I asked her	110:105,37J  !
4J	whether wine was allowed at the second table, and she has	110:105,38J  !
4J	turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns.	110:106, 1J  !
4J	Take care of the cheese, Fanny. Now I can manage the	110:106, 2J  !
4J	other parcel and the basket very well."	110:106, 3J  !
4J	"Spunging, my dear| It is nothing but four of those	110:106, 6J  !
4J	beautiful pheasant's eggs, which Mrs% Whitaker would	110:106, 7J  !
4J	quite force upon me; she would not take a denial. She	110:106, 8J  !
4J	said it must be such an amusement to me, as she understood	110:106, 9J  !
4J	I lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures	110:106,10J  !
4J	of that sort; and so to be sure it will. I shall get the	110:106,11J  !
4J	dairy maid to set them under the first spare hen, and if	110:106,12J  !
4J	they come to good I can have them moved to my own	110:106,13J  !
4J	house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great delight	110:106,14J  !
4J	to me in my lonely hours to attend to them. And if I have	110:106,15J  !
4J	good luck, your mother shall have some."	110:106,16J  !
4C	"How happy Mr% Rushworth	111:108,15C  !
4C	looks| He is thinking of November."	111:108,16C  !
4C	"Your father's return will be a very interesting event."	111:108,19C  !
4B	"It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not	111:108,20B  !
4B	only long, but including so many dangers."	111:108,21B  !
4C	"It will be the fore-runner also of other interesting	111:108,22C  !
4C	events; your sister's marriage, and your taking orders."	111:108,23C  !
4B	"Yes."	111:108,24B  !
4C	"Don't be affronted,"	111:108,25C  !
4C	"but it does	111:108,25C  !
4C	put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes, who	111:108,26C  !
4C	after performing great exploits in a foreign land, offered	111:108,27C  !
4C	sacrifices to the gods on their safe return."	111:108,28C  !
4B	"There is no sacrifice in the case,"	111:108,29B  !
4B	"It is entirely her own doing."	111:108,31B  !
4C	"Oh| yes, I know it is. I was merely joking. She has	111:108,32C  !
4C	done no more than what every young woman would do;	111:108,33C  !
4C	and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy. My	111:108,34C  !
4C	other sacrifice of course you do not understand."	111:108,35C  !
4B	"My taking orders I assure you is quite as voluntary as	111:108,36B  !
4B	Maria's marrying."	111:108,37B  !
4C	"It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's	111:108,38C  !
4C	convenience should accord so well. There is a very good	111:109, 1C  !
4C	living kept for you, I understand, hereabouts."	111:109, 2C  !
4B	"Which you suppose has biassed me."	111:109, 3B  !
4A	"But \that\ I am sure it has not,"	111:109, 4A  !
4B	"Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more	111:109, 5B  !
4B	than I would affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing	111:109, 6B  !
4B	that there was such a provision for me, probably did bias	111:109, 7B  !
4B	me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. There was	111:109, 8B  !
4B	no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no	111:109, 9B  !
4B	reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for	111:109,10B  !
4B	knowing that he will have a competence early in life.	111:109,11B  !
4B	I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have been	111:109,12B  !
4B	influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my	111:109,13B  !
4B	father was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no	111:109,14B  !
4B	doubt that I was biassed, but I think it was blamelessly."	111:109,15B  !
4A	"It is the same sort of thing,"	111:109,16A  !
4A	"as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy,	111:109,17A  !
4A	or the son of a general to be in the army, and nobody sees	111:109,18A  !
4A	any thing wrong in that. Nobody wonders that they	111:109,19A  !
4A	should prefer the line where their friends can serve them	111:109,20A  !
4A	best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they	111:109,21A  !
4A	appear."	111:109,22A  !
4C	"No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The	111:109,23C  !
4C	profession, either navy or army, is its own justification. It	111:109,24C  !
4C	has every thing in its favour; heroism, danger, bustle,	111:109,25C  !
4C	fashion. Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in	111:109,26C  !
4C	society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and	111:109,27C  !
4C	sailors."	111:109,28C  !
4B	"But the motives of a man who takes orders with the	111:109,29B  !
4B	certainty of preferment, may be fairly suspected, you	111:109,30B  !
4B	think?"	111:109,31B  !
4B	"To be justified in your eyes, he	111:109,31B  !
4B	must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any	111:109,32B  !
4B	provision."	111:109,33B  !
4C	"What| take orders without a living| No, that is	111:109,34C  !
4C	madness indeed, absolute madness|"	111:109,35C  !
4B	"Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man	111:109,36B  !
4B	is neither to take orders with a living, nor without? No,	111:109,37B  !
4B	for you certainly would not know what to say. But	111:109,38B  !
4B	I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your	111:110, 1B  !
4B	own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those	111:110, 2B  !
4B	feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward	111:110, 3B  !
4B	to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession, as	111:110, 4B  !
4B	heroism, and noise, and fashion are all against him, he	111:110, 5B  !
4B	ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity	111:110, 6B  !
4B	or good intentions in the choice of his."	111:110, 7B  !
4C	"Oh| no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an	111:110, 8C  !
4C	income ready made, to the trouble of working for one; and	111:110, 9C  !
4C	has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his	111:110,10C  !
4C	days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is indolence Mr% Bertram,	111:110,11C  !
4C	indeed. Indolence and love of ease ~ a want of	111:110,12C  !
4C	all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of	111:110,13C  !
4C	inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable, which	111:110,14C  !
4C	make men clergymen. A clergyman has nothing to do	111:110,15C  !
4C	but to be slovenly and selfish ~ read the newspaper, watch	111:110,16C  !
4C	the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate does all	111:110,17C  !
4C	the work, and the business of his own life is to dine."	111:110,18C  !
4B	"There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they	111:110,19B  !
4B	are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming	111:110,20B  !
4B	it their general character. I suspect that in this comprehensive	111:110,21B  !
4B	and (may I say) common-place censure, you	111:110,22B  !
4B	are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced	111:110,23B  !
4B	persons, whose opinions you have been in the habit of	111:110,24B  !
4B	hearing. It is impossible that your own observation can	111:110,25B  !
4B	have given you much knowledge of the clergy. You can	111:110,26B  !
4B	have been personally acquainted with very few of a set	111:110,27B  !
4B	of men you condemn so conclusively. You are speaking	111:110,28B  !
4B	what you have been told at your uncle's table."	111:110,29B  !
4C	"I speak what appears to me the general opinion;	111:110,30C  !
4C	and where an opinion is general, it is usually correct.	111:110,31C  !
4C	Though \I\ have not seen much of the domestic lives of	111:110,32C  !
4C	clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency	111:110,33C  !
4C	of information."	111:110,34C  !
4B	"Where any one body of educated men, of whatever	111:110,35B  !
4B	denomination, are condemned indiscriminately, there must	111:110,36B  !
4B	be a deficiency of information, or	111:110,37B  !
4B	of something	111:110,37B  !
4B	else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals, perhaps,	111:110,38B  !
4B	knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom,	111:111, 1B  !
4B	good or bad, they were always wishing away."	111:111, 2B  !
4A	"Poor William| He has met with great kindness from	111:111, 3A  !
4A	the chaplain of the Antwerp,"	111:111, 4A  !
4C	"I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from	111:111, 7C  !
4C	my uncle,"	111:111, 8C  !
4C	"that I can hardly	111:111, 8C  !
4C	suppose; ~ and since you push me so hard, I must observe,	111:111, 9C  !
4C	that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what	111:111,10C  !
4C	clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my	111:111,11C  !
4C	own brother, Dr% Grant. And though Dr% Grant is most	111:111,12C  !
4C	kind and obliging to me, and though he is really a gentleman,	111:111,13C  !
4C	and I dare say a good scholar and clever, and often	111:111,14C  !
4C	preaches good sermons, and is very respectable, \I\ see him	111:111,15C  !
4C	to be an indolent selfish bon vivant, who must have his	111:111,16C  !
4C	palate consulted in every thing, who will not stir a finger	111:111,17C  !
4C	for the convenience of any one, and who, moreover, if the	111:111,18C  !
4C	cook makes a blunder, is out of humour with his excellent	111:111,19C  !
4C	wife. To own the truth, Henry and I were partly driven	111:111,20C  !
4C	out this very evening, by a disappointment about a green	111:111,21C  !
4C	goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister	111:111,22C  !
4C	was forced to stay and bear it."	111:111,23C  !
4B	"I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my	111:111,24B  !
4B	word. It is a great defect of temper, made worse by a	111:111,25B  !
4B	very faulty habit of self-indulgence; and to see your sister	111:111,26B  !
4B	suffering from it, must be exceedingly painful to such	111:111,27B  !
4B	feelings as your's. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot	111:111,28B  !
4B	attempt to defend Dr% Grant."	111:111,29B  !
4A	"No,"	111:111,30A  !
4A	"but we need not give up his	111:111,30A  !
4A	profession for all that; because, whatever profession	111:111,31A  !
4A	Dr% Grant had chosen, he would have taken a ~ not	111:111,32A  !
4A	a good temper into it; and as he must either in the navy	111:111,33A  !
4A	or army have had a great many more people under his	111:111,34A  !
4A	command than he has now, I think more would have been	111:111,35A  !
4A	made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as	111:111,36A  !
4A	a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that whatever	111:111,37A  !
4A	there may be to wish otherwise in Dr% Grant,	111:111,38A  !
4A	would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse	111:112, 1A  !

4A	have had less time and obligation ~ where he might have	111:112, 3A  !
4A	escaped that knowledge of himself, the \frequency\, at least,	111:112, 4A  !
4A	of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape	111:112, 5A  !
4A	as he is now. A man ~ a sensible man like Dr% Grant,	111:112, 6A  !
4A	cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every	111:112, 7A  !
4A	week, cannot go to church twice every Sunday and preach	111:112, 8A  !
4A	such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does,	111:112, 9A  !
4A	without being the better for it himself. It must make him	111:112,10A  !
4A	think, and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to	111:112,11A  !
4A	restrain himself than he would if he had been any thing but	111:112,12A  !
4A	a clergyman."	111:112,13A  !
4C	"We cannot prove the contrary, to be sure ~ but I wish	111:112,14C  !
4C	you a better fate Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man	111:112,15C  !
4C	whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons; for	111:112,16C  !
4C	though he may preach himself into a good humour every	111:112,17C  !
4C	Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling	111:112,18C  !
4C	about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday	111:112,19C  !
4C	night."	111:112,20C  !

4A	lift the heart to rapture| When I look out on such a night	111:113,10A  !
4A	as this, I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor	111:113,11A  !
4A	sorrow in the world; and there certainly would be less of	111:113,12A  !
4A	both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to, and	111:113,13A  !
4A	people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating	111:113,14A  !
4A	such a scene."	111:113,15A  !

4B	night, and they are much to be pitied who have not been	111:113,17B  !
4B	taught to feel in some degree as you do ~ who have not at	111:113,18B  !

4B	very bright."	111:113,24B  !
4A	"Yes, and the bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia."	111:113,25A  !
4B	"We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be	111:113,26B  !
4B	afraid?"	111:113,27B  !
4A	"Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had	111:113,28A  !
4A	any star-gazing."	111:113,29A  !
4B	"Yes, I do not know how it has happened."	111:113,30B  !

4A	back again so soon, after being here so long before, full	112:115,37A  !
4A	seven weeks; for I had understood he was so very fond	112:115,38A  !
4A	of change and moving about, that I thought something	112:116, 1A  !
4A	would certainly occur when he was once gone, to take him	112:116, 2A  !
4A	elsewhere. He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield."	112:116, 3A  !
4B	"It is to his credit,"	112:116, 5B  !
4B	"and I	112:116, 5B  !
4B	dare say it gives his sister pleasure. She does not like	112:116, 6B  !
4B	his unsettled habits."	112:116, 7B  !
4A	"What a favourite he is with my cousins|"	112:116, 8A  !
4B	"Yes, his manners to women are such as must please.	112:116, 9B  !
4B	Mrs% Grant, I believe, suspects him of a preference for	112:116,10B  !
4B	Julia; I have never seen much symptom of it, but I wish	112:116,11B  !
4B	it may be so. He has no faults but what a serious attachment	112:116,12B  !
4B	would remove."	112:116,13B  !
4A	"If Miss Bertram were not engaged,"	112:116,14A  !
4A	"I could sometimes almost think that he	112:116,15A  !
4A	admired her more than Julia."	112:116,16A  !
4B	"Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia	112:116,17B  !
4B	best, than you, Fanny, may be aware; for I believe it	112:116,18B  !
4B	often happens, that a man, before he has quite made up	112:116,19B  !
4B	his own mind, will distinguish the sister or intimate friend	112:116,20B  !
4B	of the woman he is really thinking of, more than the	112:116,21B  !
4B	woman herself. Crawford has too much sense to stay here	112:116,22B  !
4B	if he found himself in any danger from Maria; and I am	112:116,23B  !
4B	not at all afraid for her, after such a proof as she has	112:116,24B  !
4B	given, that her feelings are not strong."	112:116,25B  !
4J	"I think, ma'am,"	112:117,15J  !

4J	"I dare say he did, ma'am. ~ Mr% Rushworth is never	112:117,25J  !

4J	so much of that true delicacy which one seldom	112:117,27J  !

4J	avoiding particularity| ~ Dear ma'am, only look at her	112:117,29J  !
4J	face at this moment; ~ how different from what it was	112:117,30J  !
4J	the two last dances|"	112:117,31J  !
4J	"It is quite delightful, ma'am,	112:118, 1J  !
4J	to see young people so properly happy, so well suited,	112:118, 2J  !
4J	and so much the thing| I cannot but think of dear Sir Thomas's	112:118, 3J  !
4J	delight. And what do you say, ma'am, to the	112:118, 4J  !
4J	chance of another match? Mr% Rushworth has set a good	112:118, 5J  !
4J	example, and such things are very catching."	112:118, 6J  !
4J	"The couple above, ma'am. Do you	112:118, 8J  !
4J	see no symptoms there?"	112:118, 9J  !
4J	"Four thousand a year."	112:118,12J  !
4J	"It is not a settled thing, ma'am, yet. ~ We only speak	112:118,17J  !
4J	of it among friends. But I have very little doubt it \will\	112:118,18J  !

4G	"I am	112:118,34G  !
4G	glad of it,"	112:118,35G  !
4G	"for I am tired to death. I	112:118,36G  !
4G	only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long. ~	112:118,37G  !
4G	They had need be \all\ in love, to find any amusement in	112:118,38G  !
4G	such folly ~ and so they are, I fancy. ~ If you look at them,	112:119, 1G  !
4G	you may see they are so many couple of lovers ~ all but	112:119, 2G  !
4G	Yates and Mrs% Grant ~ and, between ourselves, she, poor	112:119, 3G  !
4G	woman| must want a lover as much as any one of them.	112:119, 4G  !
4G	A desperate dull life her's must be with the doctor,"	112:119, 5G  !
4G	"A strange business this in America,	112:119,10G  !
4G	Dr% Grant| ~ What is your opinion? ~ I always come to	112:119,11G  !
4G	you to know what I am to think of public matters."	112:119,12G  !
4J	"My dear Tom,"	112:119,13J  !
4J	"as	112:119,13J  !
4J	you are not dancing, I dare say you will have no objection	112:119,14J  !
4J	to join us in a rubber; shall you?" ~	112:119,15J  !
4J	"We want to make a table for Mrs% Rushworth,	112:119,17J  !
4J	you know. ~ Your mother is quite anxious about	112:119,18J  !
4J	it, but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself,	112:119,19J  !
4J	because of her fringe. Now, you and I and Dr% Grant	112:119,20J  !
4J	will just do; and though \we\ play but half-crowns, you	112:119,21J  !
4J	know you may bet half-guineas with \him\."	112:119,22J  !
4G	"I should be most happy,"	112:119,23G  !
4G	"it would give me the greatest pleasure	112:119,24G  !

4G	Fanny," ~	112:119,26G  !
4G	"do not be dawdling any	112:119,26G  !
4G	longer, or the dance will be over."	112:119,27G  !
4G	"A pretty modest request upon my word|"	112:119,32G  !
4G	"To want to	112:119,33G  !
4G	nail me to a card table for the next two hours with herself	112:119,34G  !
4G	and Dr% Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that	112:119,35G  !
4G	poking old woman, who knows no more of whist than of	112:119,36G  !
4G	algebra. I wish my good aunt would be a little less busy|	112:119,37G  !
4G	And to ask me in such a way too| without ceremony,	112:119,38G  !
4G	before them all, so as to leave me no possibility of refusing|	112:120, 1G  !
4G	\That\ is what I dislike most particularly. It raises	112:120, 2G  !
4G	my spleen more than any thing, to have the pretence of	112:120, 3G  !
4G	being asked, of being given a choice, and at the same time	112:120, 4G  !
4G	addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very	112:120, 5G  !
4G	thing ~ whatever it be| If I had not luckily thought of	112:120, 6G  !
4G	standing up with you, I could not have got out of it. It is	112:120, 7G  !
4G	a great deal too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy	112:120, 8G  !
4G	in her head, nothing can stop her."	112:120, 9G  !
4G	"An after-piece instead of a comedy,"	113:122,38G  !

4G	Well, the jointure may comfort \him\; and perhaps,	113:123, 3G  !
4G	between friends, he began to tremble for his credit and	113:123, 4G  !
4G	his lungs in the Baron, and was not sorry to withdraw;	113:123, 5G  !
4G	and to make \you\ amends, Yates, I think we must raise	113:123, 6G  !
4G	a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to be our	113:123, 7G  !
4G	manager."	113:123, 8G  !
4G	"Oh| for the Ecclesford	113:123,16G  !
4G	theatre and scenery to try something with."	113:123,17G  !

4D	any character that ever was written, from Shylock	113:123,22D  !
4D	or Richard III% down to the singing hero of a farce in his	113:123,23D  !
4D	scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel as if I could be any thing	113:123,24D  !
4D	or every thing, as if I could rant and storm, or sigh,	113:123,25D  !
4D	or cut capers in any tragedy or comedy in the English	113:123,26D  !
4D	language. Let us be doing something. Be it only half	113:123,27D  !
4D	a play ~ an act ~ a scene; what should prevent us? Not	113:123,28D  !
4D	these countenances I am sure,"	113:123,29D  !

4G	"a few	113:123,33G  !
4G	yards of green baize for a curtain, and perhaps that may	113:123,34G  !

4B	"Nay,"	113:124, 8B  !
4B	"Let us do nothing by halves. If we are to act, let it be	113:124, 9B  !
4B	in a theatre completely fitted up with pit, box, and gallery,	113:124,10B  !
4B	and let us have a play entire from beginning to end; so	113:124,11B  !
4B	as it be a German play, no matter what, with a good tricking,	113:124,12B  !
4B	shifting after-piece, and a figure-dance, and a horn-pipe,	113:124,13B  !
4B	and a song between the acts. If we do not out do	113:124,14B  !
4B	Ecclesford, we do nothing."	113:124,15B  !
4B	"True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting;	113:124,19B  !
4B	but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to	113:124,20B  !
4B	look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred	113:124,21B  !
4B	to the trade, ~ a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have all	113:124,22B  !

4G	may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again.	113:125, 9G  !
4G	But one good thing I have just ascertained. It is the	113:125,10G  !
4G	very room for a theatre, precisely the shape and length	113:125,11G  !
4G	for it, and the doors at the farther end, communicating	113:125,12G  !
4G	with each other as they may be made to do in five minutes,	113:125,13G  !
4G	by merely moving the book-case in my father's room, is	113:125,14G  !
4G	the very thing we could have desired, if we had set down	113:125,15G  !
4G	to wish for it. And my father's room will be an excellent	113:125,16G  !
4G	green-room. It seems to join the billiard-room on	113:125,17G  !
4G	purpose."	113:125,18G  !
4B	"You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?"	113:125,19B  !
4G	"Not serious| never more so, I assure you. What is	113:125,21G  !
4G	there to surprise you in it?"	113:125,22G  !
4B	"I think it would be very wrong. In a \general\ light,	113:125,23B  !
4B	private theatricals are open to some objections, but as \we\	113:125,24B  !
4B	are circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious,	113:125,25B  !
4B	and more than injudicious, to attempt any thing	113:125,26B  !
4B	of the kind. It would show great want of feeling on my	113:125,27B  !
4B	father's account, absent as he is, and in some degree of	113:125,28B  !
4B	constant danger; and it would be imprudent, I think,	113:125,29B  !
4B	with regard to Maria, whose situation is a very delicate	113:125,30B  !
4B	one, considering every thing, extremely delicate."	113:125,31B  !

4G	to act three times a week till my father's return, and	113:125,33G  !
4G	invite all the country. But it is not to be a display of	113:125,34G  !
4G	that sort. We mean nothing but a little amusement	113:125,35G  !
4G	among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our	113:125,36G  !
4G	powers in something new. We want no audience, no	113:125,37G  !
4G	publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in choosing some	113:125,38G  !
4G	play most perfectly unexceptionable, and I can conceive	113:126, 1G  !
4G	no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in	113:126, 2G  !
4G	the elegant written language of some respectable author	113:126, 3G  !
4G	than in chattering in words of our own. I have no fears,	113:126, 4G  !
4G	and no scruples. And as to my father's being absent, it	113:126, 5G  !
4G	is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as	113:126, 6G  !
4G	a motive; for the expectation of his return must be a very	113:126, 7G  !
4G	anxious period to my mother, and if we can be the means	113:126, 8G  !
4G	of amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for	113:126, 9G  !
4G	the next few weeks, I shall think our time very well spent,	113:126,10G  !

4G	acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always	113:126,34G  !

4G	I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in	114:134,28G  !

4D	Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented	114:135, 6D  !

4D	powers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity	114:135, 9D  !
4D	without extravagance. I have seen good actresses	114:135,10D  !
4D	fail in the part. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the reach	114:135,11D  !

4G	well. She is too tall and robust. Amelia should be	114:135,21G  !
4G	a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It is fit for	114:135,22G  !
4G	Miss Crawford	114:135,22G  !

4J	you may be sure; mother had chanced to send him of	115:142, 2J  !
4J	a message to father, and then father had bid him bring	115:142, 3J  !
4J	up them two bits of board for he could not no how do	115:142, 4J  !

4J	servants' dinner bell was ringing at the very moment	115:142, 6J  !

4B	"Yes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what	116:153,31B  !
4B	to do. This acting scheme gets worse and worse you see.	116:153,32B  !
4B	They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could;	116:153,33B  !

4B	familiarity. I cannot think of it with any patience ~	116:154, 3B  !
4B	and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as	116:154, 4B  !

4B	same light?"	116:154, 6B  !

4B	"No	116:154,13B  !
4B	man can like being driven into the \appearance\ of such	116:154,14B  !
4B	inconsistency. After being known to oppose the scheme	116:154,15B  !

4B	joining them \now\, when they are exceeding their first	116:154,17B  !

4B	to create. It is all very bad| Put yourself in Miss Crawford's	116:154,30B  !
4B	place, Fanny. Consider what it would be	116:154,31B  !
4B	to act Amelia with a stranger. She has a right to be	116:154,32B  !
4B	felt for, because she evidently feels for herself. I heard	116:154,33B  !
4B	enough of what she said to you last night, to understand	116:154,34B  !
4B	her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger; and as	116:154,35B  !
4B	she probably engaged in the part with different expectations ~	116:154,36B  !
4B	perhaps, without considering the subject enough	116:154,37B  !
4B	to know what was likely to be, it would be ungenerous,	116:154,38B  !
4B	it would be really wrong to expose her to it. Her feelings	116:155, 1B  !
4B	ought to be respected. Does not it strike you so, Fanny?	116:155, 2B  !
4B	You hesitate."	116:155, 3B  !
4A	"I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry	116:155, 4A  !

4B	"They will not have much cause of triumph, when they	116:155, 8B  !
4B	see how infamously I act. But, however, triumph there	116:155, 9B  !

4B	the means of restraining the publicity of the business, of	116:155,11B  !
4B	limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall	116:155,12B  !
4B	be well repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can	116:155,13B  !
4B	do nothing; I have offended them, and they will not	116:155,14B  !
4B	hear me; but when I have put them in good humour by	116:155,15B  !
4B	this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading	116:155,16B  !
4B	them to confine the representation within a much smaller	116:155,17B  !
4B	circle than they are now in the high road for. This will	116:155,18B  !
4B	be a material gain. My object is to confine it to	116:155,19B  !
4B	Mrs% Rushworth	116:155,19B  !

4J	contrive Mr% Rushworth's cloak without sending for any	118:166,32J  !
4J	more satin; and now I think you may give me your help	118:166,33J  !
4J	in putting it together. ~ There are but three seams, you	118:166,34J  !
4J	may do them in a trice. ~ It would be lucky for me if	118:166,35J  !
4J	I had nothing but the executive part to do. ~ \You\ are best	118:166,36J  !
4J	off, I can tell you; but if nobody did more than \you\, we	118:166,37J  !
4J	should not get on very fast."	118:166,38J  !
4F	"One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny \should\ be	118:167, 4F  !
4F	delighted; it is all new to her, you know, ~ you and I used	118:167, 5F  !
4F	to be very fond of a play ourselves ~ and so am I still; ~	118:167, 6F  !
4F	and as soon as I am a little more at leisure, \I\ mean to look	118:167, 7F  !
4F	in at their rehearsals too. What is the play about, Fanny,	118:167, 8F  !
4F	you have never told me?"	118:167, 9F  !
4J	"Oh| sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not	118:167,10J  !
4J	one of those who can talk and work at the same time. ~ It is	118:167,11J  !
4J	about Lovers' Vows."	118:167,12J  !
4A	"I believe"	118:167,13A  !
4A	"there will	118:167,13A  !
4A	be three acts rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will	118:167,14A  !
4A	give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once."	118:167,15A  !
4J	"You had better stay till the curtain is hung,"	118:167,16J  !
4J	"the curtain will be hung in a day or	118:167,17J  !
4J	two, ~ there is very little sense in a play without a curtain	118:167,18J  !
4J	~ and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up	118:167,19J  !
4J	into very handsome festoons."	118:167,20J  !
4C	"Am I right? ~ Yes; this is the East room. My dear	118:168,15C  !
4C	Miss Price, I beg your pardon, but I have made my way to	118:168,16C  !
4C	you on purpose to entreat your help."	118:168,17C  !
4C	"Thank you ~ I am quite warm, very warm. Allow	118:168,21C  !
4C	me to stay here a little while, and do have the goodness to	118:168,22C  !
4C	hear me my third act. I have brought my book, and if	118:168,23C  !
4C	you would but rehearse it with me, I should be \so\ obliged|	118:168,24C  !
4C	I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund ~	118:168,25C  !
4C	by ourselves ~ against the evening, but he is not in the way;	118:168,26C  !
4C	and if he \were\, I do not think I could go through it with	118:168,27C  !
4C	\him\, till I have hardened myself a little, for really there \is\	118:168,28C  !
4C	a speech or two ~ You will be so good, won't you?"	118:168,29C  !
4C	"Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?"	118:168,32C  !
4C	"Here it is.	118:168,33C  !
4C	I did not think much of it at first ~ but, upon my word ~ .	118:168,34C  !
4C	There, look at \that\ speech, and \that\, and \that\.  How am	118:168,35C  !
4C	I ever to look him in the face and say such things? Could	118:168,36C  !
4C	you do it? But then he is your cousin, which makes all the	118:168,37C  !
4C	difference. You must rehearse it with me, that I may	118:168,38C  !
4C	fancy \you\ him, and get on by degrees. You \have\ a look of	118:169, 1C  !
4C	\his\ sometimes."	118:169, 2C  !
4A	"Have I? ~ I will do my best with the greatest readiness	118:169, 3A  !
4A	~ but I must \read\ the part, for I can \say\ very little of it."	118:169, 4A  !
4C	"\None\ of it, I suppose. You are to have the book of	118:169, 5C  !
4C	course. Now for it. We must have two chairs at hand	118:169, 6C  !
4C	for you to bring forward to the front of the stage. There	118:169, 7C  !
4C	~ very good school-room chairs, not made for a theatre,	118:169, 8C  !
4C	I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick	118:169, 9C  !
4C	their feet against when they are learning a lesson. What	118:169,10C  !
4C	would your governess and your uncle say to see them	118:169,11C  !
4C	used for such a purpose? Could Sir Thomas look in upon	118:169,12C  !
4C	us just now, he would bless himself, for we are rehearsing	118:169,13C  !
4C	all over the house. Yates is storming away in the dining room.	118:169,14C  !
4C	I heard him as I came up stairs, and the theatre	118:169,15C  !
4C	is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers,	118:169,16C  !
4C	Agatha and Frederick. If \they\ are not perfect, I \shall\	118:169,17C  !
4C	be surprised. By the bye, I looked in upon them five	118:169,18C  !
4C	minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the	118:169,19C  !
4C	times when they were trying \not\ to embrace, and Mr% Rushworth	118:169,20C  !
4C	was with me. I thought he began to look a little	118:169,21C  !
4C	queer, so I turned it off as well as I could, by whispering to	118:169,22C  !
4C	him, ""We shall have an excellent Agatha, there is something	118:169,23C  !
4C	so \maternal\ in her manner, so completely \maternal\ in	118:169,24C  !
4C	her voice and countenance."" Was not that well done of	118:169,25C  !
4C	me? He brightened up directly. Now for my soliloquy."	118:169,26C  !
4C	"Dr% Grant is ill,"	118:171,20C  !
4C	"He has been ill ever since; he did not eat any of the	118:171,21C  !
4C	pheasant to day. He fancied it tough ~ sent away his plate	118:171,22C  !
4C	~ and has been suffering ever since."	118:171,23C  !
4B	"Do Fanny, if it is not \very\ disagreeable	118:171,35B  !
4B	to you."	118:171,36B  !
4D	"You have only to \read\ the part,"	118:172, 6D  !
4E	"But where is Fanny? ~ Why do not I	201:177,38E  !
4E	see my little Fanny?",	201:178, 1E  !
4J	"Sure,	201:180,25J  !
4J	my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would be a much	201:180,26J  !
4J	better thing for you than tea. Do have a basin of soup."	201:180,27J  !
4E	"Still the same	201:180,28E  !
4E	anxiety for every body's comfort, my dear Mrs% Norris,"	201:180,29E  !
4E	"But indeed I would rather have	201:180,30E  !
4E	nothing but tea."	201:180,31E  !
4J	"Well then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea	201:180,32J  !
4J	directly, suppose you hurry Baddeley a little, he seems	201:180,33J  !
4J	behind hand to-night."	201:180,34J  !
4F	"How do you think the young people	201:181, 4F  !
4F	have been amusing themselves lately, Sir Thomas?	201:181, 5F  !
4F	They have been acting. We have been all alive with	201:181, 6F  !
4F	acting."	201:181, 7F  !
4E	"Indeed| and what have you been acting?"	201:181, 8E  !
4F	"Oh| They'll tell you all about it."	201:181, 9F  !
4G	"The \all\ will be soon told,"	201:181,10G  !
4G	"but it is not worth while to bore	201:181,11G  !
4G	my father with it now. You will hear enough of it	201:181,12G  !
4G	to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by way of	201:181,13G  !
4G	doing something, and amusing my mother, just within	201:181,14G  !
4G	the last week, to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We	201:181,15G  !
4G	have had such incessant rains almost since October began,	201:181,16G  !
4G	that we have been nearly confined to the house for days	201:181,17G  !
4G	together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3d.	201:181,18G  !
4G	Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been	201:181,19G  !
4G	no attempting any thing since. The first day I went	201:181,20G  !
4G	over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund took the copses	201:181,21G  !
4G	beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace between	201:181,22G  !
4G	us, and might each have killed six times as many; but	201:181,23G  !
4G	we respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much	201:181,24G  !
4G	as you could desire. I do not think you will find your	201:181,25G  !
4G	woods by any means worse stocked than they were.	201:181,26G  !
4G	\I\ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my	201:181,27G  !
4G	life as this year. I hope you will take a day's sport there	201:181,28G  !
4G	yourself, sir, soon."	201:181,29G  !
4B	"Something must be done,"	201:182, 1B  !
4G	"Then poor Yates is all alone,"	201:182, 8G  !
4G	"I will	201:182, 8G  !
4G	go and fetch him. He will be no bad assistant when it	201:182, 9G  !
4G	all comes out."	201:182,10G  !
4G	"particular friend,"	201:183,13G  !
4E	"I come from your theatre,"	201:184, 3E  !

4E	Its vicinity to my own room ~ but in every respect indeed	201:184, 5E  !
4E	it took me by surprize, as I had not the smallest suspicion	201:184, 6E  !
4E	of your acting having assumed so serious a character.	201:184, 7E  !
4E	It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by	201:184, 8E  !
4E	candle-light, and does my friend Christopher Jackson	201:184, 9E  !
4E	credit."	201:184,10E  !
4G	"This was in fact the origin of \our\ acting,"	201:184,25G  !
4G	"My friend Yates brought	201:184,26G  !
4G	the infection from Ecclesford, and it spread as those	201:184,27G  !
4G	things always spread you know, sir ~ the faster probably	201:184,28G  !
4G	from \your\ having so often encouraged the sort of thing	201:184,29G  !
4G	in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again."	201:184,30G  !

4E	"Mr% and Miss Crawford	201:185,33E  !
4E	were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do	201:185,34E  !
4E	you find them agreeable acquaintance?"	201:185,35E  !
4G	"Mr% Crawford was a most	201:186, 1G  !
4G	pleasant gentleman-like man; ~ his sister a sweet, pretty,	201:186, 2G  !
4G	elegant, lively girl."	201:186, 3G  !
4E	"I am happy to find our sentiments on	201:186,17E  !
4E	the subject so much the same. It gives me sincere	201:186,18E  !
4E	satisfaction. That I should be cautious and quick-sighted,	201:186,19E  !
4E	and feel many scruples which my children do	201:186,20E  !
4E	\not\ feel, is perfectly natural; and equally so that \my\	201:186,21E  !
4E	value for domestic tranquillity, for a home which shuts	201:186,22E  !
4E	out noisy pleasures, should much exceed theirs. But at	201:186,23E  !
4E	your time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable	201:186,24E  !
4E	circumstance for yourself and for every body connected	201:186,25E  !
4E	with you; and I am sensible of the importance of having	201:186,26E  !
4E	an ally of such weight."	201:186,27E  !
4B	"We have all been	202:187,11B  !
4B	more or less to blame,"	202:187,12B  !
4B	"every one of us, excepting	202:187,12B  !
4B	Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has judged	202:187,13B  !
4B	rightly throughout, who has been consistent. \Her\ feelings	202:187,14B  !
4B	have been steadily against it from first to last. She	202:187,15B  !

4J	the first visit, I am as certain as I sit here, that nothing	202:188,36J  !
4J	would have come of it ~ for Mr% Rushworth is the sort	202:188,37J  !
4J	of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of	202:188,38J  !
4J	encouragement, and there were girls enough on the	202:189, 1J  !
4J	catch for him if we had been idle. But I left no stone	202:189, 2J  !
4J	unturned. I was ready to move heaven and earth to	202:189, 3J  !
4J	persuade my sister, and at last I did persuade her. You	202:189, 4J  !
4J	know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle	202:189, 5J  !
4J	of winter, and the roads almost impassable, but I did	202:189, 6J  !
4J	persuade her."	202:189, 7J  !
4E	"I know how great, how justly great your influence	202:189, 8E  !

4E	concerned that it should not have been" ~	202:189,10E  !
4J	"My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of	202:189,11J  !
4J	the roads \that\ day| I thought we should never have	202:189,12J  !
4J	got through them, though we had the four horses of	202:189,13J  !
4J	course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of	202:189,14J  !
4J	his great love and kindness, though he was hardly able	202:189,15J  !
4J	to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had	202:189,16J  !
4J	been doctoring him for, ever since Michaelmas. I cured	202:189,17J  !
4J	him at last; but he was very bad all the winter ~ and	202:189,18J  !
4J	this was such a day, I could not help going to him up in	202:189,19J  !
4J	his room before we set off to advise him not to venture:	202:189,20J  !
4J	he was putting on his wig ~ so I said, "Coachman, you	202:189,21J  !
4J	had much better not go, your Lady and I shall be very	202:189,22J  !
4J	safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has	202:189,23J  !
4J	been upon the leaders so often now, that I am sure there	202:189,24J  !
4J	is no fear." But, however, I soon found it would not do;	202:189,25J  !
4J	he was bent upon going, and as I hate to be worrying	202:189,26J  !
4J	and officious, I said no more; but my heart quite ached	202:189,27J  !
4J	for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough	202:189,28J  !
4J	lanes about Stoke, where what with frost and snow upon	202:189,29J  !
4J	beds of stones, it was worse than any thing you can	202:189,30J  !
4J	imagine, I was quite in an agony about him. And then	202:189,31J  !
4J	the poor horses too| ~ To see them straining away| You	202:189,32J  !
4J	know how I always feel for the horses. And when we	202:189,33J  !
4J	got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you think	202:189,34J  !
4J	I did? You will laugh at me ~ but I got out and walked	202:189,35J  !
4J	up. I did indeed. It might not be saving them much,	202:189,36J  !
4J	but it was something, and I could not bear to sit at	202:189,37J  !
4J	my ease, and be dragged up at the expense of those	202:189,38J  !
4J	noble animals. I caught a dreadful cold, but \that\ I	202:190, 1J  !
4J	did not regard. My object was accomplished in the	202:190, 2J  !
4J	visit."	202:190, 3J  !
4E	"I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth	202:190, 4E  !
4E	any trouble that might be taken to establish it. There	202:190, 5E  !
4E	is nothing very striking in Mr% Rushworth's manners, but	202:190, 6E  !
4E	I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his	202:190, 7E  !
4E	opinion on \one\ subject ~ his decided preference of a quiet	202:190, 8E  !
4E	family-party to the bustle and confusion of acting. He	202:190, 9E  !
4E	seemed to feel exactly as one could wish."	202:190,10E  !
4J	"Yes, indeed, ~ and the more you know of him, the	202:190,11J  !
4J	better you will like him. He is not a shining character,	202:190,12J  !

4G	"I am sorry you are going ~ but as to our play,	202:193, 6G  !
4G	\that\ is all over ~ entirely at an end	202:193, 7G  !
4G	The painter was sent off yesterday, and	202:193, 8G  !

4B	father were more sensible of their very great attention	203:196,18B  !

4B	of animation among ourselves; my sisters seem out of	203:196,26B  !

4A	my uncle would not like \any\ addition. I think he values	203:196,31A  !
4A	the very quietness you speak of, and that the repose of his	203:196,32A  !
4A	own family-circle is all he wants. And it does not appear	203:196,33A  !
4A	to me that we are more serious than we used to be;	203:197, 1A  !
4A	I mean before my uncle went abroad. As well as I can	203:197, 2A  !
4A	recollect, it was always much the same. There was never	203:197, 3A  !
4A	much laughing in his presence; or, if there is any difference,	203:197, 4A  !
4A	it is not more I think than such an absence has	203:197, 5A  !
4A	a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of	203:197, 6A  !
4A	shyness. But I cannot recollect that our evenings	203:197, 7A  !
4A	formerly were ever merry, except when my uncle was in	203:197, 8A  !
4A	town. No young people's are, I suppose, when those	203:197, 9A  !
4A	they look up to are at home."	203:197,10A  !
4B	"I believe you are right, Fanny,"	203:197,11B  !
4B	"I believe our evenings are	203:197,12B  !
4B	rather returned to what they were, than assuming a new	203:197,13B  !
4B	character. The novelty was in their being lively. ~ Yet,	203:197,14B  !
4B	how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give|	203:197,15B  !
4B	I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before."	203:197,16B  !
4A	"I suppose I am graver than other people,"	203:197,17A  !
4A	"The evenings do not appear long to me. I love to hear	203:197,18A  !
4A	my uncle talk of the West Indies. I could listen to him	203:197,19A  !
4A	for an hour together. It entertains \me\ more than many	203:197,20A  !
4A	other things have done ~ but then I am unlike other people	203:197,21A  !
4A	I dare say."	203:197,22A  !
4B	"Why should you dare say \that?\	203:197,23B  !
4B	Do you	203:197,23B  !
4B	want to be told that you are only unlike other people in	203:197,24B  !
4B	being more wise and discreet? But when did you or any body	203:197,25B  !
4B	ever get a compliment from me, Fanny? Go to my	203:197,26B  !
4B	father if you want to be complimented. He will satisfy	203:197,27B  !
4B	you. Ask your uncle what he thinks, and you will hear	203:197,28B  !
4B	compliments enough; and though they may be chiefly on	203:197,29B  !
4B	your person, you must put up with it, and trust to his	203:197,30B  !
4B	seeing as much beauty of mind in time."	203:197,31B  !
4B	"Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny ~ and	203:197,34B  !
4B	that is the long and the short of the matter. Anybody but	203:197,35B  !
4B	myself would have made something more of it, and any body	203:197,36B  !
4B	but you would resent that you had not been thought	203:197,37B  !
4B	very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle	203:197,38B  !
4B	never did admire you till now ~ and now he does. Your	203:198, 1B  !
4B	complexion is so improved| ~ and you have gained so	203:198, 2B  !
4B	much countenance| ~ and your figure ~ Nay, Fanny, do	203:198, 3B  !
4B	not turn away about it ~ it is but an uncle. If you cannot	203:198, 4B  !
4B	bear an uncle's admiration what is to become of you?	203:198, 5B  !
4B	You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of	203:198, 6B  !
4B	being worth looking at. ~ You must try not to mind	203:198, 7B  !
4B	growing up into a pretty woman."	203:198, 8B  !
4A	"Oh| don't talk so, don't talk so,"	203:198, 9A  !
4B	"Your uncle is disposed to be	203:198,12B  !
4B	pleased with you in every respect; and I only wish you	203:198,13B  !
4B	would talk to him more. ~ You are one of those who are too	203:198,14B  !
4B	silent in the evening circle."	203:198,15B  !
4A	"But I do talk to him more than I used. I am sure I do.	203:198,16A  !
4A	Did not you hear me ask him about the slave trade last	203:198,17A  !
4A	night?"	203:198,18A  !
4B	"I did ~ and was in hopes the question would be	203:198,19B  !
4B	followed up by others. It would have pleased your uncle	203:198,20B  !
4B	to be inquired of farther."	203:198,21B  !
4A	"And I longed to do it ~ but there was such a dead	203:198,22A  !
4A	silence| And while my cousins were sitting by without	203:198,23A  !
4A	speaking a word, or seeming at all interested in the subject,	203:198,24A  !
4A	I did not like ~ I thought it would appear as if I wanted to	203:198,25A  !
4A	set myself off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity and	203:198,26A  !
4A	pleasure in his information which he must wish his own	203:198,27A  !
4A	daughters to feel."	203:198,28A  !
4B	"Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you	203:198,29B  !
4B	the other day ~ that you seemed almost as fearful of notice	203:198,30B  !
4B	and praise as other women were of neglect. We were	203:198,31B  !
4B	talking of you at the Parsonage, and those were her words.	203:198,32B  !
4B	She has great discernment. I know nobody who distinguishes	203:198,33B  !
4B	characters better. ~ For so young a woman it is	203:198,34B  !
4B	remarkable| She certainly understands \you\ better than	203:198,35B  !
4B	you are understood by the greater part of those who have	203:198,36B  !
4B	known you so long; and with regard to some others,	203:198,37B  !
4B	I can perceive, from occasional lively hints, the unguarded	203:198,38B  !
4B	expressions of the moment, that she could define \many\ as	203:199, 1B  !
4B	accurately, did not delicacy forbid it. I wonder what she	203:199, 2B  !
4B	thinks of my father| She must admire him as a fine looking	203:199, 3B  !
4B	man, with most gentleman-like, dignified, consistent	203:199, 4B  !
4B	manners; but perhaps having seen him so seldom, his	203:199, 5B  !
4B	reserve may be a little repulsive. Could they be much	203:199, 6B  !
4B	together I feel sure of their liking each other. He would	203:199, 7B  !
4B	enjoy her liveliness ~ and she has talents to value his	203:199, 8B  !
4B	powers. I wish they met more frequently| ~ I hope she	203:199, 9B  !
4B	does not suppose there is any dislike on his side."	203:199,10B  !
4A	"She must know herself too secure of the regard of all	203:199,11A  !
4A	the rest of you,"	203:199,12A  !
4A	"to have any	203:199,12A  !
4A	such apprehension. And Sir Thomas's wishing just at	203:199,13A  !
4A	first to be only with his family is so very natural, that she	203:199,14A  !
4A	can argue nothing from that. After a little while I dare	203:199,15A  !
4A	say we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way,	203:199,16A  !
4A	allowing for the difference of the time of year."	203:199,17A  !
4B	"This is the first October that she has passed in the	203:199,18B  !
4B	country since her infancy. I do not call Tunbridge or	203:199,19B  !
4B	Cheltenham the country; and November is a still more	203:199,20B  !
4B	serious month, and I can see that Mrs% Grant is very	203:199,21B  !
4B	anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter	203:199,22B  !
4B	comes on."	203:199,23B  !
4A	"To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and	203:199,31A  !
4A	you and Mr% Bertram too. We shall be quite a small party	203:199,32A  !
4A	at home. I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr% Rushworth	203:199,33A  !
4B	"That is impossible, Fanny. He must like him less	203:199,35B  !
4B	after to-morrow's visit, for we shall be five hours in his	203:199,36B  !
4B	company. I should dread the stupidity of the day, if	203:199,37B  !
4B	there were not a much greater evil to follow ~ the impression	203:199,38B  !
4B	it must leave on Sir Thomas. He cannot much longer	203:200, 1B  !
4B	deceive himself. I am sorry for them all, and would give	203:200, 2B  !
4B	something that Rushworth and Maria had never met."	203:200, 3B  !
4C	"shall I play to you now?" ~	204:207, 3C  !
4C	"what will you have?"	204:207, 4C  !
4C	"Another quarter of an hour,"	204:207,12C  !
4C	"and we shall see how it will be. Do not run away	204:207,13C  !
4C	the first moment of its holding up. Those clouds look	204:207,14C  !
4C	alarming."	204:207,15C  !
4A	"But they are passed over,"	204:207,16A  !
4A	"I have been	204:207,16A  !
4A	watching them. ~ This weather is all from the south."	204:207,17A  !
4C	"South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it;	204:207,18C  !
4C	and you must not set forward while it is so threatening.	204:207,19C  !
4C	And besides, I want to play something more to you ~ a very	204:207,20C  !
4C	pretty piece ~ and your cousin Edmund's prime favourite.	204:207,21C  !
4C	You must stay and hear your cousin's favourite."	204:207,22C  !
4A	"This is pretty ~ very pretty,"	204:208,22A  !
4A	"Every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck	204:208,24A  !
4A	with its growth and beauty. Three years ago, this was	204:208,25A  !
4A	nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the	204:208,26A  !
4A	field, never thought of as any thing, or capable of becoming	204:208,27A  !
4A	any thing; and now it is converted into a walk, and	204:208,28A  !
4A	it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as	204:208,29A  !
4A	a convenience or an ornament; and perhaps in another	204:208,30A  !
4A	three years we may be forgetting ~ almost forgetting what	204:208,31A  !
4A	it was before. How wonderful, how very wonderful the	204:208,32A  !
4A	operations of time, and the changes of the human mind|"	204:208,33A  !
4A	"If any one faculty of our nature may be	204:208,35A  !
4A	called \more\ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is	204:208,36A  !
4A	memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible	204:208,37A  !
4A	in the powers, the failures, the inequalities	204:208,38A  !
4A	of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The	204:209, 1A  !
4A	memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so	204:209, 2A  !
4A	obedient ~ at others, so bewildered and so weak ~ and at	204:209, 3A  !
4A	others again, so tyrannic, so beyond controul| ~ We are	204:209, 4A  !
4A	to be sure a miracle every way ~ but our powers of recollecting	204:209, 5A  !
4A	and of forgetting, do seem peculiarly past finding	204:209, 6A  !
4A	out."	204:209, 7A  !
4A	"It may seem impertinent in \me\ to praise, but I must	204:209,11A  !
4A	admire the taste Mrs% Grant has shewn in all this. There	204:209,12A  !
4A	is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk| ~ not	204:209,13A  !
4A	too much attempted|"	204:209,14A  !
4C	"Yes,"	204:209,15C  !
4C	"it does very	204:209,15C  !
4C	well for a place of this sort. One does not think of extent	204:209,16C  !
4C	\here\ ~ and between ourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I	204:209,17C  !

4A	soil here is better than his own, and so it appears from	204:209,22A  !
4A	the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general. ~ The	204:209,23A  !
4A	evergreen| ~ How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful	204:209,24A  !
4A	the evergreen| ~ When one thinks of it, how astonishing	204:209,25A  !
4A	a variety of nature| ~ In some countries we know the	204:209,26A  !
4A	tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that does not	204:209,27A  !
4A	make it less amazing, that the same soil and the same sun	204:209,28A  !
4A	should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law	204:209,29A  !
4A	of their existence. You will think me rhapsodizing; but	204:209,30A  !
4A	when I am out of doors, especially when I am sitting out	204:209,31A  !
4A	of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering	204:209,32A  !
4A	strain. One cannot fix one's eyes on the commonest	204:209,33A  !
4A	natural production without finding food for a rambling	204:209,34A  !

4C	"I am	204:209,36C  !
4C	something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV;	204:209,37C  !
4C	and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery	204:209,38C  !
4C	equal to seeing myself in it. If any body had told me	204:210, 1C  !
4C	a year ago that this place would be my home, that I	204:210, 2C  !
4C	should be spending month after month here, as I have	204:210, 3C  !

4C	happy hours. I expect we shall be all very much at	204:210,33C  !
4C	Sotherton another year. Such a match as Miss Bertram	204:210,34C  !

4C	be plagued very often and never lose your temper."	204:213, 5C  !
4C	"I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel any thing	204:213,13C  !
4C	of the sort. A large income is the best recipe= for happiness	204:213,14C  !
4C	I ever heard of. It certainly may secure all the	204:213,15C  !
4C	myrtle and turkey part of it."	204:213,16C  !
4B	"You intend to be very rich,"	204:213,17B  !
4C	"To be sure. Do not you? ~ Do not we all?"	204:213,19C  !
4B	"I cannot intend any thing which it must be so completely	204:213,20B  !
4B	beyond my power to command. Miss Crawford	204:213,21B  !
4B	may chuse her degree of wealth. She has only to fix on	204:213,22B  !
4B	her number of thousands a year, and there can be no	204:213,23B  !
4B	doubt of their coming. My intentions are only not to	204:213,24B  !
4B	be poor."	204:213,25B  !
4C	"By moderation and economy, and bringing down your	204:213,26C  !
4C	wants to your income, and all that. I understand you ~	204:213,27C  !
4C	and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of	204:213,28C  !
4C	life, with such limited means and indifferent connections.	204:213,29C  !
4C	~ What can \you\ want but a decent maintenance? You	204:213,30C  !
4C	have not much time before you; and your relations are	204:213,31C  !
4C	in no situation to do any thing for you, or to mortify you	204:213,32C  !
4C	by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence.	204:213,33C  !
4C	Be honest and poor, by all means ~ but I shall not envy	204:213,34C  !
4C	you; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I	204:213,35C  !
4C	have a much greater respect for those that are honest and	204:213,36C  !
4C	rich."	204:213,37C  !
4B	"Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is	204:213,38B  !
4B	precisely what I have no manner of concern with. I do	204:214, 1B  !
4B	not mean to be poor. Poverty is exactly what I have	204:214, 2B  !
4B	determined against. Honesty, in the something between,	204:214, 3B  !
4B	in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that	204:214, 4B  !
4B	I am anxious for your not looking down on."	204:214, 5B  !
4C	"But I do look down upon it, if it might have been	204:214, 6C  !
4C	higher. I must look down upon any thing contented	204:214, 7C  !
4C	with obscurity when it might rise to distinction."	204:214, 8C  !
4B	"But how may it rise? ~ How may my honesty at	204:214, 9B  !
4B	least rise to any distinction?"	204:214,10B  !
4C	"Oh|"	204:214,12C  !
4C	"You ought to be in parliament,	204:214,13C  !
4C	or you should have gone into the army ten years ago."	204:214,14C  !
4B	"\That\ is not much to the purpose now; and as to my	204:214,15B  !
4B	being in parliament, I believe I must wait till there is an	204:214,16B  !
4B	especial assembly for the representation of younger sons	204:214,17B  !
4B	who have little to live on. No, Miss Crawford,"	204:214,18B  !
4B	"there \are\ distinctions which I	204:214,19B  !

4B	chance ~ absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining ~	204:214,21B  !
4B	but they are of a different character."	204:214,22B  !
4A	"but she did not suppose	204:215,17A  !
4A	it would be in her power,"	204:215,18A  !
4F	"But why should Mrs% Grant ask Fanny?"	205:217, 1F  !
4F	"How came she to think of asking Fanny? ~	205:217, 2F  !
4F	Fanny never dines there, you know, in this sort of way.	205:217, 3F  !
4F	I cannot spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go.	205:217, 4F  !
4F	~ Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?"	205:217, 5F  !
4B	"If you put such a question to her,"	205:217, 6B  !
4B	"Fanny will immediately	205:217, 7B  !
4B	say, no; but I am sure, my dear mother, she	205:217, 8B  !
4B	would like to go; and I can see no reason why she should	205:217, 9B  !
4B	not."	205:217,10B  !
4F	"I cannot imagine why Mrs% Grant should think of	205:217,11F  !
4F	asking her. ~ She never did before. ~ She used to ask your	205:217,12F  !
4F	sisters now and then, but she never asked Fanny."	205:217,13F  !
4A	"If you cannot do without me, ma'am,"	205:217,14A  !
4B	"But my mother will have my father with her all the	205:217,16B  !
4B	evening."	205:217,17B  !
4F	"To be sure, so I shall."	205:217,18F  !
4B	"Suppose you take my father's opinion, ma'am."	205:217,19B  !
4F	"That's well thought of. So I will, Edmund. I will	205:217,20F  !
4F	ask Sir Thomas, as soon as he comes in, whether I can do	205:217,21F  !
4F	without her."	205:217,22F  !
4B	"As you please, ma'am, on that head; but I meant	205:217,23B  !
4B	my father's opinion as to the \propriety\ of the invitation's	205:217,24B  !
4B	being accepted or not; and I think he will consider it	205:217,25B  !
4B	a right thing by Mrs% Grant, as well as by Fanny, that	205:217,26B  !
4B	being the \first\ invitation it should be accepted."	205:217,27B  !
4F	"I do not know. We will ask him. But he will be	205:217,28F  !
4F	very much surprized that Mrs% Grant should ask Fanny	205:217,29F  !
4F	at all."	205:217,30F  !
4F	"Sir Thomas, stop a moment ~ I	205:218, 5F  !
4F	have something to say to you."	205:218, 6F  !
4F	"I have something to tell you that will	205:218,20F  !
4F	surprize you. Mrs% Grant has asked Fanny to dinner|"	205:218,21F  !
4E	"Well,"	205:218,22E  !
4F	"Edmund wants her to go. But how can I spare her?"	205:218,24F  !
4E	"She will be late,"	205:218,25E  !
4E	"but what is your difficulty?"	205:218,26E  !
4F	"So strange| for Mrs% Grant never used	205:218,29F  !
4F	to ask her."	205:218,30F  !
4B	"But is not it very natural,"	205:218,31B  !
4B	"that	205:218,31B  !
4B	Mrs% Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor	205:218,32B  !
4B	for her sister?"	205:218,33B  !
4E	"Nothing can be more natural,"	205:218,34E  !
4E	"nor, were there no sister in the	205:218,35E  !
4E	case, could any thing in my opinion be more natural.	205:218,36E  !
4E	Mrs% Grant's shewing civility to Miss Price, to	205:218,37E  !
4E	Lady Bertram's	205:218,37E  !
4E	niece, could never want explanation. The only	205:218,38E  !
4E	surprize I can feel is that this should be the \first\ time of	205:219, 1E  !
4E	its being paid. Fanny was perfectly right in giving only	205:219, 2E  !
4E	a conditional answer. She appears to feel as she ought.	205:219, 3E  !
4E	But as I conclude that she must wish to go, since all young	205:219, 4E  !
4E	people like to be together, I can see no reason why she	205:219, 5E  !
4E	should be denied the indulgence."	205:219, 6E  !
4F	"But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?"	205:219, 7F  !
4E	"Indeed I think you may."	205:219, 8E  !
4F	"She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is	205:219, 9F  !
4F	not here."	205:219,10F  !
4E	"Your sister perhaps may be prevailed on to spend	205:219,11E  !
4E	the day with us, and I shall certainly be at home."	205:219,12E  !
4F	"Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund."	205:219,13F  !
4B	"Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the	205:219,16B  !
4B	smallest hesitation on your uncle's side. He had but one	205:219,17B  !
4B	opinion. You are to go."	205:219,18B  !
4A	"Thank you, I am \so\ glad,"	205:219,19A  !
4A	"And yet, why should	205:219,21A  !
4A	I be glad? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something	205:219,22A  !
4A	there to pain me?"	205:219,23A  !
4J	"Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet	205:220, 1J  !
4J	with such attention and indulgence| You ought to be	205:220, 2J  !
4J	very much obliged to Mrs% Grant for thinking of you, and	205:220, 3J  !
4J	to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to look	205:220, 4J  !
4J	upon it as something extraordinary: for I hope you are	205:220, 5J  !
4J	aware that there is no real occasion for your going into	205:220, 6J  !
4J	company in this sort of way, or ever dining out at all; and	205:220, 7J  !
4J	it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated.	205:220, 8J  !
4J	Nor must you be fancying, that the invitation is meant as	205:220, 9J  !
4J	any particular compliment to \you\; the compliment is	205:220,10J  !
4J	intended to your uncle and aunt, and me. Mrs% Grant	205:220,11J  !
4J	thinks it a civility due to \us\ to take a little notice of you,	205:220,12J  !
4J	or	205:220,12J  !
4J	else it would never have come into her head, and you	205:220,13J  !
4J	may be very certain, that if your cousin Julia had been at	205:220,14J  !
4J	home, you would not have been asked at all."	205:220,15J  !
4J	"Oh| depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without	205:220,22J  !
4J	you, or you would not be allowed to go. \I\ shall be	205:220,23J  !
4J	here, so you may be quite easy about your aunt. And	205:220,24J  !
4J	I hope you will have a very \agreeable\ day and find it all	205:220,25J  !
4J	mighty \delightful\. But I must observe, that five is the	205:220,26J  !
4J	very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to	205:220,27J  !
4J	table; and I cannot but be surprized that such an \elegant\	205:220,28J  !
4J	lady as Mrs% Grant should not contrive better| And	205:220,29J  !
4J	round their enormous great wide table too, which fills up	205:220,30J  !
4J	the room so dreadfully| Had the Doctor been contented	205:220,31J  !
4J	to take my dining table when I came away, as any body	205:220,32J  !
4J	in their senses would have done, instead of having that	205:220,33J  !
4J	absurd new one of his own, which is wider, literally wider	205:220,34J  !
4J	than the dinner table here ~ how infinitely better it would	205:220,35J  !
4J	have been| and how much more he would have been	205:220,36J  !
4J	respected| for people are never respected when they step	205:220,37J  !
4J	out of their proper sphere. Remember \that\, Fanny.	205:220,38J  !
4J	Five, only five to be sitting round that table| However,	205:221, 1J  !
4J	you will have dinner enough on it for ten I dare say."	205:221, 2J  !
4J	"The nonsense and folly of people's stepping out of	205:221, 4J  !
4J	their rank and trying to appear above themselves, makes	205:221, 5J  !
4J	me think it right to give \you\ a hint, Fanny, now that you	205:221, 6J  !
4J	are going into company without any of us; and I do	205:221, 7J  !
4J	beseech and intreat you not to be putting yourself forward,	205:221, 8J  !
4J	and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of	205:221, 9J  !
4J	your cousins ~ as if you were dear Mrs% Rushworth or	205:221,10J  !
4J	Julia. \That\ will never do, believe me. Remember, wherever	205:221,11J  !
4J	you are, you must be the lowest and last; and though	205:221,12J  !
4J	Miss Crawford is in a manner at home, at the Parsonage,	205:221,13J  !
4J	you are not to be taking place of her. And as to coming	205:221,14J  !
4J	away at night, you are to stay just as long as Edmund	205:221,15J  !
4J	chuses. Leave him to settle \that\."	205:221,16J  !
4A	"Yes, ma'am, I should not think of any thing else."	205:221,17A  !
4J	"And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely,	205:221,18J  !
4J	for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in	205:221,19J  !
4J	my life ~ you must manage as well as you can, and not be	205:221,20J  !
4J	expecting the carriage to be sent for you. I certainly do	205:221,21J  !
4J	not go home to night, and, therefore, the carriage will not	205:221,22J  !
4J	be out on my account; so you must make up your mind to	205:221,23J  !
4J	what may happen, and take your things accordingly."	205:221,24J  !
4E	"Fanny, at what time would you have the	205:221,28E  !
4E	carriage come round?"	205:221,29E  !
4J	"My dear Sir Thomas|"	205:221,31J  !
4J	"Fanny can walk."	205:221,32J  !
4E	"Walk|"	205:221,33E  !
4E	"My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the	205:221,35E  !
4E	year| Will twenty minutes after four suit you?"	205:221,36E  !
4A	"Yes, sir,"	205:221,37A  !
4J	"Quite unnecessary| ~ a great deal too kind| But	205:222, 5J  !
4J	Edmund goes; ~ true ~ it is upon Edmund's account.	205:222, 6J  !
4J	I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night."	205:222, 7J  !
4B	"Now I must look at you, Fanny,"	205:222,19B  !
4B	"and tell you	205:222,20B  !
4B	how I like you; and as well as I can judge by this light,	205:222,21B  !
4B	you look very nicely indeed. What have you got on?"	205:222,22B  !
4A	"The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me	205:222,23A  !
4A	on my cousin's marriage. I hope it is not too fine; but	205:222,24A  !
4A	I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could, and that	205:222,25A  !
4A	I might not have such another opportunity all the winter.	205:222,26A  !
4A	I hope you do not think me too fine."	205:222,27A  !
4B	"A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white.	205:222,28B  !
4B	No, I see no finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly	205:222,29B  !
4B	proper. Your gown seems very pretty. I like these	205:222,30B  !
4B	glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown something	205:222,31B  !
4B	the same?"	205:222,32B  !
4B	"Hey day|"	205:222,35B  !
4B	"here's company, here's	205:222,35B  !
4B	a carriage| who have they got to meet us?"	205:222,36B  !
4B	"'Tis Crawford's, Crawford's	205:222,37B  !
4B	barouche, I protest| There are his own two men	205:222,38B  !
4B	pushing it back into its old quarters. He is here of course.	205:223, 1B  !
4B	This is quite a surprize, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see	205:223, 2B  !
4B	him."	205:223, 3B  !
4D	"So| Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton,	205:224,18D  !
4D	I understand ~ Happy man|"	205:224,19D  !
4C	"Yes, they have been there ~ about a fortnight,	205:224,20C  !
4C	Miss Price, have they not? ~ And Julia is with them."	205:224,21C  !
4D	"And Mr% Yates, I presume, is not far off."	205:224,22D  !
4C	"Mr% Yates| ~ Oh| we hear nothing of Mr% Yates. I do	205:224,23C  !
4C	not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park;	205:224,24C  !
4C	do you, Miss Price? ~ I think my friend Julia knows	205:224,25C  !
4C	better than to entertain her father with Mr% Yates."	205:224,26C  !
4D	"Poor Rushworth and his two-and-forty speeches|"	205:224,27D  !
4D	"Nobody can ever forget them.	205:224,28D  !
4D	Poor fellow| ~ I see him now; ~ his toil and his despair.	205:224,29D  !
4D	Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want	205:224,30D  !
4D	him to make two-and-forty speeches to her" ~	205:224,31D  !
4D	"She is too good for him ~	205:224,32D  !
4D	much too good."	205:224,33D  !
4D	"You	205:224,34D  !
4D	were Mr% Rushworth's best friend. Your kindness and	205:224,35D  !
4D	patience can never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience	205:224,36D  !
4D	in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part ~ in	205:224,37D  !
4D	trying to give him a brain which nature had denied ~ to	205:224,38D  !
4D	mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of	205:225, 1D  !
4D	your own| \He\ might not have sense enough himself to	205:225, 2D  !
4D	estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it	205:225, 3D  !
4D	had honour from all the rest of the party."	205:225, 4D  !
4D	"It is as a dream, a pleasant dream|"	205:225, 6D  !
4D	"I shall	205:225, 7D  !
4D	always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure.	205:225, 8D  !
4D	There was such an interest, such an animation, such a spirit	205:225, 9D  !
4D	diffused| Every body felt it. We were all alive. There	205:225,10D  !
4D	was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every hour of	205:225,11D  !
4D	the day. Always some little objection, some little doubt,	205:225,12D  !
4D	some little anxiety to be got over. I never was happier."	205:225,13D  !
4A	"Never happier| ~ never happier than when doing what	205:225,15A  !
4A	you must know was not justifiable| ~ never happier than	205:225,16A  !
4A	when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly| ~ Oh|	205:225,17A  !
4A	what a corrupted mind|"	205:225,18A  !
4D	"We were unlucky, Miss Price,"	205:225,19D  !
4D	"we certainly were	205:225,21D  !
4D	very unlucky. Another week, only one other week, would	205:225,22D  !
4D	have been enough for us. I think if we had had the disposal	205:225,23D  !
4D	of events ~ if Mansfield Park had had the government of	205:225,24D  !
4D	the winds just for a week or two about the equinox, there	205:225,25D  !
4D	would have been a difference. Not that we would have	205:225,26D  !
4D	endangered his safety by any tremendous weather ~ but only	205:225,27D  !
4D	by a steady contrary wind, or a calm. I think, Miss Price,	205:225,28D  !
4D	we would have indulged ourselves with a week's calm in	205:225,29D  !
4D	the Atlantic at that season."	205:225,30D  !
4A	"As far as \I\ am concerned, sir, I would not have delayed	205:225,33A  !
4A	his return for a day. My uncle disapproved it all so	205:225,34A  !
4A	entirely when he did arrive, that in my opinion, every thing	205:225,35A  !
4A	had gone quite far enough."	205:225,36A  !
4D	"I believe you are	205:226, 4D  !
4D	right. It was more pleasant than prudent. We were getting	205:226, 5D  !

4D	"how to make money ~ how to turn a good income into	205:226,14D  !
4D	a better. Dr% Grant is giving Bertram instructions about	205:226,15D  !
4D	the living he is to step into so soon. I find he takes orders	205:226,16D  !
4D	in a few weeks. They were at it in the dining-parlour.	205:226,17D  !
4D	I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He will have	205:226,18D  !
4D	a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with, and	205:226,19D  !
4D	earned without much trouble. I apprehend he will not	205:226,20D  !
4D	have less than seven hundred a year. Seven hundred	205:226,21D  !
4D	a year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of	205:226,22D  !

4D	Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even	205:226,34D  !

4D	\that\ would be exercise only to my body, and I must take	206:229,13D  !

4D	indulgence, without the wholesome alloy of labour, and	206:229,15D  !
4D	I do not like to eat the bread of idleness. No, my plan is to	206:229,16D  !

4D	a different creature from what she was in the autumn.	206:229,27D  !
4D	She was then merely a quiet, modest, not plain looking girl,	206:229,28D  !

4D	neither complexion nor countenance; but in that soft skin	206:229,30D  !
4D	of her's, so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday,	206:229,31D  !
4D	there is decided beauty; and from what I observed of	206:229,32D  !
4D	her eyes and mouth, I do not despair of their being capable	206:230, 1D  !
4D	of expression enough when she has any thing to express.	206:230, 2D  !
4D	And then ~ her air, her manner, her tout ensemble is so	206:230, 3D  !
4D	indescribably improved| She must be grown two inches,	206:230, 4D  !
4D	at least, since October."	206:230, 5D  !
4C	"Phoo| phoo| This is only because there were no tall	206:230, 6C  !
4C	women to compare her with, and because she has got a new	206:230, 7C  !
4C	gown, and you never saw her so well dressed before. She is	206:230, 8C  !
4C	just what she was in October, believe me. The truth is,	206:230, 9C  !
4C	that she was the only girl in company for you to notice, and	206:230,10C  !
4C	you must have a somebody. I have always thought her	206:230,11C  !
4C	pretty ~ not strikingly pretty ~ but ""pretty enough"" as	206:230,12C  !
4C	people say; a sort of beauty that grows on one. Her eyes	206:230,13C  !
4C	should be darker, but she has a sweet smile; but as for	206:230,14C  !
4C	this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may	206:230,15C  !
4C	all be resolved into a better style of dress and your having	206:230,16C  !
4C	nobody else to look at; and therefore, if you do set about	206:230,17C  !
4C	a flirtation with her, you never will persuade me that it is	206:230,18C  !
4C	in compliment to her beauty, or that it proceeds from any thing	206:230,19C  !

4D	character? ~ Is she solemn? ~ Is she queer? ~ Is she	206:230,25D  !
4D	prudish? Why did she draw back and look so grave	206:230,26D  !

4D	a girl who looked so grave on me| I must try to get	206:230,30D  !
4D	the better of this. Her looks say, ""I will not like you,	206:230,31D  !

4C	her such a soft skin and makes her so much taller, and	206:230,35C  !
4C	produces all these charms and graces| I do desire that	206:230,36C  !
4C	you will not be making her really unhappy; a \little\ love	206:230,37C  !
4C	perhaps may animate and do her good, but I will not	206:230,38C  !

4D	my way after passing that old farm house, with the yew	207:241, 5D  !
4D	trees, because I can never bear to ask; but I have not	207:241, 6D  !
4D	told you that with my usual luck ~ for I never do wrong	207:241, 7D  !
4D	without gaining by it ~ I found myself in due time in the	207:241, 8D  !
4D	very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was suddenly,	207:241, 9D  !
4D	upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the	207:241,10D  !
4D	midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills;	207:241,11D  !
4D	a small stream before me to be forded, a church standing	207:241,12D  !
4D	on a sort of knoll to my right ~ which church was strikingly	207:241,13D  !
4D	large and handsome for the place, and not a gentleman	207:241,14D  !
4D	or half a gentleman's house to be seen excepting	207:241,15D  !
4D	one ~ to be presumed the Parsonage, within a stone's	207:241,16D  !
4D	throw of the said knoll and church. I found myself in	207:241,17D  !
4D	short in Thornton Lacey."	207:241,18D  !
4B	"It sounds like it,"	207:241,19B  !
4B	"but which way	207:241,19B  !
4B	did you turn after passing Sewell's farm?"	207:241,20B  !
4D	"I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions;	207:241,21D  !
4D	though were I to answer all that you could put in the	207:241,22D  !
4D	course of an hour, you would never be able to prove that	207:241,23D  !
4D	it was \not\ Thornton Lacey ~ for such it certainly was."	207:241,24D  !
4B	"You inquired then?"	207:241,25B  !
4D	"No, I never inquire. But I \told\ a man mending	207:241,26D  !
4D	a hedge that it was Thornton Lacey, and he agreed to it."	207:241,27D  !
4B	"You have a good memory. I had forgotten having	207:241,28B  !
4B	ever told you half so much of the place."	207:241,29B  !
4B	"Well"	207:241,33B  !
4B	"and how did you like	207:241,33B  !
4B	what you saw?"	207:241,34B  !
4D	"Very much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There	207:241,35D  !
4D	will be work for five summers at least before the place is	207:241,36D  !
4D	live-able."	207:241,37D  !
4B	"No, no, not so bad as that. The farm-yard must be	207:241,38B  !
4B	moved, I grant you; but I am not aware of any thing	207:242, 1B  !
4B	else. The house is by no means bad, and when the yard	207:242, 2B  !
4B	is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach	207:242, 3B  !
4B	to it."	207:242, 4B  !
4D	"The farm-yard must be cleared away entirely, and	207:242, 5D  !
4D	planted up to shut out the blacksmith's shop. The house	207:242, 6D  !
4D	must be turned to front the east instead of the north ~ the	207:242, 7D  !
4D	entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be on that	207:242, 8D  !
4D	side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it	207:242, 9D  !
4D	may be done. And \there\ must be your approach ~	207:242,10D  !
4D	through what is at present the garden. You must make	207:242,11D  !
4D	you a new garden at what is now the back of the house;	207:242,12D  !
4D	which will be giving it the best aspect in the world ~	207:242,13D  !
4D	sloping to the south-east. The ground seems precisely	207:242,14D  !
4D	formed for it. I rode fifty yards up the lane between	207:242,15D  !
4D	the church and the house in order to look about me;	207:242,16D  !
4D	and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier.	207:242,17D  !
4D	The meadows beyond what \will\ \be\ the garden, as well as	207:242,18D  !
4D	what now \is\, sweeping round from the lane I stood in to	207:242,19D  !
4D	the north-east, that is, to the principal road through the	207:242,20D  !
4D	village, must be all laid together of course; very pretty	207:242,21D  !
4D	meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber. They	207:242,22D  !
4D	belong to the living, I suppose. If not, you must purchase	207:242,23D  !
4D	them. Then the stream ~ something must be done	207:242,24D  !
4D	with the stream; but I could not quite determine what.	207:242,25D  !
4D	I had two or three ideas."	207:242,26D  !
4B	"And I have two or three ideas also,"	207:242,27B  !
4B	"and one of them is that very little of your plan for	207:242,28B  !
4B	Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice. I must be	207:242,29B  !
4B	satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. I think	207:242,30B  !
4B	the house and premises may be made comfortable, and	207:242,31B  !
4B	given the air of a gentleman's residence without any very	207:242,32B  !
4B	heavy expense, and that must suffice me; and I hope	207:242,33B  !
4B	may suffice all who care about me."	207:242,34B  !
4C	"There, I will stake my	207:243, 1C  !
4C	last like a woman of spirit. No cold prudence for me.	207:243, 2C  !
4C	I am not born to sit still and do nothing. If I lose the	207:243, 3C  !
4C	game, it shall not be from not striving for it."	207:243, 4C  !
4D	"My plan may not be the best possible; I had not	207:243, 8D  !
4D	many minutes to form it in: but you must do a good	207:243, 9D  !
4D	deal. The place deserves it, and you will find yourself	207:243,10D  !
4D	not satisfied with much less than it is capable of. ~	207:243,11D  !
4D	(Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards.	207:243,12D  !
4D	There, let them lie just before you.) The place deserves	207:243,13D  !
4D	it, Bertram. You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman's	207:243,14D  !
4D	residence. \That\ will be done, by the removal of	207:243,15D  !
4D	the farm-yard, for independent of that terrible nuisance,	207:243,16D  !
4D	I never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so	207:243,17D  !
4D	much the air of a gentleman's residence, so much the look	207:243,18D  !
4D	of a something above a mere Parsonage House, above	207:243,19D  !
4D	the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is not	207:243,20D  !
4D	a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as	207:243,21D  !
4D	many roofs as windows ~ it is not cramped into the	207:243,22D  !
4D	vulgar compactness of a square farm-house ~ it is a solid	207:243,23D  !
4D	walled, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as one	207:243,24D  !
4D	might suppose a respectable old country family had lived	207:243,25D  !
4D	in from generation to generation, through two centuries	207:243,26D  !
4D	at least, and were now spending from two to three	207:243,27D  !
4D	thousand a year in."	207:243,28D  !
4D	"The air of a gentleman's	207:243,29D  !
4D	residence, therefore, you cannot but give it, if you do	207:243,30D  !
4D	any thing. But it is capable of much more. (Let me	207:243,31D  !
4D	see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that queen;	207:243,32D  !
4D	no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram	207:243,33D  !
4D	does \not\ bid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it.	207:243,34D  !
4D	Go on, go on.) By some such improvements as I have	207:243,35D  !
4D	suggested, (I do not really require you to proceed upon	207:243,36D  !
4D	my plan, though by the bye I doubt any body's striking	207:243,37D  !
4D	out a better) ~ you may give it a higher character. You	207:243,38D  !
4D	may raise it into a \place\. From being the mere gentleman's	207:244, 1D  !
4D	residence, it becomes, by judicious improvement,	207:244, 2D  !
4D	the residence of a man of education, taste, modern manners,	207:244, 3D  !
4D	good connections. All this may be stamped on it;	207:244, 4D  !
4D	and that house receive such an air as to make its owner	207:244, 5D  !
4D	be set down as the great land-holder of the parish, by	207:244, 6D  !
4D	every creature travelling the road; especially as there	207:244, 7D  !
4D	is no real squire's house to dispute the point; a circumstance	207:244, 8D  !
4D	between ourselves to enhance the value of such	207:244, 9D  !

4D	bought her too dearly, and your brother does not offer	207:244,19D  !
4D	half her value. No, no, sir, hands off ~ hands off. Your	207:244,20D  !
4D	sister does not part with the queen. She is quite determined.	207:244,21D  !
4D	The game will be yours,	207:244,22D  !
4D	it will certainly be yours."	207:244,23D  !
4B	"And Fanny had much rather it were William's,"	207:244,24B  !
4B	"Poor Fanny| not	207:244,25B  !
4B	allowed to cheat herself as she wishes|"	207:244,26B  !
4C	"Mr% Bertram,"	207:244,27C  !
4C	"you know Henry to be such a capital	207:244,28C  !
4C	improver, that you cannot possibly engage in any thing	207:244,29C  !
4C	of the sort at Thornton Lacey, without accepting his	207:244,30C  !
4C	help. Only think how useful he was at Sotherton|	207:244,31C  !
4C	Only think what grand things were produced there by	207:244,32C  !
4C	our all going with him one hot day in August to drive	207:244,33C  !
4C	about the grounds, and see his genius take fire. There	207:244,34C  !
4C	we went, and there we came home again; and what was	207:244,35C  !
4C	done there is not to be told|"	207:244,36C  !
4D	"I cannot say there was	207:245, 3D  !
4D	much done at Sotherton; but it was a hot day, and we	207:245, 4D  !
4D	were all walking after each other and bewildered."	207:245, 5D  !
4D	"I should be sorry to	207:245, 7D  !
4D	have my powers of \planning\ judged of by the day at	207:245, 8D  !
4D	Sotherton. I see things very differently now. Do not	207:245, 9D  !
4D	think of me as I appeared then."	207:245,10D  !
4J	"Sotherton| Yes, that is a place	207:245,15J  !
4J	indeed, and we had a charming day there. William,	207:245,16J  !
4J	you are quite out of luck; but the next time you come	207:245,17J  !
4J	I hope dear Mr% and Mrs% Rushworth will be at	207:245,18J  !
4J	home,	207:245,18J  !
4J	and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received	207:245,19J  !
4J	by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their	207:245,20J  !
4J	relations, and Mr% Rushworth is a most amiable man.	207:245,21J  !
4J	They are at Brighton now, you know ~ in one of the best	207:245,22J  !
4J	houses there, as Mr% Rushworth's fine fortune gives them	207:245,23J  !
4J	a right to be. I do not exactly know the distance, but	207:245,24J  !
4J	when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not very far off,	207:245,25J  !
4J	you ought to go over and pay your respects to them;	207:245,26J  !
4J	and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get	207:245,27J  !
4J	conveyed to your cousins."	207:245,28J  !
4E	"I do not advise	207:245,35E  !
4E	your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may soon	207:245,36E  !
4E	have more convenient opportunities of meeting, but my	207:245,37E  !
4E	daughters would be happy to see their cousins any where;	207:245,38E  !
4E	and you will find Mr% Rushworth most sincerely	207:246, 1E  !
4E	disposed to regard all the connections of our family as	207:246, 2E  !
4E	his own."	207:246, 3E  !
4D	"I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you	207:247, 8D  !
4D	have perhaps heard me telling Miss Price. May I hope	207:247, 9D  !
4D	for your acquiescence and for your not influencing your	207:247,10D  !
4D	son against such a tenant?"	207:247,11D  !
4E	"It is the only	207:247,12E  !
4E	way, sir, in which I could \not\ wish you established as	207:247,13E  !
4E	a permanent neighbour; but I hope, and believe, that	207:247,14E  !
4E	Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey.	207:247,15E  !
4E	Edmund, am I saying too much?"	207:247,16E  !
4B	"Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But	207:247,20B  !
4B	Crawford, though I refuse you as a tenant, come to me	207:247,21B  !
4B	as a friend. Consider the house as half your own every	207:247,22B  !
4B	winter, and we will add to the stables on your own	207:247,23B  !
4B	improved plan, and with all the improvements of your	207:247,24B  !
4B	improved plan that may occur to you this spring."	207:247,25B  !
4E	"We shall be the losers,"	207:247,26E  !
4E	"His going, though only eight miles, will be an unwelcome	207:247,27E  !
4E	contraction of our family circle; but I	207:247,28E  !
4E	should have been deeply mortified, if any son of mine	207:247,29E  !
4E	could reconcile himself to doing less. It is perfectly	207:247,30E  !
4E	natural that you should not have thought much on the	207:247,31E  !
4E	subject, Mr% Crawford. But a parish has wants and	207:247,32E  !
4E	claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly	207:247,33E  !
4E	resident, and which no proxy can be capable of	207:247,34E  !
4E	satisfying to the same extent. Edmund might, in the	207:247,35E  !
4E	common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he	207:247,36E  !
4E	might read prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park;	207:247,37E  !
4E	he might ride over, every Sunday, to a house	207:247,38E  !
4E	nominally inhabited, and go through divine service; he	207:248, 1E  !
4E	might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh	207:248, 2E  !
4E	day, for three or four hours, if that would content him.	207:248, 3E  !
4E	But it will not. He knows that human nature needs	207:248, 4E  !
4E	more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey, and that	207:248, 5E  !
4E	if he does not live among his parishioners and prove	207:248, 6E  !
4E	himself by constant attention their well-wisher and	207:248, 7E  !
4E	friend, he does very little either for their good or his own."	207:248, 8E  !
4E	"I repeat again,"	207:248,10E  !
4E	"that Thornton Lacey	207:248,10E  !
4E	is the only house in the neighbourhood in which	207:248,11E  !
4E	I should \not\ be happy to wait on Mr% Crawford as occupier."	207:248,12E  !
4B	"Sir Thomas,"	207:248,14B  !
4B	"undoubtedly understands	207:248,14B  !
4B	the duty of a parish priest. ~ We must hope his	207:248,15B  !
4B	son may prove that \he\ knows it too."	207:248,16B  !
4A	"But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?"	207:249,15A  !
4A	"Oh| shame, shame| ~ But never mind it, William.	207:249,26A  !
4A	It is not worth minding. It is no reflection on \you\; it is	207:249,28A  !
4A	no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced,	207:249,29A  !
4A	more or less, in their time. You must think of	207:249,30A  !
4A	that; you must try to make up your mind to it as one	207:249,31A  !
4A	of the hardships which fall to every sailor's share ~ like	207:249,32A  !
4A	bad weather and hard living ~ only with this advantage,	207:249,33A  !
4A	that there will be an end to it, that there will come a time	207:249,34A  !
4A	when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When	207:249,35A  !
4A	you are a lieutenant| ~ only think, William, when you	207:249,36A  !
4A	are a lieutenant, how little you will care for any nonsense	207:249,37A  !
4A	of this kind."	207:249,38A  !
4A	"Oh| my dear William, do not talk so, do not be	207:250, 3A  !
4A	so desponding. My uncle says nothing, but I am sure	207:250, 4A  !
4A	he will do every thing in his power to get you made.	207:250, 5A  !
4A	He knows, as well as you do, of what consequence	207:250, 6A  !
4A	it is."	207:250, 7A  !
4A	"Yes, very; ~ only I am soon tired."	207:250,12A  !
4E	"I am sorry to say	207:250,28E  !
4E	that I am unable to answer your question. I have never	207:250,29E  !
4E	seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl; but I trust	207:250,30E  !
4E	we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman	207:250,31E  !
4E	when we do see her, which perhaps we may have	207:250,32E  !
4E	an opportunity of doing ere long."	207:250,33E  !
4D	"I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance,	207:250,34D  !
4D	Mr% Price,"	207:250,35D  !
4D	"and	207:250,35D  !
4D	will engage to answer every inquiry which you can	207:250,36D  !
4D	make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction. But	207:250,37D  !
4D	I believe	207:250,38D  !
4D	it must be at	207:250,38D  !
4D	some other time. There is \one\ person in company who	207:251, 1D  !
4D	does not like to have Miss Price spoken of."	207:251, 2D  !
4J	"Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about? We	207:251,18J  !
4J	are going. Do not you see your aunt is going? Quick,	207:251,19J  !
4J	quick. I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting.	207:251,20J  !
4J	You should always remember the coachman and horses.	207:251,21J  !
4J	My dear Sir Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage	207:251,22J  !
4J	should come back for you, and Edmund, and William."	207:251,23J  !
4E	"I do not like, William,	208:252,11E  !
4E	that you should leave Northamptonshire without this	208:252,12E  !
4E	indulgence. It would give me pleasure to see you both	208:252,13E  !
4E	dance. You spoke of the balls at Northampton. Your	208:252,14E  !
4E	cousins have occasionally attended them; but they	208:252,15E  !
4E	would not altogether suit us now. The fatigue would be	208:252,16E  !
4E	too much for your aunt. I believe, we must not think	208:252,17E  !
4E	of a Northampton ball. A dance at home would be more	208:252,18E  !
4E	eligible, and if" ~	208:252,19E  !
4J	"Ah| my dear Sir Thomas,"	208:252,20J  !
4J	"I knew what was coming. I knew what you were going	208:252,21J  !
4J	to say. If dear Julia were at home, or dearest Mrs% Rushworth	208:252,22J  !
4J	at Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasion for	208:252,23J  !
4J	such a thing, you would be tempted to give the young	208:252,24J  !
4J	people a dance at Mansfield. I know you would. If	208:252,25J  !
4J	\they\ were at home to grace the ball, a ball you would have	208:252,26J  !
4J	this very Christmas. Thank your uncle, William, thank	208:252,27J  !
4J	your uncle."	208:252,28J  !
4E	"My daughters,"	208:252,29E  !

4E	are very happy; but the dance which I think of giving	208:252,31E  !
4E	at Mansfield, will be for their cousins. Could we be all	208:252,32E  !
4E	assembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more	208:253, 1E  !
4E	complete, but the absence of some is not to debar the	208:253, 2E  !

4C	necklace?"	208:257,32C  !
4C	"Shall not you wear	208:257,32C  !
4C	your brother's cross?"	208:257,33C  !
4C	"You see what a collection I have,"	208:258, 9C  !
4C	"more	208:258, 9C  !
4C	by half than I ever use or think of. I do not offer them	208:258,10C  !
4C	as new. I offer nothing but an old necklace. You must	208:258,11C  !
4C	forgive the liberty and oblige me."	208:258,12C  !
4A	"When I wear this necklace I	208:258,38A  !
4A	shall always think of you,"	208:259, 1A  !

4C	that necklace,"	208:259, 4C  !
4C	"You must think	208:259, 4C  !
4C	of Henry, for it was his choice in the first place. He gave	208:259, 5C  !
4C	it to me, and with the necklace I make over to you all	208:259, 6C  !
4C	the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to be	208:259, 7C  !
4C	a family remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your	208:259, 8C  !
4C	mind without bringing the brother too."	208:259, 9C  !
4C	"My dear child,"	208:259,18C  !
4C	"what are you	208:259,18C  !

4C	as mine, and fancy you did not come honestly by it? ~	208:259,20C  !
4C	or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by	208:259,21C  !
4C	seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his	208:259,22C  !
4C	money purchased three years ago, before he knew there	208:259,23C  !
4C	was such a throat in the world? ~ or perhaps ~	208:259,24C  !
4C	you suspect a confederacy between us, and that	208:259,25C  !
4C	what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his	208:259,26C  !
4C	desire?"	208:259,27C  !
4C	"Well then,"	208:259,30C  !
4C	"to convince me that you	208:259,31C  !
4C	suspect no trick, and are as unsuspicious of compliment	208:259,32C  !
4C	as I have always found you, take the necklace, and say	208:259,33C  !
4C	no more about it. Its being a gift of my brother's need	208:259,34C  !
4C	not make the smallest difference in your accepting it, as	208:259,35C  !
4C	I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with	208:259,36C  !
4C	it. He is always giving me something or other. I have	208:259,37C  !
4C	such innumerable presents from him that it is quite	208:259,38C  !
4C	impossible for me to value, or for him to remember half.	208:260, 1C  !
4C	And as for this necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it	208:260, 2C  !
4C	six times; it is very pretty ~ but I never think of it; and	208:260, 3C  !
4C	though you would be most heartily welcome to any other	208:260, 4C  !
4C	in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on the very	208:260, 5C  !
4C	one which, if I have a choice, I would rather part with	208:260, 6C  !
4C	and see in your possession than any other. Say no more	208:260, 7C  !
4C	against it, I entreat you. Such a trifle is not worth half	208:260, 8C  !
4C	so many words."	208:260, 9C  !
4B	"Fanny,"	209:261, 9B  !
4B	"I beg your	209:261,10B  !
4B	pardon for being here. I came to look for you, and after	209:261,11B  !
4B	waiting a little while in hope of your coming in, was making	209:261,12B  !
4B	use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You will	209:261,13B  !
4B	find the beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now	209:261,14B  !
4B	speak my business, which is merely to beg your acceptance	209:261,15B  !
4B	of this little trifle ~ a chain for William's cross. You	209:261,16B  !
4B	ought to have had it a week ago, but there has been a	209:261,17B  !
4B	delay from my brother's not being in town by several days	209:261,18B  !
4B	so soon as I expected; and I have only just now received	209:261,19B  !
4B	it at Northampton. I hope you will like the chain itself,	209:261,20B  !
4B	Fanny. I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your	209:261,21B  !
4B	taste, but at any rate I know you will be kind to my	209:261,22B  !
4B	intentions,	209:261,22B  !
4B	and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love	209:261,23B  !
4B	of one of your oldest friends."	209:261,24B  !
4A	"Oh| cousin, stop a moment,	209:261,28A  !
4A	pray stop."	209:261,29A  !
4A	"I cannot attempt to thank you,"	209:261,31A  !
4A	"thanks are out of the question.	209:261,32A  !
4A	I feel much more than I can possibly express. Your	209:262, 1A  !
4A	goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond" ~	209:262, 2A  !
4B	"If this is all you have to say, Fanny,"	209:262, 3B  !
4A	"No, no, it is not. I want to consult you."	209:262, 5A  !
4A	"Oh| this is beautiful indeed| this is the	209:262,10A  !
4A	very thing, precisely what I wished for| this is the only	209:262,11A  !
4A	ornament I have ever had a desire to possess. It will	209:262,12A  !
4A	exactly suit my cross. They must and shall be worn	209:262,13A  !
4A	together. It comes too in such an acceptable moment.	209:262,14A  !
4A	Oh| cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is."	209:262,15A  !
4B	"My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too	209:262,16B  !
4B	much. I am most happy that you like the chain, and	209:262,17B  !
4B	that it should be here in time for to-morrow: but your	209:262,18B  !
4B	thanks are far beyond the occasion. Believe me, I have	209:262,19B  !
4B	no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing	209:262,20B  !
4B	to yours. No, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so	209:262,21B  !
4B	complete, so unalloyed. It is without a drawback."	209:262,22B  !
4B	"But what is it	209:262,26B  !
4B	that you want to consult me about?"	209:262,27B  !
4B	"Return the necklace| No, my dear Fanny, upon no	209:263, 5B  !
4B	account. It would be mortifying her severely. There	209:263, 6B  !
4B	can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having	209:263, 7B  !
4B	any thing returned on our hands, which we have given	209:263, 8B  !
4B	with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort	209:263, 9B  !
4B	of a friend. Why should she lose a pleasure which she	209:263,10B  !
4B	has shewn herself so deserving of?"	209:263,11B  !
4A	"If it had been given to me in the first instance,"	209:263,12A  !
4A	"I should not have thought of returning it; but	209:263,13A  !
4A	being her brother's present, is not it fair to suppose that	209:263,14A  !
4A	she would rather not part with it, when it is not wanted?"	209:263,15A  !
4B	"She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable	209:263,16B  !
4B	at least; and its having been originally her brother's gift	209:263,17B  !
4B	makes no difference, for as she was not prevented from	209:263,18B  !
4B	offering, nor you from taking it on that account, it ought	209:263,19B  !
4B	not to affect your keeping it. No doubt it is handsomer	209:263,20B  !
4B	than mine, and fitter for a ball-room."	209:263,21B  !
4A	"No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its	209:263,22A  !
4A	way, and for my purpose not half so fit. The chain will	209:263,23A  !
4A	agree with William's cross beyond all comparison better	209:263,24A  !
4A	than the necklace."	209:263,25A  !
4B	"For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it \be\ a	209:263,26B  !
4B	sacrifice ~ I am sure you will, upon consideration, make	209:263,27B  !
4B	that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been	209:263,28B  !
4B	so studious of your comfort. Miss Crawford's attentions	209:263,29B  !
4B	to you have been ~ not more than you were justly entitled	209:263,30B  !
4B	to ~ I am the last person to think that \could\ \be\ ~ but	209:263,31B  !
4B	they	209:263,31B  !
4B	have been invariable; and to be returning them with	209:263,32B  !
4B	what must have something the \air\ of ingratitude, though	209:263,33B  !
4B	I know it could never have the \meaning\, is not in your	209:263,34B  !
4B	nature I am sure. Wear the necklace, as you are engaged	209:263,35B  !
4B	to do to-morrow evening, and let the chain, which was	209:263,36B  !
4B	not ordered with any reference to the ball, be kept for	209:263,37B  !
4B	commoner occasions. This is my advice. I would not	209:263,38B  !
4B	have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose	209:264, 1B  !
4B	intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure,	209:264, 2B  !
4B	and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance	209:264, 3B  !
4B	in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make	209:264, 4B  !
4B	the few slight differences, resulting principally from situation,	209:264, 5B  !
4B	no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship. I	209:264, 6B  !
4B	would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,"	209:264, 7B  !
4B	"between the two	209:264, 8B  !
4B	dearest objects I have on earth."	209:264, 9B  !

4B	"Fanny,"	209:267,34B  !
4B	"You look	209:267,37B  !
4B	tired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far."	209:267,38B  !
4A	"No, I have not been out at all."	209:268, 1A  !
4B	"Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are	209:268, 2B  !
4B	worse. You had better have gone out."	209:268, 3B  !
4B	"I come from Dr% Grant's,"	209:268,11B  !
4B	"You may guess my errand there, Fanny."	209:268,12B  !
4B	"I wished	209:268,14B  !
4B	to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances,"	209:268,15B  !
4B	"Yes,"	209:268,19B  !
4B	"she is engaged to me; but	209:268,19B  !
4B	she says it is to be the last	209:268,20B  !
4B	time that she ever will dance with me. She is not serious.	209:268,21B  !
4B	I think, I hope, I am sure she is not serious ~ but I would	209:268,22B  !
4B	rather not hear it. She never has danced with a clergyman	209:268,23B  !
4B	she says, and she never \will\. For my own sake, I	209:268,24B  !
4B	could wish there had been no ball just at ~ I mean not	209:268,25B  !
4B	this very week, this very day ~ to-morrow I leave home."	209:268,26B  !
4A	"I am very sorry	209:268,27A  !
4A	that any thing has occurred to distress you. This ought	209:268,28A  !
4A	to be a day of pleasure. My uncle meant it so."	209:268,29A  !
4B	"Oh| yes, yes, and it will be a day of pleasure. It	209:268,30B  !
4B	will all end right. I am only vexed for a moment. In	209:268,31B  !
4B	fact, it is not that I consider the ball as ill-timed; ~ what	209:268,32B  !
4B	does it signify? But, Fanny," ~	209:268,33B  !
4B	"you know	209:268,34B  !
4B	what all this means. You see how it is; and could tell	209:268,35B  !
4B	me, perhaps better than I could tell you, how and why	209:268,36B  !
4B	I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little. You are a kind,	209:268,37B  !
4B	kind listener. I have been pained by her manner this	209:268,38B  !
4B	morning, and cannot get the better of it. I know her	209:269, 1B  !
4B	disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own, but	209:269, 2B  !
4B	the influence of her former companions makes her seem,	209:269, 3B  !
4B	gives to her conversation, to her professed opinions, sometimes	209:269, 4B  !
4B	a tinge of wrong. She does not \think\ evil, but she	209:269, 5B  !
4B	speaks it ~ speaks it in playfulness ~ and though I know	209:269, 6B  !
4B	it to be playfulness, it grieves me to the soul."	209:269, 7B  !
4A	"The effect of education,"	209:269, 8A  !
4B	"Yes, that uncle	209:269, 9B  !
4B	and aunt| They have injured the finest mind| ~ for	209:269,10B  !
4B	sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it does appear more than	209:269,11B  !
4B	manner; it appears as if the mind itself was tainted."	209:269,12B  !
4A	"If	209:269,14A  !
4A	you only want me as a listener, cousin, I will be as useful	209:269,15A  !
4A	as I can; but I am not qualified for an adviser. Do not	209:269,16A  !
4A	ask advice of \me\. I am not competent."	209:269,17A  !
4B	"You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an	209:269,18B  !
4B	office, but you need not be afraid. It is a subject on	209:269,19B  !
4B	which I should never ask advice. It is the sort of subject on	209:269,20B  !
4B	which it had better never be asked; and few I imagine	209:269,21B  !
4B	do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against	209:269,22B  !
4B	their conscience. I only want to talk to you."	209:269,23B  !
4A	"One thing more. Excuse the liberty ~ but take care	209:269,24A  !
4A	\how\ you talk to me. Do not tell me any thing now,	209:269,25A  !
4A	which hereafter you may be sorry for. The time may	209:269,26A  !
4A	come ~"	209:269,27A  !
4B	"Dearest Fanny|"	209:269,29B  !
4B	"you are all considerate thought| ~	209:269,31B  !
4B	But it is unnecessary here. The time will never come.	209:269,32B  !
4B	No such time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to	209:269,33B  !
4B	think it most improbable; the chances grow less and less.	209:269,34B  !
4B	And even if it should ~ there will be nothing to be remembered	209:269,35B  !
4B	by either you or me, that we need be afraid of, for	209:269,36B  !
4B	I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if they	209:269,37B  !
4B	are removed, it must be by changes that will only raise	209:269,38B  !
4B	her character the more by the recollection of the faults	209:270, 1B  !
4B	she once had. You are the only being upon earth to	209:270, 2B  !
4B	whom I should say what I have said; but you have	209:270, 3B  !
4B	always known my opinion of her; you can bear me	209:270, 4B  !
4B	witness, Fanny, that I have never been blinded. How	209:270, 5B  !
4B	many a time have we talked over her little errors| You	209:270, 6B  !
4B	need not fear me. I have almost given up every serious	209:270, 7B  !
4B	idea of her; but I must be a blockhead indeed if, whatever	209:270, 8B  !
4B	befell me, I could think of your kindness and sympathy	209:270, 9B  !
4B	without the sincerest gratitude."	209:270,10B  !
4A	"Yes, cousin, I am convinced that \you\ would	209:270,14A  !
4A	be incapable of any thing else, though perhaps some might	209:270,15A  !
4A	not. I cannot be afraid of hearing any thing you wish	209:270,16A  !
4A	to say. Do not check yourself. Tell me whatever you	209:270,17A  !
4A	like."	209:270,18A  !
4F	"Yes,"	210:272, 9F  !
4F	"she looks very well. I	210:272, 9F  !
4F	sent Chapman to her."	210:272,10F  !
4J	"Look well| Oh yes,"	210:272,11J  !
4J	"she has	210:272,11J  !
4J	good reason to look well with all her advantages: brought	210:272,12J  !
4J	up in this family as she has been, with all the benefit of	210:272,13J  !
4J	her cousins' manners before her. Only think, my dear	210:272,14J  !
4J	Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I	210:272,15J  !
4J	have been the means of giving her. The very gown you	210:272,16J  !
4J	have been taking notice of, is your own generous present	210:272,17J  !
4J	to her when dear Mrs% Rushworth married. What would	210:272,18J  !
4J	she have been if we had not taken her by the hand?"	210:272,19J  !
4B	"You must	210:272,28B  !

4B	me; any two that you like, except the first."	210:272,30B  !
4C	"Did he?	210:274,37C  !
4C	Did Edmund? That was like himself. No other man	210:274,38C  !
4C	would have thought of it. I honour him beyond expression."	210:275, 1C  !
4A	"Yes, sir, to Mr% Crawford,"	210:275,14A  !
4E	"It must be so, my dear,"	210:275,31E  !
4F	"Yes, she does look very well,"	210:277, 6F  !
4F	"Chapman helped her dress. I sent Chapman	210:277, 7F  !
4F	to her."	210:277, 8F  !
4C	"Ah| ma'am, how much we	210:277,14C  !
4C	want dear Mrs% Rushworth and Julia to-night|"	210:277,15C  !
4C	"perhaps \you\ can tell me why my brother	210:277,27C  !
4C	goes to town to-morrow. He says, he has business there,	210:277,28C  !
4C	but will not tell me what. The first time he ever denied	210:277,29C  !
4C	me his confidence| But this is what we all come to.	210:277,30C  !
4C	All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply	210:277,31C  !
4C	to you for information. Pray what is Henry going for?"	210:277,32C  !
4C	"Well, then,"	210:277,35C  !
4C	"I must	210:277,35C  !

4C	brother and talking of you by the way."	210:277,37C  !
4B	"I am worn out with civility,"	210:278,31B  !
4B	"I have	210:278,31B  !
4B	been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say.	210:278,32B  !
4B	But with \you\, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not	210:278,33B  !

4D	"I shall have only a desolate house	210:280,12D  !
4D	to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of time	210:280,13D  !
4D	and his own very different to-morrow."	210:280,14D  !
4F	"She could not recollect what	211:283, 1F  !
4F	it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes,	211:283, 2F  !
4F	or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny;	211:283, 3F  !
4F	she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking	211:283, 4F  !
4F	of Mr% Crawford or of William, when he said he was	211:283, 5F  !
4F	the finest young man in the room; somebody had whispered	211:283, 6F  !
4F	something to her, she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas	211:283, 7F  !
4F	what it could be."	211:283, 8F  !
4F	"Yes ~ yes ~ very well ~ did you? did he? ~ I did not	211:283,10F  !

4F	"I cannot think	211:283,17F  !
4F	what is the matter with me|"	211:283,18F  !
4F	"I feel quite stupid. It	211:283,19F  !
4F	must be sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you must	211:283,20F  !
4F	do something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch	211:283,21F  !
4F	the cards, ~ I feel so very stupid."	211:283,22F  !
4A	"And \that\ makes thirty-one; ~ four in hand and eight in	211:283,27A  !
4A	crib. ~ You are to deal, ma'am; shall I deal for you?"	211:283,28A  !
4E	"We miss our two young men,"	211:284,16E  !
4E	"And	211:284,22E  !
4E	there is no reason to suppose,"	211:284,23E  !
4E	"but	211:284,23E  !
4E	that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent. As to	211:284,24E  !
4E	Edmund, we must learn to do without him. This will be	211:284,25E  !
4E	the last winter of his belonging to us, as he has done."	211:284,26E  !
4F	"Yes,"	211:284,27F  !
4F	"but I wish he was not going	211:284,27F  !
4F	away. They are all going away I think. I wish they	211:284,28F  !

4F	"Yes" ~	211:285, 5F  !
4F	"Sir Thomas,	211:285, 6F  !
4F	I have been thinking ~ and I am very glad we	211:285, 7F  !
4F	took Fanny as we did, for now the others are away, we feel	211:285, 8F  !
4F	the good of it."	211:285, 9F  !
4E	"Very true. We shew Fanny what a good girl we	211:285,11E  !
4E	think her by praising her to her face ~ she is now a very	211:285,12E  !
4E	valuable companion. If we have been kind to \her\, she is	211:285,13E  !
4E	now quite as necessary to \us\."	211:285,14E  !
4F	"Yes,"	211:285,15F  !
4F	"and it is a comfort	211:285,15F  !

4E	"She will never leave us, I hope, till	211:285,18E  !
4E	invited to some other home that may reasonably promise	211:285,19E  !
4E	her greater happiness than she knows here."	211:285,20E  !
4F	"And \that\ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who	211:285,21F  !
4F	should invite her? Maria might be very glad to see her at	211:285,22F  !
4F	Sotherton now and then, but she would not think of asking	211:285,23F  !
4F	her to live there ~ and I am sure she is better off here ~ and	211:285,24F  !
4F	besides I cannot do without her."	211:285,25F  !
4C	"And	211:287,18C  !
4C	how do \you\ like your cousin Edmund's staying away so	211:287,19C  !
4C	long? ~ being the only young person at home, I consider	211:287,20C  !
4C	\you\ as the greatest sufferer. ~ You must miss him. Does	211:287,21C  !
4C	his staying longer surprize you?"	211:287,22C  !
4A	"I do not know,"	211:287,23A  !
4A	"Yes ~	211:287,23A  !
4A	I had not particularly expected it."	211:287,24A  !
4C	"Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of.	211:287,25C  !
4C	It is the general way; all young men do."	211:287,26C  !
4A	"He did not, the only time he went to see Mr% Owen	211:287,27A  !
4A	before."	211:287,28A  !
4C	"He finds the house more agreeable \now\. ~ He is a very ~	211:287,29C  !
4C	a very pleasing young man himself, and I cannot help	211:287,30C  !
4C	being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go	211:287,31C  !
4C	to London, as will now undoubtedly be the case. ~ I am	211:287,32C  !
4C	looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes there	211:287,33C  !
4C	will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to	211:287,34C  !
4C	have seen him once more, I confess. But you must give my	211:287,35C  !
4C	compliments to him. Yes ~ I think it must be compliments.	211:287,36C  !
4C	Is not there a something wanted, Miss Price, in our	211:287,37C  !
4C	language a something between compliments and ~ and	211:287,38C  !
4C	love ~ to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had	211:288, 1C  !
4C	together? ~ So many months acquaintance| ~ But compliments	211:288, 2C  !
4C	may be sufficient here. ~ Was his letter a long one?	211:288, 3C  !
4C	~ Does he give you much account of what he is doing? ~	211:288, 4C  !
4C	Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?"	211:288, 5C  !
4A	"I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle ~	211:288, 6A  !
4A	but I believe it was very short; indeed I am sure it was	211:288, 7A  !
4A	but a few lines. All that I heard was that his friend had	211:288, 8A  !
4A	pressed him to stay longer, and that he had agreed to do so.	211:288, 9A  !
4A	A \few\ days longer, or \some\ days longer, I am not quite	211:288,10A  !
4A	sure which."	211:288,11A  !
4C	"Oh| if he wrote to his father ~ but I thought it might	211:288,12C  !
4C	have been to Lady Bertram or you. But if he wrote to his	211:288,13C  !
4C	father, no wonder he was concise. Who could write chat to	211:288,14C  !
4C	Sir Thomas? If he had written to you, there would have	211:288,15C  !
4C	been more particulars. You would have heard of balls and	211:288,16C  !
4C	parties. ~ He would have sent you a description of every thing	211:288,17C  !
4C	and every body. How many Miss Owens are there?"	211:288,18C  !
4A	"Three grown up."	211:288,19A  !

4C	ladies ~ about any three sisters just grown up; for one	211:288,26C  !
4C	knows, without being told, exactly what they are ~ all very	211:288,27C  !
4C	accomplished and pleasing, and \one\ very pretty. There is	211:288,28C  !
4C	a beauty in every family. ~ It is a regular thing. Two play	211:288,29C  !
4C	on the piano-forte, and one on the harp ~ and all sing ~ or	211:288,30C  !

4C	~ all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and	211:289, 1C  !

4C	missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away;	211:289, 9C  !
4C	that is, there is a great difference felt. But I am not	211:289,10C  !
4C	fishing; don't compliment me. If I \am\ missed, it will	211:289,11C  !
4C	appear. I may be discovered by those who want to see	211:289,12C  !
4C	me. I shall not be in any doubtful, or distant, or unapproachable	211:289,13C  !

4C	you were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at	211:289,21C  !
4C	Thornton Lacey; how should you like it? Stranger things	211:289,22C  !
4C	have happened. I dare say they are trying for it. And	211:289,23C  !
4C	they are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty	211:289,24C  !
4C	establishment for them. I do not at all wonder or blame	211:289,25C  !
4C	them. ~ It is every body's duty to do as well for themselves	211:289,26C  !
4C	as they can. Sir Thomas Bertram's son is somebody; and	211:289,27C  !
4C	now, he is in their own line. Their father is a clergyman	211:289,28C  !
4C	and their brother is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen	211:289,29C  !
4C	together. He is their lawful property, he fairly	211:289,30C  !

4C	you don't speak. ~ But honestly now, do not you rather	211:289,32C  !

4D	I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is entirely made	212:291,27D  !
4D	up. Will it astonish you? No ~ You must be aware that	212:291,28D  !
4D	I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price."	212:291,29D  !
4D	"Yes, Mary,"	212:292, 8D  !
4D	"I am fairly caught. You know with what idle designs	212:292, 9D  !
4D	I began ~ but this is the end of them. I have (I flatter	212:292,10D  !
4D	myself) made no inconsiderable progress in her affections;	212:292,11D  !
4D	but my own are entirely fixed."	212:292,12D  !
4C	"Lucky, lucky girl|"	212:292,13C  !
4C	"what a match for her| My dearest Henry, this	212:292,14C  !
4C	must be my \first\ feeling; but my \second\, which you shall	212:292,15C  !
4C	have as sincerely, is that I approve your choice from my	212:292,16C  !
4C	soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and	212:292,17C  !
4C	desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude	212:292,18C  !
4C	and devotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an	212:292,19C  !
4C	amazing match for her| Mrs% Norris often talks of her	212:292,20C  !
4C	luck; what will she say now? The delight of all the	212:292,21C  !
4C	family indeed| And she has some \true\ friends in it. How	212:292,22C  !
4C	\they\ will rejoice| But tell me all about it. Talk to me	212:292,23C  !
4C	for ever. When did you begin to think seriously about	212:292,24C  !
4C	her?"	212:292,25C  !
4C	"Ah| my dear	212:292,31C  !
4C	Henry, and this is what took you to London| This was	212:292,32C  !
4C	your business| You chose to consult the Admiral, before	212:292,33C  !
4C	you made up your mind."	212:292,34C  !
4D	"When Fanny is known to him,"	212:293, 1D  !
4D	"he	212:293, 1D  !
4D	will doat on her. She is exactly the woman to do away	212:293, 2D  !
4D	every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral, for she is	212:293, 3D  !
4D	exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the	212:293, 4D  !
4D	world. She is the very impossibility he would describe ~ if	212:293, 5D  !
4D	indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody	212:293, 6D  !
4D	his own ideas. But till it is absolutely settled ~ settled	212:293, 7D  !
4D	beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the	212:293, 8D  !
4D	matter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You have	212:293, 9D  !
4D	not discovered my business yet|"	212:293,10D  !
4C	"Well, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it	212:293,11C  !
4C	must relate, and am in no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price	212:293,12C  !
4C	~ Wonderful ~ quite wonderful| ~ That Mansfield should	212:293,13C  !
4C	have done so much for ~ that \you\ should have found your	212:293,14C  !
4C	fate in Mansfield| But you are quite right, you could not	212:293,15C  !
4C	have chosen better. There is not a better girl in the world,	212:293,16C  !
4C	and you do not want for fortune; and as to her connections,	212:293,17C  !
4C	they are more than good. The Bertrams are undoubtedly	212:293,18C  !
4C	some of the first people in this country. She is niece	212:293,19C  !
4C	to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world.	212:293,20C  !
4C	But go on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans?	212:293,21C  !
4C	Does she know her own happiness?"	212:293,22C  !
4D	"No."	212:293,23D  !
4C	"What are you waiting for?"	212:293,24C  !
4D	"For ~ for very little more than opportunity. Mary,	212:293,25D  !
4D	she is not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in	212:293,26D  !
4D	vain."	212:293,27D  !
4C	"Oh| no, you cannot. Were you even less pleasing ~	212:293,28C  !
4C	supposing her not to love you already (of which however	212:293,29C  !
4C	I can have little doubt,) you would be safe. The gentleness	212:293,30C  !
4C	and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your	212:293,31C  !
4C	own immediately. From my soul I do not think she would	212:293,32C  !
4C	marry you \without\ love; that is, if there is a girl in the	212:293,33C  !
4C	world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can	212:293,34C  !
4C	suppose it her; but ask her to love you, and she will never	212:293,35C  !
4C	have the heart to refuse."	212:293,36C  !
4D	"I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her,"	212:294,31D  !

4C	"The more I think of it,"	212:294,36C  !
4C	"the more am	212:294,36C  !
4C	I convinced that you are doing quite right, and though	212:294,37C  !
4C	I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most	212:294,38C  !
4C	likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is the very	212:295, 1C  !
4C	one to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her	212:295, 2C  !
4C	peace turns out a clever thought indeed. You will both	212:295, 3C  !
4C	find your good in it."	212:295, 4C  !
4D	"It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature|	212:295, 5D  !
4D	but I did not know her then. And she shall have no reason	212:295, 6D  !
4D	to lament the hour that first put it into my head. I will	212:295, 7D  !
4D	make her very happy, Mary, happier than she has ever yet	212:295, 8D  !
4D	been herself, or ever seen any body else. I will not take her	212:295, 9D  !
4D	from Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent	212:295,10D  !
4D	a place in this neighbourhood ~ perhaps Stanwix Lodge.	212:295,11D  !
4D	I shall let a seven year's lease of Everingham. I am sure of	212:295,12D  !
4D	an excellent tenant at half a word. I could name three	212:295,13D  !
4D	people now, who would give me my own terms and thank	212:295,14D  !
4D	me."	212:295,15D  !

4C	"settle in Northamptonshire|	212:295,16C  !
4C	That is pleasant| Then we shall be all together."	212:295,17C  !
4D	"You must give us more than half your time,"	212:295,23D  !
4D	"I cannot admit Mrs% Grant to have an equal claim with	212:295,24D  !
4D	Fanny and myself, for we shall both have a right in you.	212:295,25D  !
4D	Fanny will be so truly your sister|"	212:295,26D  !

4C	Northamptonshire?"	212:295,31C  !
4D	"Yes."	212:295,32D  !
4C	"That's right; and in London, of course, a house of	212:295,33C  !
4C	your own; no longer with the Admiral. My dearest	212:295,34C  !
4C	Henry, the advantage to you of getting away from the	212:295,35C  !
4C	Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion	212:295,36C  !
4C	of his, before you have contracted any of his foolish	212:295,37C  !
4C	opinions, or learnt to sit over your dinner, as if it were	212:295,38C  !
4C	the best blessing of life| ~ \You\ are not sensible of the	212:296, 1C  !
4C	gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in	212:296, 2C  !
4C	my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of	212:296, 3C  !
4C	you. To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word	212:296, 4C  !
4C	or deed, look or gesture, would have broken my heart."	212:296, 5C  !
4D	"Well, well, we do not think quite alike here. The	212:296, 6D  !
4D	Admiral has his faults, but he is a very good man, and	212:296, 7D  !
4D	has been more than a father to me. Few fathers would	212:296, 8D  !
4D	have let me have my own way half so much. You must	212:296, 9D  !
4D	not prejudice Fanny against him. I must have them	212:296,10D  !
4D	love one another."	212:296,11D  !
4C	"Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price,	212:296,16C  !
4C	that if I could suppose the next Mrs% Crawford would have	212:296,17C  !
4C	half the reason which my poor ill used aunt had to abhor	212:296,18C  !
4C	the very name, I would prevent the marriage, if possible;	212:296,19C  !
4C	but I know you, I know that a wife you \loved\ would be	212:296,20C  !
4C	the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased	212:296,21C  !
4C	to love, she would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding	212:296,22C  !
4C	of a gentleman."	212:296,23C  !
4D	"Had you seen her this morning, Mary,"	212:296,28D  !
4D	"attending with such ineffable sweetness and	212:296,29D  !
4D	patience, to all the demands of her aunt's stupidity,	212:296,30D  !
4D	working with her, and for her, her colour beautifully	212:296,31D  !
4D	heightened as she leant over the work, then returning	212:296,32D  !
4D	to her seat to finish a note which she was previously	212:296,33D  !
4D	engaged in writing for that stupid woman's service, and	212:296,34D  !
4D	all this with such unpretending gentleness, so much as if	212:296,35D  !
4D	it were a matter of course that she was not to have	212:296,36D  !
4D	a moment at her own command, her hair arranged as	212:296,37D  !
4D	neatly as it always is, and one little curl falling forward	212:296,38D  !
4D	as she wrote, which she now and then shook back, and in	212:297, 1D  !
4D	the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to \me\, or	212:297, 2D  !
4D	listening, and as if she liked to listen to what I said.	212:297, 3D  !
4D	Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied	212:297, 4D  !
4D	the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing."	212:297, 5D  !
4C	"My dearest Henry,"	212:297, 6C  !
4C	"how glad I am to see you so much	212:297, 7C  !
4C	in love| It quite delights me. But what will Mrs% Rushworth	212:297, 8C  !
4C	and Julia say?"	212:297, 9C  !
4D	"I care neither what they say, nor what they feel.	212:297,10D  !
4D	They will now see what sort of woman it is that can	212:297,11D  !
4D	attach me, that can attach a man of sense. I wish the	212:297,12D  !
4D	discovery may do them any good. And they will now	212:297,13D  !
4D	see their cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish	212:297,14D  !
4D	they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable	212:297,15D  !
4D	neglect and unkindness. They will be angry,"	212:297,16D  !
4D	"Mrs% Rushworth	212:297,17D  !
4D	will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill	212:297,18D  !
4D	to her; that is, like other bitter pills, it will have two	212:297,19D  !
4D	moments ill-flavour, and then be swallowed and forgotten;	212:297,20D  !
4D	for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her	212:297,21D  !
4D	feelings more lasting than other women's, though \I\ was	212:297,22D  !
4D	the object of them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel	212:297,23D  !
4D	a difference indeed, a daily, hourly difference, in the	212:297,24D  !
4D	behaviour of every being who approaches her; and it	212:297,25D  !
4D	will be the completion of my happiness to know that	212:297,26D  !
4D	I am the doer of it, that I am the person to give the	212:297,27D  !
4D	consequence so justly her due. Now she is dependent,	212:297,28D  !
4D	helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten."	212:297,29D  !
4C	"Nay, Henry, not by all, not forgotten by all, not	212:297,30C  !
4C	friendless or forgotten. Her cousin Edmund never	212:297,31C  !
4C	forgets her."	212:297,32C  !
4D	"Edmund ~ True, I believe he is (generally speaking)	212:297,33D  !
4D	kind to her; and so is Sir Thomas in his way, but it is	212:297,34D  !
4D	the way of a rich, superior, longworded, arbitrary uncle.	212:297,35D  !
4D	What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do, what \do\	212:297,36D  !
4D	they do for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity	212:297,37D  !
4D	in the world to what I \shall\ do?"	212:297,38D  !

4D	"I must acknowledge myself	213:298,13D  !
4D	infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an	213:298,14D  !
4D	opportunity of seeing you alone: I have been wishing	213:298,15D  !
4D	it more than you can have any idea. Knowing as I do	213:298,16D  !
4D	what your feelings as a sister are, I could hardly have	213:298,17D  !
4D	borne that any one in the house should share with you	213:298,18D  !
4D	in the first knowledge of the news I now bring. He is	213:298,19D  !
4D	made. Your brother is a Lieutenant. I have the	213:298,20D  !
4D	infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your	213:298,21D  !
4D	brother's promotion. Here are the letters which announce	213:298,22D  !
4D	it, this moment come to hand. You will, perhaps,	213:298,23D  !
4D	like to see them."	213:298,24D  !

4D	as it is, for I think only of yours. Compared with you,	213:299,16D  !
4D	who has a right to be happy? I have almost grudged	213:299,17D  !
4D	myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to	213:299,18D  !
4D	have known before all the world. I have not lost a	213:299,19D  !
4D	moment, however. The post was late this morning, but	213:299,20D  !
4D	there has not been since, a moment's delay. How	213:299,21D  !
4D	impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the	213:299,22D  !
4D	subject, I will not attempt to describe; how severely	213:299,23D  !
4D	mortified, how cruelly disappointed, in not having it	213:299,24D  !
4D	finished while I was in London| I was kept there from	213:299,25D  !
4D	day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear to me	213:299,26D  !
4D	than such an object would have detained me half the	213:299,27D  !
4D	time from Mansfield. But though my uncle entered	213:299,28D  !
4D	into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire, and	213:299,29D  !
4D	exerted himself immediately, there were difficulties from	213:299,30D  !
4D	the absence of one friend, and the engagements of another,	213:299,31D  !
4D	which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of,	213:299,32D  !
4D	and knowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came	213:299,33D  !
4D	away on Monday, trusting that many posts would not	213:299,34D  !
4D	pass before I should be followed by such very letters as	213:299,35D  !

4E	I know you \cannot\ have a fire. Here is some	301:312,27E  !
4E	great misapprehension which must be rectified. It is	301:312,28E  !
4E	highly unfit for you to sit ~ be it only half an hour a day,	301:312,29E  !

4E	Your aunt cannot be aware of this."	301:312,31E  !

4E	"I understand. Your	301:312,37E  !
4E	aunt Norris has always been an advocate, and very judiciously,	301:312,38E  !
4E	for young people's being brought up without	301:313, 1E  !
4E	unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation	301:313, 2E  !
4E	in every thing. ~ She is also very hardy herself, which	301:313, 3E  !
4E	of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants	301:313, 4E  !
4E	of others. And on another account too, I can perfectly	301:313, 5E  !
4E	comprehend. ~ I know what her sentiments have always	301:313, 6E  !
4E	been. The principle was good in itself, but it may have	301:313, 7E  !
4E	been, and I believe \has\ \been\ carried too far in your case.	301:313, 8E  !
4E	~ I am aware that there has been sometimes, in some	301:313, 9E  !
4E	points, a misplaced distinction; but I think too well of	301:313,10E  !
4E	you, Fanny, to suppose you will ever harbour resentment	301:313,11E  !
4E	on that account. ~ You have an understanding, which will	301:313,12E  !
4E	prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging	301:313,13E  !
4E	partially by the event. ~ You will take in the whole	301:313,14E  !
4E	of the past, you will consider times, persons, and probabilities,	301:313,15E  !
4E	and you will feel that \they\ were not least your	301:313,16E  !
4E	friends who were educating and preparing you for that	301:313,17E  !
4E	mediocrity of condition which \seemed\ to be your lot. ~	301:313,18E  !
4E	Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary,	301:313,19E  !
4E	it was kindly meant; and of this you may be assured,	301:313,20E  !
4E	that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the	301:313,21E  !
4E	little privations and restrictions that may have been	301:313,22E  !
4E	imposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion	301:313,23E  !
4E	of you, by failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris	301:313,24E  !
4E	with the respect and attention that are due to her.	301:313,25E  !
4E	~ But enough of this. Sit down, my dear. I must	301:313,26E  !

4E	you long."	301:313,28E  !
4E	"You are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor	301:313,32E  !
4E	this morning. ~ I had not been long in my own room, after	301:313,33E  !
4E	breakfast, when Mr% Crawford was shewn in. ~ His errand	301:313,34E  !
4E	you may probably conjecture."	301:313,35E  !

4E	one still better worth listening to. ~ Mr% Crawford, as you	301:314,27E  !

4A	no, Sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down to him.	301:314,33A  !
4A	Mr% Crawford	301:314,33A  !
4A	ought to know ~ he must know that ~ I told	301:314,34A  !
4A	him enough yesterday to convince him ~ he spoke to me	301:314,35A  !
4A	on this subject yesterday ~ and I told him without disguise	301:314,36A  !

4A	of my power to return his good opinion."	301:314,38A  !

4E	"Out of your power to return his good	301:315, 2E  !
4E	opinion| what is all this? I know he spoke to you yesterday,	301:315, 3E  !
4E	and (as far as I understand), received as much	301:315, 4E  !
4E	encouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman	301:315, 5E  !
4E	could permit herself to give. I was very much pleased	301:315, 6E  !
4E	with what I collected to have been your behaviour on	301:315, 7E  !
4E	the occasion; it shewed a discretion highly to be commended.	301:315, 8E  !
4E	But now, when he has made his overtures so	301:315, 9E  !
4E	properly, and honourably ~ what are your scruples \now\?"	301:315,10E  !
4A	"You are mistaken, Sir," ~	301:315,11A  !
4A	"You are quite mistaken. How could Mr% Crawford	301:315,13A  !
4A	say such a thing? I gave him no encouragement	301:315,14A  !
4A	yesterday ~ On the contrary, I told him ~ I cannot recollect	301:315,15A  !
4A	my exact words ~ but I am sure I told him that I	301:315,16A  !
4A	would not listen to him, that it was very unpleasant to	301:315,17A  !
4A	me in every respect, and that I begged him never to talk	301:315,18A  !
4A	to me in that manner again. ~ I am sure I said as much	301:315,19A  !
4A	as that and more; and I should have said still more, ~	301:315,20A  !
4A	if I had been quite certain of his meaning any thing	301:315,21A  !
4A	seriously, but I did not like to be ~ I could not bear to be	301:315,22A  !
4A	~ imputing more than might be intended. I thought it	301:315,23A  !
4A	might all pass for nothing with \him\."	301:315,24A  !
4E	"Am I to understand,"	301:315,26E  !

4A	"I ~ I cannot like him, Sir, well enough to marry him."	301:315,34A  !
4E	"This is very strange|"	301:315,35E  !
4E	"There is something in this which	301:315,36E  !
4E	my comprehension does not reach. Here is a young man	301:315,37E  !
4E	wishing to pay his addresses to you, with every thing to	301:315,38E  !
4E	recommend him; not merely situation in life, fortune,	301:316, 1E  !
4E	and character, but with more than common agreeableness,	301:316, 2E  !
4E	with address and conversation pleasing to every body.	301:316, 3E  !
4E	And he is not an acquaintance of to-day, you have	301:316, 4E  !
4E	now known him some time. His sister, moreover, is your	301:316, 5E  !
4E	intimate friend, and he has been doing \that\ for your	301:316, 6E  !
4E	brother, which I should suppose would have been almost	301:316, 7E  !
4E	sufficient recommendation to you, had there been no	301:316, 8E  !
4E	other. It is very uncertain when my interest might have	301:316, 9E  !

4E	"his wishing to marry at	301:317, 7E  !
4E	all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an advocate	301:317, 8E  !
4E	for early marriages, where there are means in proportion,	301:317, 9E  !

4E	We had better put an end to this most mortifying conference.	301:318,11E  !
4E	Mr% Crawford must not be kept longer waiting. I will,	301:318,12E  !
4E	therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my	301:318,13E  !
4E	opinion of your conduct ~ that you have disappointed	301:318,14E  !
4E	every expectation I had formed, and proved yourself of	301:318,15E  !
4E	a character the very reverse of what I had supposed.	301:318,16E  !
4E	For I \had\, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have	301:318,17E  !
4E	shewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the	301:318,18E  !
4E	period of my return to England. I had thought you	301:318,19E  !
4E	peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper, self-conceit, and	301:318,20E  !
4E	every tendency to that independence of spirit, which prevails	301:318,21E  !
4E	so much in modern days, even in young women, and	301:318,22E  !
4E	which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond	301:318,23E  !
4E	all common offence. But you have now shewn me that	301:318,24E  !
4E	you can be wilful and perverse, that you can and will	301:318,25E  !
4E	decide for yourself, without any consideration or deference	301:318,26E  !
4E	for those who have surely some right to guide you ~ without	301:318,27E  !
4E	even asking their advice. You have shewn yourself	301:318,28E  !
4E	very, very different from any thing that I had imagined.	301:318,29E  !
4E	The advantage or disadvantage of your family ~ of your	301:318,30E  !
4E	parents ~ your brothers and sisters ~ never seems to have	301:318,31E  !
4E	had a moment's share in your thoughts on this occasion.	301:318,32E  !
4E	How \they\ might be benefited, how \they\ must rejoice in	301:318,33E  !
4E	such an establishment for you ~ is nothing to \you\. You	301:318,34E  !
4E	think only of yourself; and because you do not feel for	301:318,35E  !
4E	Mr% Crawford exactly what a young, heated fancy imagines	301:318,36E  !
4E	to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him	301:318,37E  !
4E	at once, without wishing even for a little time to consider	301:318,38E  !
4E	of it ~ a little more time for cool consideration, and for	301:319, 1E  !
4E	really examining your own inclinations ~ and are, in a	301:319, 2E  !
4E	wild fit of folly, throwing away from you such an opportunity	301:319, 3E  !
4E	of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably, nobly	301:319, 4E  !
4E	settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again.	301:319, 5E  !
4E	Here is a young man of sense, of character, of temper, of	301:319, 6E  !
4E	manners, and of fortune, exceedingly attached to you,	301:319, 7E  !
4E	and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested	301:319, 8E  !
4E	way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you may	301:319, 9E  !
4E	live eighteen years longer in the world, without being	301:319,10E  !
4E	addressed by a man of half Mr% Crawford's estate, or	301:319,11E  !
4E	a tenth part of his merits. Gladly would I have bestowed	301:319,12E  !
4E	either of my own daughters on him. Maria is nobly	301:319,13E  !
4E	married ~ but had Mr% Crawford sought Julia's hand, I	301:319,14E  !
4E	should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt	301:319,15E  !
4E	satisfaction than I gave Maria's to Mr% Rushworth."	301:319,16E  !
4E	"And I should have been	301:319,17E  !
4E	very much surprised had either of my daughters, on	301:319,18E  !
4E	receiving a proposal of marriage at any time, which might	301:319,19E  !
4E	carry with it only \half\ the eligibility of \this\, immediately	301:319,20E  !
4E	and peremptorily, and without paying my opinion or my	301:319,21E  !
4E	regard the compliment of any consultation, put a decided	301:319,22E  !
4E	negative on it. I should have been much surprised, and	301:319,23E  !
4E	much hurt, by such a proceeding. I should have thought	301:319,24E  !
4E	it a gross violation of duty and respect. \You\ are not to be	301:319,25E  !
4E	judged by the same rule. You do not owe me the duty	301:319,26E  !
4E	of a child. But, Fanny, if your heart can acquit you of	301:319,27E  !
4E	\ingratitude\ ~"	301:319,28E  !
4A	"I am very sorry,"	301:319,37A  !
4A	"I am very sorry indeed."	301:319,38A  !
4E	"Sorry| yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will	301:320, 1E  !
4E	probably have reason to be long sorry for this day's	301:320, 2E  !
4E	transactions."	301:320, 3E  !
4A	"If it were possible for me to do otherwise,"	301:320, 4A  !
4A	"but I am so perfectly convinced	301:320, 5A  !
4A	that I could never make him happy, and that I	301:320, 6A  !
4A	should be miserable myself."	301:320, 7A  !
4E	"Well,"	301:320,21E  !
4E	"well, child, dry up your tears. There is no use in these	301:320,23E  !
4E	tears; they can do no good. You must now come down stairs	301:320,24E  !
4E	with me. Mr% Crawford has been kept waiting too	301:320,25E  !
4E	long already. You must give him your own answer; we	301:320,26E  !
4E	cannot expect him to be satisfied with less; and you only	301:320,27E  !
4E	can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of	301:320,28E  !
4E	your sentiments, which, unfortunately for himself, he	301:320,29E  !
4E	certainly has imbibed. I am totally unequal to it."	301:320,30E  !
4E	"Mr% Crawford	301:321,21E  !
4E	is gone; he has just left me. I need not repeat	301:321,22E  !
4E	what has passed. I do not want to add to any thing you	301:321,23E  !
4E	may now be feeling, by an account of what he has felt.	301:321,24E  !
4E	Suffice it, that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike	301:321,25E  !
4E	and generous manner; and has confirmed me in a	301:321,26E  !
4E	most favourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and	301:321,27E  !
4E	temper. Upon my representation of what you were suffering,	301:321,28E  !
4E	he immediately, and with the greatest delicacy, ceased	301:321,29E  !
4E	to urge to see you for the present."	301:321,30E  !
4E	"Of course,"	301:321,32E  !
4E	"it cannot be supposed	301:321,32E  !
4E	but that he should request to speak with you alone,	301:321,33E  !
4E	be it only for five minutes; a request too natural, a claim	301:321,34E  !
4E	too just to be denied. But there is no time fixed, perhaps	301:321,35E  !
4E	to-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough.	301:321,36E  !
4E	For the present you have only to tranquillize yourself.	301:321,37E  !
4E	Check these tears; they do but exhaust you. If, as I am	301:321,38E  !
4E	willing to suppose, you wish to shew me any observance,	301:322, 1E  !
4E	you will not give way to these emotions, but endeavour	301:322, 2E  !
4E	to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind. I advise	301:322, 3E  !
4E	you to go out, the air will do you good; go out for an hour	301:322, 4E  !
4E	on the gravel, you will have the shrubbery to yourself,	301:322, 5E  !
4E	and will be the better for air and exercise. And, Fanny,	301:322, 6E  !
4E	I shall make no mention	301:322, 7E  !
4E	below of what has passed; I shall not even tell your	301:322, 8E  !
4E	aunt Bertram. There is no occasion for spreading the	301:322, 9E  !
4E	disappointment; say nothing about it yourself."	301:322,10E  !
4A	"I must be a brute indeed, if I can be really ungrateful|"	301:322,38A  !
4A	"Heaven defend me from being	301:323, 1A  !
4A	ungrateful|"	301:323, 2A  !
4J	"If I had known you were going out, I should have	301:323,14J  !
4J	got you just to go as far as my house with some orders	301:323,15J  !
4J	for Nanny,"	301:323,16J  !
4J	"which I have since, to my very	301:323,16J  !
4J	great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry myself.	301:323,17J  !
4J	I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved	301:323,18J  !
4J	me the trouble, if you would only have been so good as to	301:323,19J  !
4J	let us know you were going out. It would have made no	301:323,20J  !
4J	difference to you, I suppose, whether you had walked in	301:323,21J  !
4J	the shrubbery, or gone to my house."	301:323,22J  !
4E	"I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the dryest	301:323,23E  !
4E	place,"	301:323,24E  !
4J	"Oh|"	301:323,25J  !
4J	"that	301:323,25J  !
4J	was very kind of you, Sir Thomas; but you do not know	301:323,26J  !
4J	how dry the path is to my house. Fanny would have	301:323,27J  !
4J	had quite as good a walk there, I assure you; with the	301:323,28J  !
4J	advantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt:	301:323,29J  !
4J	it is all her fault. If she would but have let us know she	301:323,30J  !
4J	was going out ~ but there is a something about Fanny,	301:323,31J  !
4J	I have often observed it before, ~ she likes to go her own	301:323,32J  !
4J	way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she	301:323,33J  !
4J	takes her own independent walk whenever she can; she	301:323,34J  !
4J	certainly has a little spirit of secrecy, and independence,	301:323,35J  !
4J	and nonsense, about her, which I would advise her to get	301:323,36J  !
4J	the better of."	301:323,37J  !
4J	"Stay,	301:325, 5J  !
4J	stay, Fanny| what are you about? ~ where are you going?	301:325, 6J  !
4J	~ don't be in such a hurry. Depend upon it, it is not you	301:325, 7J  !
4J	that are wanted; depend upon it it is me;	301:325, 8J  !
4J	but you are so very eager to put yourself forward.	301:325, 9J  !
4J	What should Sir Thomas want you for? It is me, Baddeley,	301:325,10J  !
4J	you mean; I am coming this moment. You mean	301:325,11J  !
4J	me, Baddeley, I am sure; Sir Thomas wants me, not	301:325,12J  !
4J	Miss Price."	301:325,12J  !
4E	"Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr% Crawford	302:330,13E  !
4E	again, and learn from him exactly how matters stand	302:330,14E  !
4E	between you. He is a most extraordinary young man,	302:330,15E  !
4E	and whatever be the event, you must feel that you have	302:330,16E  !
4E	created an attachment of no common character; though,	302:330,17E  !
4E	young as you are, and little acquainted with the transient,	302:330,18E  !
4E	varying, unsteady nature of love, as it generally exists,	302:330,19E  !
4E	you cannot be struck as I am with all that is wonderful	302:330,20E  !
4E	in a perseverance of this sort, against discouragement.	302:330,21E  !
4E	With him, it is entirely a matter of feeling; he claims no	302:330,22E  !
4E	merit in it, perhaps is entitled to none. Yet, having	302:330,23E  !
4E	chosen so well, his constancy has a respectable stamp.	302:330,24E  !
4E	Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should have	302:330,25E  !
4E	condemned his persevering."	302:330,26E  !
4A	"Indeed, Sir,"	302:330,27A  !
4A	"I am very sorry that Mr% Crawford	302:330,27A  !
4A	should continue to ~~ I know that it is paying	302:330,28A  !
4A	me a very great compliment, and I feel most undeservedly	302:330,29A  !
4A	honoured, but I am so perfectly convinced, and I have	302:330,30A  !
4A	told him so, that it never will be in my power ~"	302:330,31A  !
4E	"My dear,"	302:330,32E  !
4E	"there is no occasion	302:330,32E  !
4E	for this. Your feelings are as well known to me, as	302:330,33E  !
4E	my wishes and regrets must be to you. There is nothing	302:330,34E  !
4E	more to be said or done. From this hour, the subject is	302:330,35E  !
4E	never to be revived between us. You will have nothing	302:330,36E  !
4E	to fear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose me	302:330,37E  !
4E	capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your	302:330,38E  !
4E	inclinations. Your happiness and advantage are all that	302:331, 1E  !
4E	I have in view, and nothing is required of you but to bear	302:331, 2E  !
4E	with Mr% Crawford's endeavours to convince you, that they	302:331, 3E  !
4E	may not be incompatible with his. He proceeds at his	302:331, 4E  !
4E	own risk. You are on safe ground. I have engaged for	302:331, 5E  !
4E	your seeing him whenever he calls, as you might have	302:331, 6E  !
4E	done, had nothing of his sort occurred. You will see him	302:331, 7E  !
4E	with the rest of us, in the same manner, and as much as	302:331, 8E  !
4E	you can, dismissing the recollection of every thing unpleasant.	302:331, 9E  !
4E	He leaves Northamptonshire so soon, that even	302:331,10E  !
4E	this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded. The	302:331,11E  !
4E	future must be very uncertain. And now, my dear	302:331,12E  !
4E	Fanny, this subject is closed between us."	302:331,13E  !
4F	"Well, Fanny,"	302:332,37F  !
4F	"Well, Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this	302:333, 3F  !
4F	morning. I must just speak of it \once\, I told Sir Thomas	302:333, 4F  !
4F	I must \once\, and then I shall have done. I give you joy,	302:333, 5F  !
4F	my dear niece." ~	302:333, 6F  !
4F	"Humph ~ We certainly are a handsome family."	302:333, 7F  !
4A	"My dear aunt, \you\ cannot wish me to do differently	302:333,11A  !
4A	from what I have done, I am sure. \You\ cannot wish me	302:333,12A  !
4A	to marry; for you would miss me, should not you? ~	302:333,13A  !
4A	Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that."	302:333,14A  !
4F	"No, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when	302:333,15F  !
4F	such an offer as this comes in your way. I could do very	302:333,16F  !
4F	well without you, if you were married to a man of such	302:333,17F  !
4F	good estate as Mr% Crawford. And you must be aware,	302:333,18F  !
4F	Fanny, that it is every young woman's duty to accept such	302:333,19F  !
4F	a very unexceptionable offer as this."	302:333,20F  !
4F	"I will tell you what, Fanny,"	302:333,28F  !
4F	"I am sure he	302:333,28F  !
4F	fell in love with you at the ball, I am sure the mischief was	302:333,29F  !
4F	done that evening. You did look remarkably well. Every body	302:333,30F  !
4F	said so. Sir Thomas said so. And you know you had	302:333,31F  !
4F	Chapman to help you dress. I am very glad I sent	302:333,32F  !
4F	Chapman to you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it	302:333,33F  !
4F	was done that evening." ~	302:333,34F  !
4F	"And	302:333,35F  !
4F	I will tell you what, Fanny ~ which is more than I did for	302:333,36F  !
4F	Maria ~ the next time pug has a litter you shall have	302:333,37F  !
4F	a puppy."	302:333,38F  !

4D	Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing	303:338, 8D  !

4B	books we open, and we all talk Shakespeare, use his	303:338,18B  !
4B	similies, and describe with his descriptions; but this is	303:338,19B  !
4B	totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it. To	303:338,20B  !
4B	know him in bits and scraps, is common enough; to know	303:338,21B  !
4B	him pretty thoroughly, is, perhaps, not uncommon; but to	303:338,22B  !

4B	among those who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years	303:339,35B  !
4B	ago, the larger number, to judge by their performance,	303:339,36B  !
4B	must have thought reading was reading, and preaching was	303:339,37B  !
4B	preaching. It is different now. The subject is more justly	303:339,38B  !
4B	considered. It is felt that distinctness and energy may	303:340, 1B  !
4B	have weight in recommending the most solid truths; and,	303:340, 2B  !
4B	besides, there is more general observation and taste,	303:340, 3B  !
4B	a more critical knowledge diffused, than formerly; in	303:340, 4B  !
4B	every congregation, there is a larger proportion who know	303:340, 5B  !
4B	a little of the matter, and who can judge and criticize."	303:340, 6B  !
4D	"Our liturgy,"	303:340,25D  !
4D	"has beauties,	303:340,25D  !
4D	which not even a careless, slovenly style of reading can	303:340,26D  !
4D	destroy; but it has also redundancies and repetitions,	303:340,27D  !
4D	which require good reading not to be felt. For myself, at	303:340,28D  !
4D	least, I must confess being not always so attentive as	303:340,29D  !
4D	I ought to be ~	303:340,30D  !
4D	that nineteen	303:340,30D  !
4D	times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer	303:340,31D  !
4D	ought to be read, and longing to have it to read myself ~	303:340,32D  !
4D	Did you speak?"	303:340,33D  !
4A	"No,"	303:340,34A  !
4D	"Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your	303:340,35D  !
4D	lips move. I fancied you might be going to tell me	303:340,36D  !
4D	I \ought\ to be more attentive, and not \allow\ my thoughts to	303:340,37D  !
4D	wander. Are not you going to tell me so?"	303:340,38D  !
4A	"No, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to ~	303:341, 1A  !
4A	even supposing ~"	303:341, 2A  !
4D	"A sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than	303:341, 8D  !
4D	prayers well read. A sermon, good in itself, is no rare	303:341, 9D  !
4D	thing. It is more difficult to speak well than to compose	303:341,10D  !
4D	well; that is, the rules and trick of composition are oftener	303:341,11D  !
4D	an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon, thoroughly	303:341,12D  !
4D	well delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hear	303:341,13D  !
4D	such a one without the greatest admiration and respect,	303:341,14D  !
4D	and more than half a mind to take orders and preach	303:341,15D  !

4D	when it is really eloquence, which is entitled to the highest	303:341,17D  !
4D	praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and	303:341,18D  !
4D	affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects	303:341,19D  !
4D	limited, and long worn thread-bare in all common hands;	303:341,20D  !
4D	who can say any thing new or striking, any thing that	303:341,21D  !
4D	rouses the attention, without offending the taste, or	303:341,22D  !
4D	wearing out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom one	303:341,23D  !
4D	could not (in his public capacity) honour enough. I should	303:341,24D  !
4D	like to be such a man."	303:341,25D  !
4D	"I should indeed. I never listened to a distinguished	303:341,27D  !
4D	preacher in my life, without a sort of envy. But then,	303:341,28D  !
4D	I must have a London audience. I could not preach, but	303:341,29D  !
4D	to the educated; to those who were capable of estimating	303:341,30D  !
4D	my composition. And, I do not know that I should be fond	303:341,31D  !
4D	of preaching often; now and then, perhaps, once or twice	303:341,32D  !
4D	in the spring, after being anxiously expected for half	303:341,33D  !

4D	as far as you can be deserved by any body, I do deserve	303:343,35D  !
4D	you. ~ You are infinitely my superior in merit; all \that\	303:343,36D  !

4D	You have some touches of the angel in you, beyond what ~	303:344, 1D  !
4D	not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees	303:344, 2D  !
4D	any thing like it ~ but beyond what one fancies might be.	303:344, 3D  !
4D	But still I am not frightened. It is not by equality of merit	303:344, 4D  !
4D	that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is he	303:344, 5D  !

4D	you most devotedly, that has the best right to a return.	303:344, 7D  !

4B	"in order to have	304:346, 8B  !
4B	a comfortable walk, something more is necessary than	304:346, 9B  !
4B	merely pacing this gravel together. You must talk to	304:346,10B  !
4B	me. I know you have something on your mind. I know	304:346,11B  !
4B	what you are thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed.	304:346,12B  !
4B	Am I to hear of it from every body but Fanny	304:346,13B  !
4B	herself?"	304:346,14B  !
4A	"If you	304:346,15A  !

4B	but you can tell me them. I do not mean to press	304:346,19B  !
4B	you, however. If it is not what you wish yourself, I have	304:346,20B  !
4B	done. I had thought it might be a relief."	304:346,21B  !

4B	"Do you suppose that we think differently? I have	304:346,24B  !
4B	no idea of it. I dare say, that on a comparison of our	304:346,25B  !
4B	opinions, they would be found as much alike as they have	304:346,26B  !
4B	been used to be: to the point ~ I consider Crawford's	304:346,27B  !
4B	proposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could	304:346,28B  !
4B	return his affection. I consider it as most natural that all	304:346,29B  !
4B	your family should wish you could return it; but that	304:346,30B  !
4B	as you cannot, you have done exactly as you ought in	304:346,31B  !
4B	refusing him. Can there be any disagreement between	304:346,32B  !
4B	us here?"	304:346,33B  !
4A	"Oh no| But I thought you blamed me. I thought	304:346,34A  !
4A	you were against me. This is such a comfort."	304:346,35A  !
4B	"This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had	304:346,36B  !
4B	you sought it. But how could you possibly suppose me	304:346,37B  !
4B	against you? How could you imagine me an advocate	304:346,38B  !
4B	for marriage without love? Were I even careless in	304:347, 1B  !
4B	general on such matters, how could you imagine me so	304:347, 2B  !
4B	where \your\ happiness was at stake?"	304:347, 3B  !
4A	"My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been	304:347, 4A  !
4A	talking to you."	304:347, 5A  !
4B	"As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly	304:347, 6B  !
4B	right. I may be sorry, I may be surprised ~ though	304:347, 7B  !
4B	hardly \that\, for you had not had time to attach yourself;	304:347, 8B  !
4B	but I think you perfectly right. Can it admit of a question?	304:347, 9B  !
4B	It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love	304:347,10B  !
4B	him ~ nothing could have justified your accepting him."	304:347,11B  !
4B	"So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were	304:347,13B  !
4B	quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise. But the	304:347,14B  !
4B	matter does not end here. Crawford's is no common	304:347,15B  !
4B	attachment; he perseveres, with the hope of creating	304:347,16B  !
4B	that regard which had not been created before. This,	304:347,17B  !
4B	we know, must be a work of time. But	304:347,18B  !
4B	let him succeed at last, Fanny, let him	304:347,19B  !
4B	succeed at last. You have proved yourself upright and	304:347,20B  !
4B	disinterested, prove yourself grateful and tender-hearted;	304:347,21B  !
4B	and then you will be the perfect model of a woman, which	304:347,22B  !
4B	I have always believed you born for."	304:347,23B  !
4A	"Oh| never, never, never; he never will succeed with	304:347,24A  !
4A	me."	304:347,25A  !
4B	"Never, Fanny, so very determined and positive| This	304:347,28B  !
4B	is not like yourself, your rational self."	304:347,29B  !
4A	"I mean,"	304:347,30A  !
4A	"that I \think\, I never shall, as far as the future can be	304:347,31A  !
4A	answered for ~ I think I never shall return his regard."	304:347,32A  !
4B	"I must hope better things. I am aware, more aware	304:347,33B  !
4B	than Crawford can be, that the man who means to make	304:347,34B  !
4B	you love him (you having due notice of his intentions),	304:347,35B  !
4B	must have very up-hill work, for there are all your early	304:347,36B  !
4B	attachments, and habits, in battle array; and before he	304:347,37B  !
4B	can get your heart for his own use, he has to unfasten it	304:347,38B  !
4B	from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate,	304:348, 1B  !
4B	which so many years growth have confirmed, and which	304:348, 2B  !
4B	are considerably tightened for the moment by the very	304:348, 3B  !
4B	idea of separation. I know that the apprehension of	304:348, 4B  !
4B	being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming	304:348, 5B  !
4B	you against him. I wish he had not been obliged to tell	304:348, 6B  !
4B	you what he was trying for. I wish he had known you	304:348, 7B  !
4B	as well as I do, Fanny. Between us, I think we should	304:348, 8B  !
4B	have won you. My theoretical and his practical knowledge	304:348, 9B  !
4B	together, could not have failed. He should have	304:348,10B  !
4B	worked upon my plans. I must hope, however, that time	304:348,11B  !
4B	proving him (as I firmly believe it will), to deserve you	304:348,12B  !
4B	by his steady affection, will give him his reward. I cannot	304:348,13B  !
4B	suppose that you have not the \wish\ to love him ~ the	304:348,14B  !
4B	natural wish of gratitude. You must have some feeling	304:348,15B  !
4B	of that sort. You must be sorry for your own indifference."	304:348,16B  !
4A	"We are so totally unlike,"	304:348,17A  !
4A	"we are so very, very different in all our	304:348,18A  !
4A	inclinations and ways, that I consider it as quite impossible	304:348,19A  !
4A	we should ever be tolerably happy together, even if	304:348,20A  !
4A	I \could\ like him. There never were two people more dissimilar.	304:348,21A  !
4A	We have not one taste in common. We should	304:348,22A  !
4A	be miserable."	304:348,23A  !
4B	"You are mistaken, Fanny. The dissimilarity is not	304:348,24B  !
4B	so strong. You are quite enough alike. You \have\ tastes	304:348,25B  !
4B	in common. You have moral and literary tastes in common.	304:348,26B  !
4B	You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings;	304:348,27B  !
4B	and Fanny, who that heard him read, and saw you	304:348,28B  !
4B	listen to Shakespeare the other night, will think you	304:348,29B  !
4B	unfitted as companions? You forget yourself: there is	304:348,30B  !
4B	a decided difference in your tempers, I allow. He is lively,	304:348,31B  !
4B	you are serious; but so much the better; his spirits will	304:348,32B  !
4B	support yours. It is your disposition to be easily dejected,	304:348,33B  !
4B	and to fancy difficulties greater than they are. His cheerfulness	304:348,34B  !
4B	will counteract this. He sees difficulties no where;	304:348,35B  !
4B	and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support	304:348,36B  !
4B	to you. Your being so far unlike, Fanny, does not in the	304:348,37B  !
4B	smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness	304:348,38B  !
4B	together: do not imagine it. I am myself convinced	304:349, 1B  !
4B	that it is rather a favourable circumstance. I am	304:349, 2B  !
4B	perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike;	304:349, 3B  !
4B	I mean unlike in the flow of spirits, in the manners, in	304:349, 4B  !
4B	the inclination for much or little company, in the propensity	304:349, 5B  !
4B	to talk or to be silent, to be grave or to be gay.	304:349, 6B  !
4B	Some opposition here is, I am thoroughly convinced,	304:349, 7B  !
4B	friendly to matrimonial happiness. I exclude extremes	304:349, 8B  !
4B	of course; and a very close resemblance in all those points	304:349, 9B  !
4B	would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme. A	304:349,10B  !
4B	counteraction, gentle and continual, is the best safeguard	304:349,11B  !
4B	of manners and conduct."	304:349,12B  !
4A	"It is not merely in \temper\ that I consider	304:349,20A  !
4A	him as totally unsuited to myself; though in \that\	304:349,21A  !
4A	respect, I think the difference between us too great,	304:349,22A  !
4A	infinitely too great; his spirits often oppress me ~ but	304:349,23A  !
4A	there is something in him which I object to still more.	304:349,24A  !
4A	I must say, cousin, that I cannot approve his character.	304:349,25A  !
4A	I have not thought well of him from the time of the play.	304:349,26A  !
4A	I then saw him behaving, as it appeared to me, so very	304:349,27A  !
4A	improperly and unfeelingly, I may speak of it now because	304:349,28A  !
4A	it is all over ~ so improperly by poor Mr% Rushworth, not	304:349,29A  !
4A	seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him, and paying	304:349,30A  !
4A	attentions to my cousin Maria, which ~ in short, at the	304:349,31A  !
4A	time of the play, I received an impression which will never	304:349,32A  !
4A	be got over."	304:349,33A  !
4B	"My dear Fanny,"	304:349,34B  !
4B	"let us not, any of us, be judged by what	304:349,35B  !
4B	we appeared at that period of general folly. The time	304:349,36B  !
4B	of the play, is a time which I hate to recollect. Maria	304:349,37B  !
4B	was wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong	304:349,38B  !
4B	together; but none so wrong as myself. Compared with	304:350, 1B  !
4B	me, all the rest were blameless. I was playing the fool	304:350, 2B  !
4B	with my eyes open."	304:350, 3B  !
4A	"As a by-stander,"	304:350, 4A  !
4A	"perhaps I saw more	304:350, 4A  !
4A	than you did; and I do think that Mr% Rushworth was	304:350, 5A  !
4A	sometimes very jealous."	304:350, 6A  !
4B	"Very possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more	304:350, 7B  !
4B	improper than the whole business. I am shocked whenever	304:350, 8B  !
4B	I think that Maria could be capable of it; but if she	304:350, 9B  !
4B	could undertake the part, we must not be surprised at the	304:350,10B  !
4B	rest."	304:350,11B  !
4A	"Before the play, I am much mistaken, if \Julia\ did	304:350,12A  !
4A	not think he was paying her attentions."	304:350,13A  !
4B	"Julia| ~ I have heard before from some one of his	304:350,14B  !
4B	being in love with Julia, but I could never see anything	304:350,15B  !
4B	of it. And Fanny, though I hope I do justice to my	304:350,16B  !
4B	sisters' good qualities, I think it very possible that they	304:350,17B  !
4B	might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired	304:350,18B  !
4B	by Crawford, and might shew that desire rather more	304:350,19B  !
4B	unguardedly than was perfectly prudent. I can remember	304:350,20B  !
4B	that they were evidently fond of his society; and	304:350,21B  !
4B	with such encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively,	304:350,22B  !
4B	and it may be a little unthinking, might be led on to ~	304:350,23B  !
4B	There could be nothing very striking, because it is clear	304:350,24B  !
4B	that he had no pretensions; his heart was reserved for	304:350,25B  !
4B	you. And I must say, that its being for you, has raised	304:350,26B  !
4B	him inconceivably in my opinion. It does him the highest	304:350,27B  !
4B	honour; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of	304:350,28B  !
4B	domestic happiness, and pure attachment. It proves him	304:350,29B  !
4B	unspoilt by his uncle. It proves him, in short, every thing	304:350,30B  !
4B	that I had been used to wish to believe him, and	304:350,31B  !
4B	feared he was not."	304:350,32B  !
4A	"I am persuaded that he does not think as he ought,	304:350,33A  !
4A	on serious subjects."	304:350,34A  !
4B	"Say rather, that he has not thought at all upon serious	304:350,35B  !
4B	subjects, which I believe to be a good deal the case. How	304:350,36B  !
4B	could it be otherwise, with such an education and adviser?	304:350,37B  !
4B	Under the disadvantages, indeed, which both have had,	304:350,38B  !
4B	is it not wonderful that they should be what they are?	304:351, 1B  !
4B	Crawford's \feelings\, I am ready to acknowledge, have	304:351, 2B  !
4B	hitherto been too much his guides. Happily, those feelings	304:351, 3B  !
4B	have generally been good. You will supply the rest; and	304:351, 4B  !
4B	a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a	304:351, 5B  !
4B	creature ~ to a woman, who firm as a rock in her own principles,	304:351, 6B  !
4B	has a gentleness of character so well adapted to	304:351, 7B  !
4B	recommend them. He has chosen his partner, indeed,	304:351, 8B  !
4B	with rare felicity. He will make you happy, Fanny, I	304:351, 9B  !
4B	know he will make you happy; but you will make him	304:351,10B  !
4B	every thing."	304:351,11B  !
4A	"I would not engage in such a charge,"	304:351,12A  !
4A	"in such an office of high responsibility|"	304:351,13A  !
4B	"As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything| ~	304:351,15B  !
4B	fancying every thing too much for you| Well, though	304:351,16B  !
4B	I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings,	304:351,17B  !
4B	you will be persuaded into them I trust. I confess myself	304:351,18B  !
4B	sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common	304:351,19B  !
4B	interest in Crawford's well doing. Next to your happiness,	304:351,20B  !
4B	Fanny, his has the first claim on me. You are aware	304:351,21B  !
4B	of my having no common interest in Crawford."	304:351,22B  !
4B	"I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking	304:351,27B  !
4B	of it yesterday, particularly pleased, because I had not	304:351,28B  !
4B	depended upon her seeing every thing in so just a light.	304:351,29B  !
4B	I knew she was very fond of you, but yet I was afraid of	304:351,30B  !
4B	her not estimating your worth to her brother, quite as it	304:351,31B  !
4B	deserved, and of her regretting that he had not rather	304:351,32B  !
4B	fixed on some woman of distinction, or fortune. I was	304:351,33B  !
4B	afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims, which she has	304:351,34B  !
4B	been too much used to hear. But it was very different.	304:351,35B  !
4B	She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought. She desires	304:351,36B  !
4B	the connection as warmly as your uncle or myself. We	304:351,37B  !
4B	had a long talk about it. I should not have mentioned	304:351,38B  !
4B	the subject, though very anxious to know her sentiments	304:352, 1B  !
4B	~ but I had not been in the room five minutes, before she	304:352, 2B  !
4B	began, introducing it with all that openness of heart, and	304:352, 3B  !
4B	sweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness,	304:352, 4B  !
4B	which are so much a part of herself. Mrs% Grant	304:352, 5B  !
4B	laughed at her for her rapidity."	304:352, 6B  !
4A	"Was Mrs% Grant in the room, then?"	304:352, 7A  !
4B	"Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters	304:352, 8B  !
4B	together by themselves; and when once we had begun,	304:352, 9B  !
4B	we had not done with you, Fanny, till Crawford and	304:352,10B  !
4B	Dr% Grant came in."	304:352,11B  !
4A	"It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford."	304:352,12A  !
4B	"Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best.	304:352,13B  !
4B	You will see her, however, before she goes. She is very	304:352,14B  !
4B	angry with you, Fanny; you must be prepared for that.	304:352,15B  !
4B	She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her	304:352,16B  !
4B	anger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister,	304:352,17B  !
4B	who thinks her brother has a right to every thing he may	304:352,18B  !
4B	wish for, at the first moment. She is hurt, as you would	304:352,19B  !
4B	be for William; but she loves and esteems you with all	304:352,20B  !
4B	her heart."	304:352,21B  !
4A	"I knew she would be very angry with me."	304:352,22A  !
4B	"My dearest Fanny,"	304:352,23B  !
4B	"do not let the idea of her anger distress	304:352,24B  !
4B	you. It is anger to be talked of, rather than felt. Her	304:352,25B  !
4B	heart is made for love and kindness, not for resentment.	304:352,26B  !
4B	I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise;	304:352,27B  !
4B	I wish you could have seen her countenance, when she	304:352,28B  !
4B	said that you \should\ be Henry's wife. And I observed,	304:352,29B  !
4B	that she always spoke of you as ""Fanny,"" which she was	304:352,30B  !
4B	never used to do; and it had a sound of most sisterly	304:352,31B  !
4B	cordiality."	304:352,32B  !
4A	"And Mrs% Grant, did she say ~ did she speak ~ was	304:352,33A  !
4A	she there all the time?"	304:352,34A  !
4B	"Yes, she was agreeing exactly with her sister. The	304:352,35B  !
4B	surprise of your refusal, Fanny, seems to have been	304:352,36B  !
4B	unbounded. That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford,	304:352,37B  !
4B	seems more than they can understand. I said	304:352,38B  !
4B	what I could for you; but in good truth, as they stated the	304:353, 1B  !
4B	case ~ you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon	304:353, 2B  !
4B	as you can, by a different conduct; nothing else will	304:353, 3B  !
4B	satisfy them. But this is teazing you. I have done. Do	304:353, 4B  !
4B	not turn away from me."	304:353, 5B  !
4A	"I \should\ have thought,"	304:353, 6A  !
4A	"that every woman must have	304:353, 7A  !
4A	felt the possibility of a man's not being approved, not	304:353, 8A  !
4A	being loved by some one of her sex, at least, let him be ever	304:353, 9A  !
4A	so generally agreeable. Let him have all the perfections	304:353,10A  !
4A	in the world, I think it ought not to be set down as certain,	304:353,11A  !
4A	that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may	304:353,12A  !
4A	happen to like himself. But even supposing it is so,	304:353,13A  !
4A	allowing Mr% Crawford to have all the claims which his	304:353,14A  !
4A	sisters think he has, how was I to be prepared to meet him	304:353,15A  !
4A	with any feeling answerable to his own? He took me	304:353,16A  !
4A	wholly by surprise. I had not an idea that his behaviour	304:353,17A  !
4A	to me before had any meaning; and surely I was not to	304:353,18A  !
4A	be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking,	304:353,19A  !
4A	what seemed, very idle notice of me. In my situation, it	304:353,20A  !
4A	would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming	304:353,21A  !
4A	expectations on Mr% Crawford. I am sure his sisters,	304:353,22A  !
4A	rating him as they do, must have thought it so, supposing	304:353,23A  !
4A	he had meant nothing. How then was I to be ~ to be in	304:353,24A  !
4A	love with him the moment he said he was with me? How	304:353,25A  !
4A	was I to have an attachment at his service, as soon as it	304:353,26A  !
4A	was asked for? His sisters should consider me as well	304:353,27A  !
4A	as him. The higher his deserts, the more improper for	304:353,28A  !
4A	me ever to have thought of him. And, and ~ we think	304:353,29A  !
4A	very differently of the nature of women, if they can	304:353,30A  !
4A	imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an	304:353,31A  !
4A	affection as this seems to imply."	304:353,32A  !
4B	"My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth. I know	304:353,33B  !
4B	this to be the truth; and most worthy of you are such	304:353,34B  !
4B	feelings. I had attributed them to you before. I thought	304:353,35B  !
4B	I could understand you. You have now given exactly	304:353,36B  !
4B	the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your	304:353,37B  !
4B	friend and Mrs% Grant, and they were both better satisfied,	304:353,38B  !
4B	though your warm-hearted friend was still run away with	304:354, 1B  !
4B	a little, by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry. I	304:354, 2B  !
4B	told them, that you were of all human creatures the one,	304:354, 3B  !
4B	over whom habit had most power, and novelty least:	304:354, 4B  !
4B	and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford's	304:354, 5B  !
4B	addresses was against him. Their being so new	304:354, 6B  !
4B	and so recent was all in their disfavour; that you could	304:354, 7B  !
4B	tolerate nothing that you were not used to; and a great	304:354, 8B  !
4B	deal more to the same purpose, to give them a knowledge	304:354, 9B  !
4B	of your character. Miss Crawford made us laugh by her	304:354,10B  !
4B	plans of encouragement for her brother. She meant to	304:354,11B  !
4B	urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time,	304:354,12B  !
4B	and of having his addresses most kindly received at the	304:354,13B  !
4B	end of about ten years' happy marriage."	304:354,14B  !
4B	"They go on Monday. You are sure therefore	304:354,28B  !
4B	of seeing your friend either to-morrow or Sunday. They	304:354,29B  !
4B	really go on Monday| and I was within a trifle of being	304:354,30B  !
4B	persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day| I had	304:354,31B  !
4B	almost promised it. What a difference it might have	304:354,32B  !
4B	made. Those five or six days more at Lessingby might	304:354,33B  !
4B	have been felt all my life."	304:354,34B  !
4A	"You were near staying there?"	304:354,35A  !
4B	"Very. I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly	304:354,36B  !
4B	consented. Had I received any letter from Mansfield,	304:354,37B  !
4B	to tell me how you were all going on, I believe I should	304:354,38B  !
4B	certainly have stayed; but I knew nothing that had	304:355, 1B  !
4B	happened here for a fortnight, and felt that I had been	304:355, 2B  !
4B	away long enough."	304:355, 3B  !
4A	"You spent your time pleasantly there."	304:355, 4A  !
4B	"Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did	304:355, 5B  !
4B	not. They were all very pleasant. I doubt their finding	304:355, 6B  !
4B	me so. I took uneasiness with me, and there was no getting	304:355, 7B  !
4B	rid of it till I was in Mansfield again."	304:355, 8B  !
4A	"The Miss Owens ~ you liked them, did not you?"	304:355, 9A  !
4B	"Yes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected	304:355,10B  !
4B	girls. But I am spoilt, Fanny, for common female society.	304:355,11B  !
4B	Good-humoured, unaffected girls, will not do for a man	304:355,12B  !
4B	who has been used to sensible women. They are two distinct	304:355,13B  !
4B	orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made	304:355,14B  !
4B	me too nice."	304:355,15B  !
4C	"I must speak to you for a few minutes	305:357,15C  !
4C	somewhere;"	305:357,16C  !
4C	"Sad, sad girl| I do not know when I shall	305:357,26C  !
4C	have done scolding you,"	305:357,27C  !
4C	"Ha|"	305:357,38C  !
4C	"am I here	305:357,38C  !
4C	again? The east room. Once only was I in this room	305:358, 1C  !
4C	before|" ~	305:358, 2C  !
4C	"Once only before. Do you remember it? I came to	305:358, 4C  !
4C	rehearse. Your cousin came too; and we had a rehearsal.	305:358, 5C  !
4C	You were our audience and prompter. A delightful	305:358, 6C  !
4C	rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we were, just	305:358, 7C  !
4C	in this part of the room; here was your cousin, here was	305:358, 8C  !
4C	I, here were the chairs. ~ Oh| why will such things ever	305:358, 9C  !
4C	pass away?"	305:358,10C  !
4C	"The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable|	305:358,14C  !
4C	The subject of it so very ~ very ~ what shall I say? He	305:358,15C  !
4C	was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me.	305:358,16C  !
4C	I think I see him now, trying to be as demure and composed	305:358,17C  !
4C	as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches.	305:358,18C  !
4C	""When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state,	305:358,19C  !
4C	matrimony may be called a happy life."" I suppose no	305:358,20C  !
4C	time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks	305:358,21C  !
4C	and voice, as he said those words. It was curious, very	305:358,22C  !
4C	curious, that we should have such a scene to play| If I	305:358,23C  !
4C	had the power of recalling any one week of my existence,	305:358,24C  !
4C	it should be that week, that acting week. Say what you	305:358,25C  !
4C	would, Fanny, it should be \that\; for I never knew such	305:358,26C  !
4C	exquisite happiness in any other. His sturdy spirit to	305:358,27C  !
4C	bend as it did| Oh| it was sweet beyond expression.	305:358,28C  !
4C	But alas| that very evening destroyed it all. That very	305:358,29C  !
4C	evening brought your most unwelcome uncle. Poor Sir Thomas,	305:358,30C  !
4C	who was glad to see you? Yet, Fanny, do not	305:358,31C  !
4C	imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas,	305:358,32C  !
4C	though I certainly did hate him for many a week. No,	305:358,33C  !
4C	I do him justice now. He is just what the head of such	305:358,34C  !
4C	a family should be. Nay, in sober sadness, I believe I	305:358,35C  !
4C	now love you all."	305:358,36C  !
4C	"I have	305:359, 1C  !
4C	had a little fit since I came into this room, as you may	305:359, 2C  !
4C	perceive,"	305:359, 3C  !
4C	"but	305:359, 3C  !
4C	it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable;	305:359, 4C  !
4C	for as to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending	305:359, 5C  !
4C	to do, I have not the heart for it when it comes to the	305:359, 6C  !
4C	point."	305:359, 7C  !
4C	"Good,	305:359, 7C  !
4C	gentle Fanny| when I think of this being the last time of	305:359, 8C  !
4C	seeing you; for I do not know how long ~ I feel it quite	305:359, 9C  !
4C	impossible to do any thing but love you."	305:359,10C  !
4C	"I hate to leave you. I shall see no one half so amiable	305:359,17C  !
4C	where I am going. Who says we shall not be sisters?	305:359,18C  !
4C	I know we shall. I feel that we are born to be connected;	305:359,19C  !
4C	and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear	305:359,20C  !
4C	Fanny."	305:359,21C  !
4A	"But you are only going from one set of friends to another.	305:359,23A  !
4A	You are going to a very particular friend."	305:359,24A  !
4C	"Yes, very true. Mrs% Fraser has been my intimate	305:359,25C  !
4C	friend for years. But I have not the least inclination to	305:359,26C  !
4C	go near her. I can think only of the friends I am leaving;	305:359,27C  !
4C	my excellent sister, yourself, and the Bertrams in general.	305:359,28C  !
4C	You have all so much more \heart\ among you, than one	305:359,29C  !
4C	finds in the world at large. You all give me a feeling of	305:359,30C  !
4C	being able to trust and confide in you; which, in common	305:359,31C  !
4C	intercourse, one knows nothing of. I wish I had settled	305:359,32C  !
4C	with Mrs% Fraser not to go to her till after Easter, a much	305:359,33C  !
4C	better time for the visit ~ but now I cannot put her off.	305:359,34C  !
4C	And when I have done with her, I must go to her sister,	305:359,35C  !
4C	Lady Stornaway, because \she\ was rather my most particular	305:359,36C  !
4C	friend of the two; but I have not cared much for	305:359,37C  !
4C	\her\ these three years."	305:359,38C  !
4C	"How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for	305:360, 5C  !
4C	you up stairs; and setting off to find my way to the east room,	305:360, 6C  !
4C	without having an idea whereabouts it was| How	305:360, 7C  !
4C	well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along;	305:360, 8C  !
4C	and my looking in and seeing you here, sitting at this table	305:360, 9C  !
4C	at work; and then your cousin's astonishment when he	305:360,10C  !
4C	opened the door at seeing me here| To be sure, your	305:360,11C  !
4C	uncle's returning that very evening| There never was	305:360,12C  !
4C	anything quite like it."	305:360,13C  !
4C	"Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie|	305:360,16C  !
4C	Thinking, I hope, of one who is always thinking of you.	305:360,17C  !
4C	Oh| that I could transport you for a short time into our	305:360,18C  !
4C	circle in town, that you might understand how your power	305:360,19C  !
4C	over Henry is thought of there| Oh| the envyings and	305:360,20C  !
4C	heart-burnings of dozens and dozens| the wonder, the	305:360,21C  !
4C	incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have	305:360,22C  !
4C	done| For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero of an	305:360,23C  !
4C	old romance, and glories in his chains. You should come	305:360,24C  !
4C	to London, to know how to estimate your conquest. If	305:360,25C  !
4C	you were to see how he is courted, and how I am courted	305:360,26C  !
4C	for his sake| Now I am well aware, that I shall not be	305:360,27C  !
4C	half so welcome to Mrs% Fraser in consequence of his	305:360,28C  !
4C	situation	305:360,28C  !
4C	with you. When she comes to know the truth, she	305:360,29C  !
4C	will very likely wish me in Northamptonshire again; for	305:360,30C  !
4C	there is a daughter of Mr% Fraser by a first wife, whom she	305:360,31C  !
4C	is wild to get married, and wants Henry to take. Oh|	305:360,32C  !
4C	she has been trying for him to such a degree| Innocent	305:360,33C  !
4C	and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an idea of the	305:360,34C  !
4C	\sensation\ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity	305:360,35C  !
4C	there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall	305:360,36C  !
4C	have to answer| Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever	305:360,37C  !
4C	about your eyes and your teeth, and how you do	305:360,38C  !
4C	your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish Margaret	305:361, 1C  !
4C	were married, for my poor friend's sake, for I look upon	305:361, 2C  !
4C	the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married	305:361, 3C  !
4C	people. And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet	305:361, 4C  !
4C	at the time. We were all delighted. She could not do	305:361, 5C  !
4C	otherwise than accept him, for he was rich, and she had	305:361, 6C  !
4C	nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered, and \exigeant\;	305:361, 7C  !
4C	and wants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of	305:361, 8C  !
4C	five-and-twenty, to be as steady as himself. And my	305:361, 9C  !
4C	friend does not manage him well; she does not seem to	305:361,10C  !
4C	know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of	305:361,11C  !
4C	irritation, which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very	305:361,12C  !
4C	ill-bred. In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal	305:361,13C  !
4C	manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect. Even	305:361,14C  !
4C	Dr% Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister,	305:361,15C  !
4C	and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes	305:361,16C  !
4C	one feel there \is\ attachment; but of that, I shall see	305:361,17C  !
4C	nothing with the Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever,	305:361,18C  !
4C	Fanny. My own sister as a wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as	305:361,19C  !
4C	a husband, are my standards of perfection. Poor Janet	305:361,20C  !
4C	has been sadly taken in; and yet there was nothing	305:361,21C  !
4C	improper on her side; she did not run into the match	305:361,22C  !
4C	inconsiderately, there was no want of foresight. She	305:361,23C  !
4C	took three days to consider of his proposals; and during	305:361,24C  !
4C	those three days asked the advice of every body connected	305:361,25C  !
4C	with her, whose opinion was worth having; and especially	305:361,26C  !
4C	applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the	305:361,27C  !
4C	world made her judgment very generally and deservedly	305:361,28C  !
4C	looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance;	305:361,29C  !
4C	and she was decidedly in favour of Mr% Fraser. This	305:361,30C  !
4C	seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort|	305:361,31C  !
4C	I have not so much to say for my friend Flora,	305:361,32C  !
4C	who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues, for the	305:361,33C  !
4C	sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway, who has about as	305:361,34C  !
4C	much sense, Fanny, as Mr% Rushworth, but much worse	305:361,35C  !
4C	looking, and with a blackguard character. I \had\ my	305:361,36C  !
4C	doubts at the time about her being right, for he has not	305:361,37C  !
4C	even the air of a gentleman, and now, I am sure, she was	305:361,38C  !
4C	wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was dying for Henry the	305:362, 1C  !
4C	first winter she came out. But were I to attempt to tell	305:362, 2C  !
4C	you of all the women whom I have known to be in love	305:362, 3C  !
4C	with him, I should never have done. It is you only, you,	305:362, 4C  !
4C	insensible Fanny, who can think of him with any thing	305:362, 5C  !
4C	like indifference. But are you so insensible as you profess	305:362, 6C  !
4C	yourself? No, no, I see you are not."	305:362, 7C  !
4C	"Excellent creature| I will not teaze you. Every thing	305:362,11C  !
4C	shall take its course. But dear Fanny, you must	305:362,12C  !
4C	allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have	305:362,13C  !
4C	the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is not possible,	305:362,14C  !
4C	but that you must have had some thoughts on the	305:362,15C  !
4C	subject, some surmises as to what might be. You must	305:362,16C  !
4C	have seen that he was trying to please you, by every attention	305:362,17C  !
4C	in his power. Was not he devoted to you at the ball?	305:362,18C  !
4C	And then before the ball, the necklace| Oh| you received	305:362,19C  !
4C	it just as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart	305:362,20C  !
4C	could desire. I remember it perfectly."	305:362,21C  !
4A	"Do you mean then that your brother knew of the	305:362,22A  !
4A	necklace beforehand? Oh| Miss Crawford, \that\ was not	305:362,23A  !
4A	fair."	305:362,24A  !
4C	"Knew of it| it was his own doing entirely, his own	305:362,25C  !
4C	thought. I am ashamed to say, that it had never entered	305:362,26C  !
4C	my head; but I was delighted to act on his proposal, for	305:362,27C  !
4C	both your sakes."	305:362,28C  !
4A	"I will not say,"	305:362,29A  !
4A	"that I was not half	305:362,29A  !
4A	afraid at the time, of its being so; for there was something	305:362,30A  !
4A	in your look that frightened me ~ but not at first ~	305:362,31A  !
4A	I was as unsuspicious of it at first| ~ indeed, indeed I was.	305:362,32A  !
4A	It is as true as that I sit here. And had I had an idea of	305:362,33A  !
4A	it, nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace.	305:362,34A  !
4A	As to your brother's behaviour, certainly I was sensible	305:362,35A  !
4A	of a particularity, I had been sensible of it some little	305:362,36A  !
4A	time, perhaps two or three weeks; but then I considered	305:362,37A  !
4A	it as meaning nothing, I put it down as simply being his	305:362,38A  !
4A	way, and was as far from supposing as from wishing him	305:363, 1A  !
4A	to have any serious thoughts of me. I had not, Miss Crawford,	305:363, 2A  !
4A	been an inattentive observer of what was passing	305:363, 3A  !
4A	between him and some part of this family in the	305:363, 4A  !
4A	summer and autumn. I was quiet, but I was not blind.	305:363, 5A  !
4A	I could not but see that Mr% Crawford allowed himself in	305:363, 6A  !
4A	gallantries which did mean nothing."	305:363, 7A  !
4C	"Ah| I cannot deny it. He has now and then been	305:363, 8C  !
4C	a sad flirt, and cared very little for the havock he might	305:363, 9C  !
4C	be making in young ladies' affections. I have often	305:363,10C  !
4C	scolded him for it, but it is his only fault; and there is	305:363,11C  !
4C	this to be said, that very few young ladies have any affections	305:363,12C  !
4C	worth caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of	305:363,13C  !
4C	fixing one who has been shot at by so many; of having	305:363,14C  !
4C	it in one's power to pay off the debts of one's sex| Oh,	305:363,15C  !
4C	I am sure it is not in woman's nature to refuse such a	305:363,16C  !
4C	triumph."	305:363,17C  !
4A	"I cannot think well of a man	305:363,18A  !
4A	who sports with any woman's feelings; and there may	305:363,19A  !
4A	often be a great deal more suffered than a stander-by can	305:363,20A  !
4A	judge of."	305:363,21A  !
4C	"I do not defend him. I leave him entirely to your	305:363,22C  !
4C	mercy; and when he has got you at Everingham, I do	305:363,23C  !
4C	not care how much you lecture him. But this I will say,	305:363,24C  !
4C	that his fault, the liking to make girls a little in love with	305:363,25C  !
4C	him, is not half so dangerous to a wife's happiness, as a	305:363,26C  !
4C	tendency to fall in love himself, which he has never been	305:363,27C  !
4C	addicted to. And I do seriously and truly believe that	305:363,28C  !
4C	he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any	305:363,29C  !
4C	woman before; that he loves you with all his heart, and	305:363,30C  !
4C	will love you as nearly for ever as possible. If any man	305:363,31C  !
4C	ever loved a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as	305:363,32C  !
4C	much for you."	305:363,33C  !
4C	"I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,"	305:363,36C  !
4C	"than when he had succeeded	305:363,37C  !
4C	in getting your brother's commission."	305:363,38C  !
4A	"Oh| yes. How very, very kind of him|"	305:364, 2A  !
4C	"I know he must have exerted himself very much, for	305:364, 3C  !
4C	I know the parties he had to move. The Admiral hates	305:364, 4C  !
4C	trouble, and scorns asking favours; and there are so many	305:364, 5C  !
4C	young men's claims to be attended to in the same way,	305:364, 6C  !
4C	that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is	305:364, 7C  !
4C	easily put by. What a happy creature William must be|	305:364, 8C  !
4C	I wish we could see him."	305:364, 9C  !
4C	"I should like to	305:364,16C  !
4C	sit talking with you here all day, but we must not forget	305:364,17C  !
4C	the ladies below, and so good bye, my dear, my amiable,	305:364,18C  !
4C	my excellent Fanny, for though we shall nominally part	305:364,19C  !
4C	in the breakfast parlour, I must take leave of you here.	305:364,20C  !
4C	And I do take leave, longing for a happy re-union, and	305:364,21C  !
4C	trusting, that when we meet again, it will be under circumstances	305:364,22C  !
4C	which may open our hearts to each other	305:364,23C  !
4C	without any remnant or shadow of reserve."	305:364,24C  !
4C	"I shall see your cousin in town soon; he talks of being	305:364,27C  !
4C	there tolerably soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the	305:364,28C  !
4C	course of the spring; and your eldest cousin and the	305:364,29C  !
4C	Rushworths and Julia I am sure of meeting again and	305:364,30C  !
4C	again, and all but you. I have two favours to ask,	305:364,31C  !
4C	Fanny; one is your correspondence. You must write to	305:364,32C  !
4C	me. And the other, that you will often call on Mrs% Grant	305:364,33C  !
4C	and make her amends for my being gone."	305:364,34C  !
4E	"then so it shall	306:368,37E  !
4E	be,"	306:368,38E  !
4F	"That may be, sister," ~	306:371,16F  !
4F	"I dare say you are very right, but I am sure I shall miss	306:371,17F  !
4F	her very much."	306:371,18F  !
4B	"And \I\ shall write to you,	306:374, 2B  !
4B	Fanny, when I have any thing worth writing about; any thing	306:374, 3B  !
4B	to say, that I think you will like to hear, and that	306:374, 4B  !
4B	you will not hear so soon from any other quarter."	306:374, 5B  !
4A	"What have you got there, my love?"	307:386,11A  !
4A	"come and shew it to me."	307:386,12A  !
4C	"and now that I have begun,"	309:393,14C  !
4C	"my letter will not be worth your reading, for	309:393,15C  !
4C	there will be no little offering of love at the end, no three or	309:393,16C  !
4C	four lines passione=es from the most devoted H% C% in the	309:393,17C  !
4C	world, for Henry is in Norfolk; business called him to	309:393,18C  !
4C	Everingham ten days ago, or perhaps he only pretended	309:393,19C  !
4C	the call, for the sake of being travelling at the same time	309:393,20C  !
4C	that you were. But there he is, and, by the by, his absence	309:393,21C  !
4C	may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister's	309:393,22C  !
4C	in writing, for there has been no ""well, Mary, when do	309:393,23C  !
4C	you write to Fanny? ~ is not it time for you to write to	309:393,24C  !
4C	Fanny?"" to spur me on. At last, after various attempts at	309:393,25C  !
4C	meeting, I have seen your cousins, ""dear Julia and dearest	309:393,26C  !
4C	Mrs% Rushworth;"" they found me at home yesterday, and	309:393,27C  !
4C	we were glad to see each other again. We \seemed\ \very\ glad	309:393,28C  !
4C	to see each other, and I do really think we were a little. ~	309:393,29C  !
4C	We had a vast deal to say. ~ Shall I tell you how Mrs% Rushworth	309:393,30C  !
4C	looked when your name was mentioned? I did not	309:393,31C  !
4C	use to think her wanting in self possession, but she had not	309:393,32C  !
4C	quite enough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the	309:394, 1C  !
4C	whole Julia was in the best looks of the two, at least after	309:394, 2C  !
4C	you were spoken of. There was no recovering the complexion	309:394, 3C  !
4C	from the moment that I spoke of ""Fanny"", and	309:394, 4C  !
4C	spoke of her as a sister should. ~ But Mrs% Rushworth's day	309:394, 5C  !
4C	of good looks will come; we have cards for her first party	309:394, 6C  !
4C	on the 28th. ~ Then she will be in beauty, for she will open	309:394, 7C  !
4C	one of the best houses in Wimpole Street. I was in it two	309:394, 8C  !
4C	years ago, when it was Lady Lascelles's, and prefer it to	309:394, 9C  !
4C	almost any I know in London, and certainly she will then	309:394,10C  !
4C	feel ~ to use a vulgar phrase ~ that she has got her penny-worth	309:394,11C  !
4C	for her penny. Henry could not have afforded her	309:394,12C  !
4C	such a house. I hope she will recollect it, and be satisfied,	309:394,13C  !
4C	as well she may, with moving the queen of a palace, though	309:394,14C  !
4C	the king may appear best in the back ground, and as	309:394,15C  !
4C	I have no desire to tease her, I shall never \force\ your name	309:394,16C  !
4C	upon her again. She will grow sober by degrees. ~ From	309:394,17C  !
4C	all that I hear and guess, Baron Wildenhaim's attentions	309:394,18C  !
4C	to	309:394,18C  !
4C	Julia continue, but I do not know that he has any serious	309:394,19C  !
4C	encouragement. She ought to do better. A poor honourable	309:394,20C  !
4C	is no catch, and I cannot imagine any liking in the	309:394,21C  !
4C	case, for, take away his rants, and the poor Baron has	309:394,22C  !
4C	nothing. What a difference a vowel makes| ~ if his rents	309:394,23C  !
4C	were but equal to his rants| ~ Your cousin Edmund moves	309:394,24C  !
4C	slowly; detained, perchance, by parish duties. There	309:394,25C  !
4C	may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted.	309:394,26C  !
4C	I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a	309:394,27C  !
4C	\young\ one. Adieu, my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long	309:394,28C  !
4C	letter from London; write me a pretty one in reply to	309:394,29C  !
4C	gladden Henry's eyes, when he comes back ~ and send me	309:394,30C  !
4C	an account of all the dashing young captains whom you	309:394,31C  !
4C	disdain for his sake."	309:394,32C  !
4A	"William's friend"	310:399,22A  !
4D	"then by this time	310:401,10D  !
4D	it is all settled,"	310:401,11D  !
4D	"It was a	310:401,15D  !
4D	lovely morning, and at that season of the year a fine morning	310:401,16D  !
4D	so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody	310:401,17D  !
4D	not to delay their exercise;"	310:401,18D  !
4D	"Would she not then persuade	310:401,24D  !

4D	comes for you?"	311:410,18D  !
4A	"I do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet	311:410,19A  !
4A	from my aunt. Perhaps I may be to stay longer. It may	311:410,20A  !

4D	of any single being in the family. I am aware	311:410,27D  !
4D	that you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas	311:410,28D  !

4D	her as well as I do, I am sure you will agree that she does,	311:410,38D  !
4D	and that she ought never to be long banished from the free	311:411, 1D  !

4D	such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his	311:412, 2D  !

4D	I do not wish to displace him ~ provided he does not try	311:412, 7D  !
4D	to displace \me\; ~ but it would be simple to be duped by	311:412, 8D  !
4D	a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me ~ and	311:412, 9D  !
4D	worse than simple to let him give me a hard-hearted,	311:412,10D  !
4D	griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man,	311:412,11D  !
4D	to whom I have given half a promise already. ~ Would	311:412,12D  !

4C	has been down to Portsmouth to see you; that he had	312:415, 8C  !
4C	a delightful walk with you to the Dock-yard last Saturday,	312:415, 9C  !
4C	and one still more to be dwelt on the next day, on the	312:415,10C  !
4C	ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and	312:415,11C  !
4C	your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the	312:415,12C  !
4C	most delicious harmony, and afforded sensations which	312:415,13C  !
4C	are to raise ecstacy even in retrospect. This, as well as	312:415,14C  !
4C	I understand, is to be the substance of my information.	312:415,15C  !
4C	He makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be	312:415,16C  !
4C	communicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth, and	312:415,17C  !
4C	these two said walks, and his introduction to your family,	312:415,18C  !
4C	especially to a fair sister of your's, a fine girl of fifteen,	312:415,19C  !
4C	who was of the party on the ramparts, taking her first	312:415,20C  !
4C	lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for writing	312:415,21C  !
4C	much, but it would be out of place if I had, for this is to	312:415,22C  !
4C	be a mere letter of business, penned for the purpose of	312:415,23C  !
4C	conveying necessary information, which could not be	312:415,24C  !
4C	delayed without risk of evil. My dear, dear Fanny, if I	312:415,25C  !
4C	had you here, how I would talk to you| ~ You should	312:415,26C  !
4C	listen to me till you were tired, and advise me till you were	312:415,27C  !
4C	tired still more; but it is impossible to put an hundredth	312:415,28C  !
4C	part of my great mind on paper, so I will abstain altogether,	312:415,29C  !
4C	and leave you to guess what you like. I have no news	312:415,30C  !
4C	for you. You have politics of course; and it would be	312:415,31C  !
4C	too bad to plague you with the names of people and	312:415,32C  !
4C	parties, that fill up my time. I ought to have sent you	312:415,33C  !
4C	an account of your cousin's first party, but I was lazy,	312:416, 1C  !
4C	and now it is too long ago; suffice it, that every thing	312:416, 2C  !
4C	was just as it ought to be, in a style that any of her	312:416, 3C  !
4C	connections	312:416, 3C  !
4C	must have been gratified to witness, and that her	312:416, 4C  !
4C	own dress and manners did her the greatest credit. My	312:416, 5C  !
4C	friend Mrs% Fraser is mad for such a house, and it would	312:416, 6C  !
4C	not make \me\ miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after	312:416, 7C  !
4C	Easter. She seems in high spirits, and very happy. I	312:416, 8C  !
4C	fancy Lord S% is very good-humoured and pleasant in his	312:416, 9C  !
4C	own family, and I do not think him so very ill-looking as	312:416,10C  !
4C	I did, at least one sees many worse. He will not do by	312:416,11C  !
4C	the side of your cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned	312:416,12C  !
4C	hero, what shall I say? If I avoided his name entirely,	312:416,13C  !
4C	it would look suspicious. I will say, then, that we have	312:416,14C  !
4C	seen him two or three times, and that my friends here	312:416,15C  !
4C	are very much struck with his gentleman-like appearance.	312:416,16C  !
4C	Mrs% Fraser (no bad judge), declares she knows but three	312:416,17C  !
4C	men in town who have so good a person, height, and air;	312:416,18C  !
4C	and I must confess, when he dined here the other day,	312:416,19C  !
4C	there were none to compare with him, and we were a party	312:416,20C  !
4C	of sixteen. Luckily there is no distinction of dress now-a-days	312:416,21C  !
4C	to tell tales, but ~ but ~ but.	312:416,22C  !
4C	Your's, affectionately."	312:416,23C  !
4C	"I had almost forgot (it was Edmund's fault, he gets	312:416,24C  !
4C	into my head more than does me good), one very material	312:416,25C  !
4C	thing I had to say from Henry and myself, I mean about	312:416,26C  !
4C	our taking you back into Northamptonshire. My dear	312:416,27C  !
4C	little creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your	312:416,28C  !
4C	pretty looks. Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty	312:416,29C  !
4C	and health. My poor aunt always felt affected, if within	312:416,30C  !
4C	ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral of course never	312:416,31C  !
4C	believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service and	312:416,32C  !
4C	Henry's, at an hour's notice. I should like the scheme,	312:416,33C  !
4C	and we would make a little circuit, and shew you	312:416,34C  !
4C	Everingham in our way, and perhaps you would not	312:416,35C  !
4C	mind passing through London, and seeing the inside of	312:416,36C  !
4C	St% George's, Hanover-Square. Only keep your cousin	312:416,37C  !
4C	Edmund from me at such a time, I should not like to be	312:416,38C  !
4C	tempted. What a long letter| ~ one word more. Henry	312:417, 1C  !
4C	I find has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some	312:417, 2C  !
4C	business that \you\ approve, but this cannot possibly be	312:417, 3C  !
4C	permitted before the middle of next week, that is, he cannot	312:417, 4C  !
4C	any how be spared till after the 14th, for \we\ have a	312:417, 5C  !
4C	party that evening. The value of a man like Henry on	312:417, 6C  !
4C	such an occasion, is what you can have no conception of;	312:417, 7C  !
4C	so you must take it upon my word, to be inestimable.	312:417, 8C  !
4C	He will see the Rushworths, which I own I am not sorry	312:417, 9C  !
4C	for ~ having a little curiosity ~ and so I think has he,	312:417,10C  !
4C	though he will not acknowledge it."	312:417,11C  !
4B	"\Mansfield Park\.	313:420, 8B  !
4B	"My dear Fanny,	313:420, 9B  !
4B	"Excuse me that I have not written before. Crawford	313:420,10B  !
4B	told me that you were wishing to hear from me, but I	313:420,11B  !
4B	found it impossible to write from London, and persuaded	313:420,12B  !
4B	myself that you would understand my silence. ~ Could I	313:420,13B  !
4B	have sent a few happy lines, they should not have been	313:420,14B  !
4B	wanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power.	313:420,15B  !
4B	~ I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than	313:420,16B  !
4B	when I left it. My hopes are much weaker. ~ You are	313:420,17B  !
4B	probably aware of this already. ~ So very fond of you as	313:420,18B  !
4B	Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell	313:420,19B  !
4B	you enough of her own feelings, to furnish a tolerable guess	313:420,20B  !
4B	at mine. ~ I will not be prevented, however, from making	313:420,21B  !
4B	my own communication. Our confidences in you need not	313:420,22B  !
4B	clash. ~ I ask no questions. ~ There is something soothing	313:420,23B  !
4B	in the idea, that we have the same friend, and that	313:420,24B  !
4B	whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist	313:420,25B  !
4B	between us, we are united in our love of you. ~ It will be	313:420,26B  !
4B	a comfort to me to tell you how things now are, and what	313:420,27B  !
4B	are my present plans, if plans I can be said to have. ~ I	313:420,28B  !
4B	have been returned since Saturday. I was three weeks	313:420,29B  !
4B	in London, and saw her (for London) very often. I had	313:420,30B  !
4B	every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably	313:420,31B  !
4B	expected. I dare say I was \not\ reasonable in carrying	313:420,32B  !
4B	with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield.	313:420,33B  !
4B	It was her manner, however, rather than any unfrequency	313:421, 1B  !
4B	of meeting. Had she been different when I did	313:421, 2B  !
4B	see her, I should have made no complaint, but from the	313:421, 3B  !
4B	very first she was altered; my first reception was so unlike	313:421, 4B  !
4B	what I had hoped, that I had almost resolved on leaving	313:421, 5B  !
4B	London again directly. ~ I need not particularize. You	313:421, 6B  !
4B	know the weak side of her character, and may imagine	313:421, 7B  !
4B	the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me.	313:421, 8B  !
4B	She was in high spirits, and surrounded by those who were	313:421, 9B  !
4B	giving all the support of their own bad sense to her too	313:421,10B  !
4B	lively mind. I do not like Mrs% Fraser. She is a cold-hearted,	313:421,11B  !
4B	vain woman, who has married entirely from convenience,	313:421,12B  !
4B	and though evidently unhappy in her marriage,	313:421,13B  !
4B	places her disappointment, not to faults of judgment or	313:421,14B  !
4B	temper, or disproportion of age, but to her being after all,	313:421,15B  !
4B	less affluent than many of her acquaintance, especially	313:421,16B  !
4B	than her sister, Lady Stornaway, and is the determined	313:421,17B  !
4B	supporter of every thing mercenary and ambitious, provided	313:421,18B  !
4B	it be only mercenary and ambitious enough. I look	313:421,19B  !
4B	upon her intimacy with those two sisters, as the greatest	313:421,20B  !
4B	misfortune of her life and mine. They have been leading	313:421,21B  !
4B	her astray for years. Could she be detached from them|	313:421,22B  !
4B	~ and sometimes I do not despair of it, for the affection	313:421,23B  !
4B	appears to me principally on their side. They are very	313:421,24B  !
4B	fond of her; but I am sure she does not love them as she	313:421,25B  !
4B	loves you. When I think of her great attachment to you,	313:421,26B  !
4B	indeed, and the whole of her judicious, upright conduct	313:421,27B  !
4B	as a sister, she appears a very different creature, capable	313:421,28B  !
4B	of every thing noble, and I am ready to blame myself for	313:421,29B  !
4B	a too harsh construction of a playful manner. I cannot	313:421,30B  !
4B	give her up, Fanny. She is the only woman in the world	313:421,31B  !
4B	whom I could ever think of as a wife. If I did not believe	313:421,32B  !
4B	that she had some regard for me, of course I should not	313:421,33B  !
4B	say this, but I do believe it. I am convinced, that she is	313:421,34B  !
4B	not without a decided preference. I have no jealousy of	313:421,35B  !
4B	any individual. It is the influence of the fashionable	313:421,36B  !
4B	world altogether that I am jealous of. It is the habits	313:421,37B  !
4B	of wealth that I fear. Her ideas are not higher than her	313:421,38B  !
4B	own fortune may warrant, but they are beyond what our	313:422, 1B  !
4B	incomes united could authorise. There is comfort, however,	313:422, 2B  !
4B	even here. I could better bear to lose her, because	313:422, 3B  !
4B	not rich enough, than because of my profession. That	313:422, 4B  !
4B	would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices,	313:422, 5B  !
4B	which, in fact, I am scarcely justified in asking; and if I	313:422, 6B  !
4B	am refused, \that\, I think, will be the honest motive. Her	313:422, 7B  !
4B	prejudices, I trust, are not so strong as they were. You	313:422, 8B  !
4B	have my thoughts exactly as they arise, my dear Fanny;	313:422, 9B  !
4B	perhaps they are some times contradictory, but it will not	313:422,10B  !
4B	be a less faithful picture of my mind. Having once begun,	313:422,11B  !
4B	it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel. I cannot give	313:422,12B  !
4B	her up. Connected, as we already are, and, I hope, are	313:422,13B  !
4B	to be, to give up Mary Crawford, would be to give up the	313:422,14B  !
4B	society of some of those most dear to me, to banish myself	313:422,15B  !
4B	from the very houses and friends whom, under any other	313:422,16B  !
4B	distress, I should turn to for consolation. The loss of	313:422,17B  !
4B	Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford	313:422,18B  !
4B	and of Fanny. Were it a decided thing, an actual	313:422,19B  !
4B	refusal, I hope I should know how to bear it, and how to	313:422,20B  !
4B	endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart ~ and in the	313:422,21B  !
4B	course of a few years ~ but I am writing nonsense ~ were	313:422,22B  !
4B	I refused, I must bear it; and till I am, I can never cease	313:422,23B  !
4B	to try for her. This is the truth. The only question is	313:422,24B  !
4B	\how\? What may be the likeliest means? I have sometimes	313:422,25B  !
4B	thought of going to London again after Easter, and	313:422,26B  !
4B	sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns to	313:422,27B  !
4B	Mansfield. Even now, she speaks with pleasure of being	313:422,28B  !
4B	in Mansfield in June; but June is at a great distance, and	313:422,29B  !
4B	I believe I shall write to her. I have nearly determined	313:422,30B  !
4B	on explaining myself by letter. To be at an early certainty	313:422,31B  !
4B	is a material object. My present state is miserably	313:422,32B  !
4B	irksome. Considering every thing, I think a letter will	313:422,33B  !
4B	be decidedly the best method of explanation. I shall be	313:422,34B  !
4B	able to write much that I could not say, and shall be giving	313:422,35B  !
4B	her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer,	313:422,36B  !
4B	and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an	313:422,37B  !
4B	immediate hasty impulse; I think I am. My greatest	313:422,38B  !
4B	danger would lie in her consulting Mrs% Fraser, and I at	313:423, 1B  !
4B	a distance, unable to help my own cause. A letter exposes	313:423, 2B  !
4B	to all the evil of consultation, and where the mind is any thing	313:423, 3B  !
4B	short of perfect decision, an adviser may, in an	313:423, 4B  !
4B	unlucky moment, lead it to do what it may afterwards	313:423, 5B  !
4B	regret. I must think this matter over a little. This long	313:423, 6B  !
4B	letter, full of my own concerns alone, will be enough to	313:423, 7B  !
4B	tire even the friendship of a Fanny. The last time I saw	313:423, 8B  !
4B	Crawford was at Mrs% Fraser's party. I am more and	313:423, 9B  !
4B	more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him. There	313:423,10B  !
4B	is not a shadow of wavering. He thoroughly knows his	313:423,11B  !
4B	own mind, and acts up to his resolutions ~ an inestimable	313:423,12B  !
4B	quality. I could not see him, and my eldest sister in the	313:423,13B  !
4B	same room, without recollecting what you once told me,	313:423,14B  !
4B	and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends.	313:423,15B  !
4B	There was marked coolness on her side. They scarcely	313:423,16B  !
4B	spoke. I saw him draw back surprised, and I was sorry	313:423,17B  !
4B	that Mrs% Rushworth should resent any former supposed	313:423,18B  !
4B	slight to Miss Bertram. You will wish to hear my opinion	313:423,19B  !
4B	of Maria's degree of comfort as a wife. There is no appearance	313:423,20B  !
4B	of unhappiness. I hope they get on pretty well	313:423,21B  !
4B	together. I dined twice in Wimpole Street, and might	313:423,22B  !
4B	have been there oftener, but it is mortifying to be with	313:423,23B  !
4B	Rushworth as a brother. Julia seems to enjoy London	313:423,24B  !
4B	exceedingly. I had little enjoyment there ~ but have less	313:423,25B  !
4B	here. We are not a lively party. You are very much	313:423,26B  !
4B	wanted. I miss you more than I can express. My	313:423,27B  !
4B	mother desires her best love, and hopes to hear from you	313:423,28B  !
4B	soon. She talks of you almost every hour, and I am sorry	313:423,29B  !
4B	to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without	313:423,30B  !
4B	you. My Father means to fetch you himself, but it will	313:423,31B  !
4B	not be till after Easter, when he has business in town.	313:423,32B  !
4B	You are happy at Portsmouth, I hope, but this must not	313:423,33B  !
4B	be a yearly visit. I want you at home, that I may have	313:423,34B  !
4B	your opinion about Thornton Lacey. I have little heart	313:423,35B  !
4B	for extensive improvements till I know that it will ever	313:423,36B  !
4B	have a mistress. I think I shall certainly write. It is	313:423,37B  !
4B	quite settled that the Grants go to Bath; they leave	313:423,38B  !
4B	Mansfield on Monday. I am glad of it. I am not comfortable	313:424, 1B  !
4B	enough to be fit for any body; but your aunt	313:424, 2B  !
4B	seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield	313:424, 3B  !
4B	news should fall to my pen instead of her's. Your's ever,	313:424, 4B  !
4B	my dearest Fanny."	313:424, 5B  !

4A	\them\ astray. They have all, perhaps, been corrupting	313:424,26A  !
4A	one another; but if they are so much fonder of her than	313:424,27A  !
4A	she is of them, she is the less likely to have been hurt,	313:424,28A  !

4A	whom he could ever think of as a wife."" I firmly believe	313:424,30A  !

4F	alarming intelligence, which I make no doubt will give	313:425,37F  !
4F	you much concern."	313:425,38F  !
4F	"This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,"	313:426,19F  !
4F	"has agitated us exceedingly, and we cannot prevent	313:426,21F  !

4F	will not leave me on this distressing occasion, as	313:426,26F  !
4F	it would be too trying for me. We shall greatly miss	313:426,27F  !
4F	Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he will	313:426,28F  !
4F	find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might	313:426,29F  !

4F	Mansfield shortly, which Sir Thomas proposes should be	313:426,31F  !

4F	to see him, that I do not know what to do. I am sure he	313:427,25F  !
4F	has been very ill. Poor Tom, I am quite grieved for him,	313:427,26F  !

4C	directly. This is my modest request and expectation,	314:433,22C  !
4C	for you are so good, that I depend upon being treated	314:433,23C  !
4C	better than I deserve ~ and I write now to beg an immediate	314:433,24C  !
4C	answer. I want to know the state of things at	314:433,25C  !
4C	Mansfield Park, and you, no doubt, are perfectly able to	314:433,26C  !
4C	give it. One should be a brute not to feel for the distress	314:433,27C  !
4C	they are in ~ and from what I hear, poor Mr% Bertram has	314:433,28C  !
4C	a bad chance of ultimate recovery. I thought little of	314:433,29C  !
4C	his illness at first. I looked upon him as the sort of person	314:433,30C  !
4C	to be made a fuss with, and to make a fuss himself in any	314:433,31C  !
4C	trifling disorder, and was chiefly concerned for those who	314:433,32C  !
4C	had to nurse him; but now it is confidently asserted that	314:433,33C  !
4C	he is really in a decline, that the symptoms are most	314:433,34C  !
4C	alarming, and that part of the family, at least, are aware	314:433,35C  !
4C	of it. If it be so, I am sure you must be included in that	314:433,36C  !
4C	part, that discerning part, and therefore intreat you to	314:433,37C  !
4C	let me know how far I have been rightly informed. I need	314:433,38C  !
4C	not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been	314:434, 1C  !
4C	any mistake, but the report is so prevalent, that I confess	314:434, 2C  !
4C	I cannot help trembling. To have such a fine young	314:434, 3C  !
4C	man cut off in the flower of his days, is most melancholy.	314:434, 4C  !
4C	Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully. I really am quite	314:434, 5C  !
4C	agitated on the subject. Fanny, Fanny, I see you smile,	314:434, 6C  !
4C	and look cunning, but upon my honour, I never bribed	314:434, 7C  !
4C	a physician in my life. Poor young man| ~ If he is to	314:434, 8C  !
4C	die, there will be \two\ poor young men less in the world;	314:434, 9C  !
4C	and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one,	314:434,10C  !
4C	that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands	314:434,11C  !
4C	more deserving of them. It was a foolish precipitation	314:434,12C  !
4C	last Christmas, but the evil of a few days may be blotted	314:434,13C  !
4C	out in part. Varnish and gilding hide many stains. It	314:434,14C  !
4C	will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name. With	314:434,15C  !
4C	real affection, Fanny, like mine, more might be overlooked.	314:434,16C  !
4C	Write to me by return of post, judge of my	314:434,17C  !
4C	anxiety, and do not trifle with it. Tell me the real truth,	314:434,18C  !
4C	as you have it from the fountain head. And now, do not	314:434,19C  !
4C	trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or	314:434,20C  !
4C	your own. Believe me, they are not only natural, they	314:434,21C  !
4C	are philanthropic and virtuous. I put it to your conscience,	314:434,22C  !
4C	whether ""Sir Edmund"" would not do more good	314:434,23C  !
4C	with all the Bertram property, than any other possible	314:434,24C  !
4C	""Sir."" Had the Grants been at home, I would not have	314:434,25C  !
4C	troubled you, but you are now the only one I can apply	314:434,26C  !
4C	to for the truth, his sisters not being within my reach.	314:434,27C  !
4C	Mrs% R% has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers	314:434,28C  !
4C	at Twickenham (as to be sure you know), and is not yet	314:434,29C  !
4C	returned; and Julia is with the cousins, who live near	314:434,30C  !
4C	Bedford Square; but I forgot their name and street.	314:434,31C  !
4C	Could I immediately apply to either, however, I should	314:434,32C  !
4C	still prefer you, because it strikes me, that they have all	314:434,33C  !
4C	along been so unwilling to have their own amusements	314:434,34C  !
4C	cut up, as to shut their eyes to the truth. I suppose,	314:434,35C  !
4C	Mrs% R%'s Easter holidays will not last much longer; no	314:434,36C  !
4C	doubt they are thorough holidays to her. The Aylmers	314:434,37C  !
4C	are pleasant people; and her husband away, she can have	314:434,38C  !
4C	nothing but enjoyment. I give her credit for promoting	314:435, 1C  !
4C	his going dutifully down to Bath, to fetch his mother;	314:435, 2C  !
4C	but how will she and the dowager agree in one house?	314:435, 3C  !
4C	Henry is not at hand, so I have nothing to say from him.	314:435, 4C  !
4C	Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again	314:435, 5C  !
4C	long ago, but for this illness? ~ Yours ever, Mary."	314:435, 6C  !

4C	the old lady is come. Now do not make yourself	314:435,11C  !
4C	uneasy with any queer fancies, because he has been spending	314:435,12C  !
4C	a few days at Richmond. He does it every spring.	314:435,13C  !
4C	Be assured, he cares for nobody but you. At this very	314:435,14C  !
4C	moment, he is wild to see you, and occupied only in contriving	314:435,15C  !
4C	the means for doing so, and for making his pleasure	314:435,16C  !

4C	be gratifying to see them all again, and a little addition	314:435,23C  !
4C	of society might be of infinite use to them; and, as to	314:435,24C  !
4C	yourself, you must feel yourself to be so wanted there,	314:435,25C  !
4C	that you cannot in conscience (conscientious as you are,)	314:435,26C  !
4C	keep away, when you have the means of returning. I have	314:435,27C  !
4C	not time or patience to give half Henry's messages; be	314:435,28C  !

4B	for my mother's sake. I shall be at Portsmouth the	315:442,38B  !
4B	morning after you receive this, and hope to find you ready	315:443, 1B  !
4B	to set off for Mansfield. My Father wishes you to invite	315:443, 2B  !
4B	Susan to go with you, for a few months. Settle it as you	315:443, 3B  !
4B	like; say what is proper; I am sure you will feel such	315:443, 4B  !
4B	an instance of his kindness at such a moment| Do justice	315:443, 5B  !
4B	to his meaning, however I may confuse it. You may	315:443, 6B  !
4B	imagine something of my present state. There is no end	315:443, 7B  !
4B	of the evil let loose upon us. You will see me early, by	315:443, 8B  !
4B	the mail. Your's, &c%"	315:443, 9B  !
4B	"My	315:444,33B  !
4B	Fanny ~ my only sister ~ my only comfort now."	315:444,34B  !
4B	"Have you breakfasted? ~ When	315:445, 2B  !
4B	shall you be ready? ~ Does Susan go?"	315:445, 3B  !
4B	"No wonder ~ you must feel it ~ you must	315:446,13B  !
4B	suffer. How a man who had once loved, could desert you|	315:446,14B  !
4B	But \your's\ ~ your regard was new compared with ~	315:446,15B  !
4B	Fanny, think of \me\|"	315:446,16B  !
4F	"Dear Fanny| now I shall be comfortable."	315:447,16F  !
4C	"I heard you were in town,"	316:454,20C  !
4B	said she ~	316:454,21B  !
4C	"I wanted to see you. Let us talk over this sad	316:454,21C  !
4C	business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?"	316:454,22C  !
4C	~	316:454,23C  !
4B	"I could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke.	316:454,23B  !
4B	She felt reproved. Sometimes how quick to feel| With	316:454,24B  !
4B	a graver look and voice she then added ~	316:454,25B  !
4C	"I do not mean	316:454,25C  !
4C	to defend Henry at your sister's expense."	316:454,26C  !
4B	So she began ~	316:454,26B  !
4B	but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit ~ is hardly fit to	316:454,27B  !
4B	be	316:454,27B  !
4B	repeated to you. I cannot recall all her words. I would	316:454,28B  !
4B	not dwell upon them if I could. Their substance was	316:454,29B  !
4B	great anger at the \folly\ of each. She reprobated her	316:454,30B  !
4B	brother's folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he	316:454,31B  !
4B	had never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman	316:454,32B  !
4B	he adored; but still more the folly of ~ poor Maria, in	316:454,33B  !
4B	sacrificing such a situation, plunging into such difficulties,	316:454,34B  !
4B	under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long	316:454,35B  !
4B	ago made his indifference clear. Guess what I must have	316:454,36B  !
4B	felt. To hear the woman whom ~ no harsher name than	316:454,37B  !
4B	folly given| ~ So voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass	316:454,38B  !
4B	it| ~ No reluctance, no horror, no feminine ~ shall I say?	316:455, 1B  !
4B	no modest loathings| ~ This is what the world does. For	316:455, 2B  !
4B	where, Fanny, shall we find a woman whom nature had so	316:455, 3B  !
4B	richly endowed? ~ Spoilt, spoilt| ~"	316:455, 4B  !
4B	"I will tell you every thing, and then	316:455, 6B  !
4B	have done for ever. She saw it only as folly, and that	316:455, 7B  !
4B	folly stamped only by exposure. The want of common	316:455, 8B  !
4B	discretion, of caution ~ his going down to Richmond for	316:455, 9B  !
4B	the whole time of her being at Twickenham ~ her putting	316:455,10B  !
4B	herself in the power of a servant; ~ it was the detection	316:455,11B  !
4B	in short ~ Oh| Fanny, it was the detection, not the	316:455,12B  !
4B	offence which she reprobated. It was the imprudence	316:455,13B  !
4B	which had brought things to extremity, and obliged her	316:455,14B  !
4B	brother to give up every dearer plan, in order to fly with	316:455,15B  !
4B	her."	316:455,16B  !
4A	"And what,"	316:455,17A  !
4A	"what could you say?"	316:455,18A  !
4B	"Nothing, nothing to be understood. I was like a man	316:455,19B  !
4B	stunned. She went on, began to talk of you; ~ yes, then	316:455,20B  !
4B	she began to talk of you, regretting, as well she might,	316:455,21B  !
4B	the loss of such a ~. There she spoke very rationally.	316:455,22B  !
4B	But she always has done justice to you.	316:455,23B  !
4C	""He has thrown	316:455,23C  !
4C	away,""	316:455,24C  !
4B	said she,	316:455,24B  !
4C	""such a woman as he will never see again.	316:455,24C  !
4C	She would have fixed him, she would have made him happy	316:455,25C  !
4C	for ever."" ~	316:455,26C  !
4B	My dearest Fanny, I am giving you I hope	316:455,26B  !
4B	more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might	316:455,27B  !
4B	have been ~ but what never can be now. You do not	316:455,28B  !
4B	wish me to be silent? ~ if you do, give me but a look,	316:455,29B  !
4B	a word, and I have done."	316:455,30B  !
4B	"Thank God|"	316:455,32B  !
4B	"We were all disposed to	316:455,32B  !
4B	wonder ~ but it seems to have been the merciful appointment	316:455,33B  !
4B	of Providence that the heart which knew no guile,	316:455,34B  !
4B	should not suffer. She spoke of you with high praise and	316:455,35B  !
4B	warm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash	316:455,36B  !
4B	of evil ~ for in the midst of it she could exclaim	316:455,37B  !
4C	""Why,	316:455,37C  !
4C	would not she have him? It is all her fault. Simple	316:455,38C  !
4C	girl| ~ I shall never forgive her. Had she accepted him	316:456, 1C  !
4C	as she ought, they might now have been on the point of	316:456, 2C  !
4C	marriage, and Henry would have been too happy and too	316:456, 3C  !
4C	busy to want any other object. He would have taken	316:456, 4C  !
4C	no pains to be on terms with Mrs% Rushworth again. It	316:456, 5C  !
4C	would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation, in	316:456, 6C  !
4C	yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.""	316:456, 7C  !
4B	Could	316:456, 8B  !
4B	you have believed it possible? ~ But the charm is broken.	316:456, 9B  !
4B	My eyes are opened."	316:456,10B  !
4A	"Cruel|"	316:456,10A  !
4A	"quite cruel| At such a	316:456,10A  !
4A	moment to give way to gaiety and to speak with lightness,	316:456,11A  !
4A	and to you| ~ Absolute cruelty."	316:456,12A  !
4B	"Cruelty, do you call it? ~ We differ there. No, her's	316:456,13B  !
4B	is not a cruel nature. I do not consider her as meaning	316:456,14B  !
4B	to wound my feelings. The evil lies yet deeper; in her	316:456,15B  !
4B	total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings,	316:456,16B  !
4B	in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her	316:456,17B  !
4B	to treat the subject as she did. She was speaking only, as	316:456,18B  !
4B	she had been used to hear others speak, as she imagined	316:456,19B  !
4B	every body else would speak. Her's are not faults of	316:456,20B  !
4B	temper. She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain	316:456,21B  !
4B	to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot but	316:456,22B  !
4B	think that for me, for my feelings, she would ~ Her's are	316:456,23B  !
4B	faults of principle, Fanny, of blunted delicacy and a corrupted,	316:456,24B  !
4B	vitiated mind. Perhaps it is best for me ~ since	316:456,25B  !
4B	it leaves me so little to regret. Not so, however. Gladly	316:456,26B  !
4B	would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her,	316:456,27B  !
4B	rather than have to think of her as I do. I told her so."	316:456,28B  !
4A	"Did you?"	316:456,29A  !
4B	"Yes, when I left her I told her so."	316:456,30B  !
4A	"How long were you together?"	316:456,31A  !
4B	"Five and twenty minutes. Well, she went on to say,	316:456,32B  !
4B	that what remained now to be done, was to bring about	316:456,33B  !
4B	a marriage between them. She spoke of it, Fanny, with	316:456,34B  !
4B	a steadier voice than I can."	316:456,35B  !
4C	"We must persuade	316:456,36C  !
4C	Henry to marry her,"	316:456,37C  !
4B	said she,	316:456,37B  !
4C	"and what with honour,	316:456,37C  !
4C	and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from	316:456,38C  !
4C	Fanny, I do not despair of it. Fanny he must give up.	316:457, 1C  !
4C	I do not think that even \he\ could now hope to succeed	316:457, 2C  !
4C	with one of her stamp, and therefore I hope we may find	316:457, 3C  !
4C	no insuperable difficulty. My influence, which is not	316:457, 4C  !
4C	small, shall all go that way; and, when once married,	316:457, 5C  !
4C	and properly supported by her own family, people of	316:457, 6C  !
4C	respectability as they are, she may recover her footing in	316:457, 7C  !
4C	society to a certain degree. In some circles, we know, she	316:457, 8C  !
4C	would never be admitted, but with good dinners, and large	316:457, 9C  !
4C	parties, there will always be those who will be glad of her	316:457,10C  !
4C	acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more liberality	316:457,11C  !
4C	and candour on those points than formerly. What I	316:457,12C  !
4C	advise is, that your father be quiet. Do not let him	316:457,13C  !
4C	injure his own cause by interference. Persuade him to	316:457,14C  !
4C	let things take their course. If by any officious exertions	316:457,15C  !
4C	of his, she is induced to leave Henry's protection, there	316:457,16C  !
4C	will be much less chance of his marrying her, than if she	316:457,17C  !
4C	remain with him. I know how he is likely to be influenced.	316:457,18C  !
4C	Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion, and	316:457,19C  !
4C	it may all end well; but if he get his daughter away, it will	316:457,20C  !
4C	be destroying the chief hold."	316:457,21C  !
4B	"Now, Fanny,"	316:457,26B  !
4B	"I shall soon have done.	316:457,26B  !
4B	I have told you the substance of all that she said. As	316:457,27B  !
4B	soon as I could speak, I replied that I had not supposed	316:457,28B  !
4B	it possible, coming in such a state of mind into that house,	316:457,29B  !
4B	as I had done, that any thing could occur to make me	316:457,30B  !
4B	suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds	316:457,31B  !
4B	in almost every sentence. That, though I had, in the	316:457,32B  !
4B	course of our acquaintance, been often sensible of some	316:457,33B  !
4B	difference in our opinions, on points too, of some moment,	316:457,34B  !
4B	it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference	316:457,35B  !
4B	could be such as she had now proved it. That the	316:457,36B  !
4B	manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed	316:457,37B  !
4B	by her brother and my sister ~ (with whom lay the greater	316:457,38B  !
4B	seduction I pretended not to say) ~ but the manner in	316:458, 1B  !
4B	which she spoke of the crime itself, giving it every reproach	316:458, 2B  !
4B	but the right, considering its ill consequences only as they	316:458, 3B  !
4B	were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency	316:458, 4B  !
4B	and impudence in wrong; and, last of all, and above all,	316:458, 5B  !
4B	recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an	316:458, 6B  !
4B	acquiescence, in the continuance of the sin, on the chance	316:458, 7B  !
4B	of a marriage which, thinking as I now thought of her	316:458, 8B  !
4B	brother, should rather be prevented than sought ~ all this	316:458, 9B  !
4B	together most grievously convinced me that I had never	316:458,10B  !
4B	understood her before, and that, as far as related to mind,	316:458,11B  !
4B	it had been the creature of my own imagination, not	316:458,12B  !
4B	Miss Crawford,	316:458,12B  !
4B	that I had been too apt to dwell on for many	316:458,13B  !
4B	months past. That, perhaps it was best for me; I had	316:458,14B  !
4B	less to regret in sacrificing a friendship ~ feelings ~ hopes	316:458,15B  !
4B	which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now.	316:458,16B  !
4B	And yet, that I must and would confess, that, could I have	316:458,17B  !
4B	restored her to what she had appeared to me before, I	316:458,18B  !
4B	would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting,	316:458,19B  !
4B	for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness	316:458,20B  !
4B	and esteem. This is what I said ~ the purport of it ~ but,	316:458,21B  !
4B	as you may imagine, not spoken so collectedly or methodically	316:458,22B  !
4B	as I have repeated it to you. She was astonished,	316:458,23B  !
4B	exceedingly astonished ~ more than astonished. I saw	316:458,24B  !
4B	her change countenance. She turned extremely red. I	316:458,25B  !
4B	imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings ~ a great,	316:458,26B  !
4B	though short struggle ~ half a wish of yielding to truths,	316:458,27B  !
4B	half a sense of shame ~ but habit, habit carried it. She	316:458,28B  !
4B	would have laughed if she could. It was a sort of laugh,	316:458,29B  !
4B	as she answered,	316:458,30B  !
4C	""A pretty good lecture upon my word.	316:458,30C  !
4C	Was it part of your last sermon? At this rate, you will	316:458,31C  !
4C	soon reform every body at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey;	316:458,32C  !
4C	and when I hear of you next, it may be as a celebrated	316:458,33C  !
4C	preacher in some great society of Methodists, or as a missionary	316:458,34C  !
4C	into foreign parts.""	316:458,35C  !
4B	She tried to speak carelessly;	316:458,35B  !
4B	but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear. I	316:458,36B  !
4B	only said in reply, that from my heart I wished her well,	316:458,37B  !
4B	and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think	316:458,38B  !
4B	more justly, and not owe the most valuable knowledge	316:459, 1B  !
4B	we could any of us acquire ~ the knowledge of ourselves	316:459, 2B  !
4B	and of our duty, to the lessons of affliction ~ and immediately	316:459, 3B  !
4B	left the room. I had gone a few steps, Fanny,	316:459, 4B  !
4B	when I heard the door open behind me.	316:459, 5B  !
4C	""Mr% Bertram,""	316:459, 5C  !
4B	said she. I looked back.	316:459, 6B  !
4C	""Mr% Bertram,""	316:459, 6C  !
4B	said she, with	316:459, 6B  !
4B	a smile ~ but it was a smile ill-suited to the conversation	316:459, 7B  !
4B	that had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite,	316:459, 8B  !
4B	in order to subdue me; at least, it appeared so to me.	316:459, 9B  !
4B	I resisted; it was the impulse of the moment to resist,	316:459,10B  !
4B	and still walked on. I have since ~ sometimes ~ for a	316:459,11B  !
4B	moment ~ regretted that I did not go back; but I know	316:459,12B  !
4B	I was right; and such has been the end of our acquaintance|	316:459,13B  !
4B	And what an acquaintance has it been| How	316:459,14B  !
4B	have I been deceived| Equally in brother and sister	316:459,15B  !
4B	deceived| I thank you for your patience, Fanny. This	316:459,16B  !
4B	has been the greatest relief, and now we will have done."	316:459,17B  !
5P	"Poor Miss Taylor| ~ I wish she were here again. What	101:  8,13P  !
5P	a pity it is that Mr% Weston ever thought of her|"	101:  8,14P  !
5A	"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.	101:  8,15A  !
5A	Mr% Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent	101:  8,16A  !
5A	man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife; ~ and you	101:  8,17A  !
5A	would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever and	101:  8,18A  !
5A	bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house	101:  8,19A  !
5A	of her own?"	101:  8,20A  !
5P	"A house of her own| ~ but where is the advantage of	101:  8,21P  !
5P	a house of her own? This is three times as large.~ And	101:  8,22P  !
5P	you have never any odd humours, my dear."	101:  8,23P  !
5A	"How often we shall be going to see them and they	101:  8,24A  !
5A	coming to see us|~ We shall be always meeting| \We\	101:  8,25A  !
5A	must begin, we must go and pay our wedding-visit very	101:  8,26A  !
5A	soon."	101:  8,27A  !
5P	"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such	101:  8,28P  !
5P	a distance. I could not walk half so far."	101:  8,29P  !
5A	"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We	101:  8,30A  !
5A	must go in the carriage to be sure."	101:  8,31A  !
5P	"The carriage| But James will not like to put the	101:  8,32P  !
5P	horses to for such a little way;~ and where are the poor	101:  8,33P  !
5P	horses to be while we are paying our visit?"	101:  8,34P  !
5A	"They are to be put into Mr% Weston's stable, papa.	101:  8,35A  !
5A	You know we have settled all that already. We talked	101:  8,36A  !
5A	it all over with Mr% Weston last night. And as for James,	101:  8,37A  !
5A	you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls,	101:  8,38A  !
5A	because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only	101:  9, 1A  !
5A	doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That,	101:  9, 2A  !
5A	was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place.	101:  9, 3A  !
5A	Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her ~	101:  9, 4A  !
5A	James is so obliged to you|"	101:  9, 5A  !
5P	"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky,	101:  9, 6P  !
5P	for I would not have had poor James think himself	101:  9, 7P  !
5P	slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make	101:  9, 8P  !
5P	a very good servant; she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl;	101:  9, 9P  !
5P	I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she	101:  9,10P  !
5P	always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty	101:  9,11P  !
5P	manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework,	101:  9,12P  !
5P	I observe she always turns the lock of the door the	101:  9,13P  !
5P	right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an	101:  9,14P  !
5P	excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor	101:  9,15P  !
5P	Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used	101:  9,16P  !
5P	to see. Whenever James goes over to see his daughter	101:  9,17P  !
5P	you know, she will be hearing of us. He will be able to	101:  9,18P  !
5P	tell her how we all are."	101:  9,19P  !
5P	"poor Isabella"	101:  9,38P  !
5P	"It is very kind of you, Mr% Knightley, to come out at	101: 10, 3P  !
5P	this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have	101: 10, 4P  !
5P	had a shocking walk."	101: 10, 5P  !
5B	"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful, moonlight night;	101: 10, 6B  !
5B	and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."	101: 10, 7B  !
5P	"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.	101: 10, 8P  !
5P	I wish you may not catch cold."	101: 10, 9P  !
5B	"Dirty, sir| Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."	101: 10,10B  !
5P	"Well| that is quite surprizing, for we have had a vast	101: 10,11P  !
5P	deal of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an	101: 10,12P  !
5P	hour, while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put	101: 10,13P  !
5P	off the wedding."	101: 10,14P  !
5B	"By the bye ~ I have not wished you joy. Being pretty	101: 10,15B  !
5B	well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling,	101: 10,16B  !
5B	I have been in no hurry with my congratulations. But	101: 10,17B  !
5B	I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all	101: 10,18B  !
5B	behave? Who cried most?"	101: 10,19B  !
5P	"Ah| poor Miss Taylor| 'tis a sad business."	101: 10,20P  !
5B	"Poor Mr% and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but	101: 10,21B  !
5B	I cannot possibly say ""poor Miss Taylor."" I have a great	101: 10,22B  !
5B	regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the	101: 10,23B  !
5B	question of dependence or independence|~ At any rate,	101: 10,24B  !
5B	it must be better to have only one to please, than two."	101: 10,25B  !
5A	"Especially when \one\ of those two is such a fanciful,	101: 10,26A  !
5A	troublesome creature|"	101: 10,27A  !
5A	"That,	101: 10,27A  !
5A	is what you have in your head, I know ~ and what you	101: 10,28A  !
5A	would certainly say if my father were not by."	101: 10,29A  !
5P	"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,"	101: 10,30P  !
5P	"I am afraid I am sometimes	101: 10,31P  !
5P	very fanciful and troublesome."	101: 10,32P  !
5A	"My dearest papa| You do not think I could mean	101: 10,33A  !
5A	\you\, or suppose Mr% Knightley to mean \you\. What	101: 10,34A  !
5A	a horrible idea| Oh, no| I meant only myself. Mr% Knightley	101: 10,35A  !
5A	loves to find fault with me you know ~ in a	101: 10,36A  !
5A	joke ~ it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one	101: 10,37A  !
5A	another."	101: 10,38A  !
5B	"Emma knows I never flatter her,"	101: 11, 8B  !
5B	"but I meant no reflection on any body. Miss Taylor	101: 11, 9B  !
5B	has been used to have two persons to please; she will	101: 11,10B  !
5B	now have but one. The chances are that she must be	101: 11,11B  !
5B	a gainer."	101: 11,12B  !
5A	"Well,"	101: 11,13A  !
5A	"you want	101: 11,13A  !
5A	to hear about the wedding, and I shall be happy to tell	101: 11,14A  !
5A	you, for we all behaved charmingly. Every body was	101: 11,15A  !
5A	punctual, every body in their best looks. Not a tear, and	101: 11,16A  !
5A	hardly a long face to be seen. Oh| no, we all felt that	101: 11,17A  !
5A	we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure	101: 11,18A  !
5A	of meeting every day."	101: 11,19A  !
5P	"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,"	101: 11,20P  !
5P	"But, Mr% Knightley, she is really very sorry to	101: 11,21P  !
5P	lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she \will\ miss her	101: 11,22P  !
5P	more than she thinks for."	101: 11,23P  !
5B	"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such	101: 11,26B  !
5B	a companion,"	101: 11,27B  !
5B	"We should not like	101: 11,27B  !
5B	her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it. But she	101: 11,28B  !
5B	knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage;	101: 11,29B  !
5B	she knows how very acceptable it must be at Miss Taylor's	101: 11,30B  !
5B	time of life to be settled in a home of her own,	101: 11,31B  !
5B	and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable	101: 11,32B  !
5B	provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so	101: 11,33B  !
5B	much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must	101: 11,34B  !
5B	be glad to have her so happily married."	101: 11,35B  !
5A	"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,"	101: 11,36A  !
5A	"and a very considerable one ~ that I made	101: 11,37A  !
5A	the match myself. I made the match, you know, four	101: 11,38A  !
5A	years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in	101: 12, 1A  !
5A	the right, when so many people said Mr% Weston would	101: 12, 2A  !
5A	never marry again, may comfort me for any thing."	101: 12, 3A  !
5P	"Ah| my dear, I wish you would not make	101: 12, 5P  !
5P	matches and foretel things, for whatever you say always	101: 12, 6P  !
5P	comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches."	101: 12, 7P  !
5A	"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but	101: 12, 8A  !
5A	I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement	101: 12, 9A  !
5A	in the world| And after such success you know|~	101: 12,10A  !
5A	Every body said that Mr% Weston would never marry	101: 12,11A  !
5A	again. Oh dear, no| Mr% Weston, who had been a	101: 12,12A  !
5A	widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable	101: 12,13A  !
5A	without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his	101: 12,14A  !
5A	business in town or among his friends here, always	101: 12,15A  !
5A	acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful ~ Mr% Weston	101: 12,16A  !
5A	need not spend a single evening in the year alone if	101: 12,17A  !
5A	he did not like it. Oh, no| Mr% Weston certainly would	101: 12,18A  !
5A	never marry again. Some people even talked of a promise	101: 12,19A  !
5A	to his wife on her death-bed, and others of the son and the	101: 12,20A  !
5A	uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense	101: 12,21A  !
5A	was talked on the subject, but I believed none of it. Ever	101: 12,22A  !
5A	since the day (about four years ago) that Miss Taylor and	101: 12,23A  !
5A	I met with him in Broadway-lane, when, because it began	101: 12,24A  !
5A	to mizzle, he darted away with so much gallantry, and	101: 12,25A  !
5A	borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's,	101: 12,26A  !
5A	I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match	101: 12,27A  !
5A	from that hour; and when such success has blessed me	101: 12,28A  !
5A	in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall	101: 12,29A  !
5A	leave off match-making."	101: 12,30A  !
5B	"I do not understand what you mean by ""success;"""	101: 12,31B  !
5B	"Success supposes endeavour. Your	101: 12,32B  !
5B	time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have	101: 12,33B  !
5B	been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about	101: 12,34B  !
5B	this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's	101: 12,35B  !
5B	mind| But if, which I rather imagine, your making the	101: 12,36B  !
5B	match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your	101: 12,37B  !
5B	saying to yourself one idle day, ""I think it would be	101: 12,38B  !
5B	a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr% Weston were to	101: 13, 1B  !
5B	marry her,"" and saying it again to yourself every now and	101: 13, 2B  !
5B	then afterwards,~ why do you talk of success? where is	101: 13, 3B  !
5B	your merit?~ what are you proud of?~ you made a lucky	101: 13, 4B  !
5B	guess; and \that\ is all that can be said."	101: 13, 5B  !
5A	"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph	101: 13, 6A  !
5A	of a lucky guess?~ I pity you.~ I thought you cleverer~	101: 13, 7A  !
5A	for depend upon it, a lucky guess is never merely luck.	101: 13, 8A  !
5A	There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor	101: 13, 9A  !
5A	word ""success,"" which you quarrel with, I do not know	101: 13,10A  !
5A	that I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have	101: 13,11A  !
5A	drawn two pretty pictures ~ but I think there may be	101: 13,12A  !
5A	a third ~ a something between the do-nothing and the	101: 13,13A  !
5A	do-all. If I had not promoted Mr% Weston's visits here,	101: 13,14A  !
5A	and given many little encouragements, and smoothed	101: 13,15A  !
5A	many little matters, it might not have come to any thing	101: 13,16A  !
5A	after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to	101: 13,17A  !

5B	"A straight-forward, open-hearted man, like Weston,	101: 13,19B  !
5B	and a rational unaffected woman, like Miss Taylor, may be	101: 13,20B  !
5B	safely left to manage their own concerns. You are more	101: 13,21B  !
5B	likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them,	101: 13,22B  !

5A	and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would	101: 13,33A  !

5A	when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very	101: 13,35A  !

5M	three miles round one day, in order to bring her some	104: 28,17M  !
5M	walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them~	104: 28,18M  !

5M	his shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose	104: 28,20M  !
5M	to sing to her. She was very fond of singing. He could	104: 28,21M  !
5M	sing a little himself. She believed he was very clever,	104: 28,22M  !
5M	and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock;	104: 28,23M  !

5M	his wool than any body in the country. She believed	104: 28,25M  !
5M	every body spoke well of him. His mother and sisters	104: 28,26M  !

5M	he has read a good deal ~ but not what you would think	104: 29, 6M  !
5M	any thing of. He reads the Agricultural Reports and some	104: 29, 7M  !

5M	him very plain at first, but I do not think him so plain	104: 29,20M  !
5M	now. One does not, you know, after a time. But, did you	104: 29,21M  !
5M	never see him| He is in Highbury every now and then,	104: 29,22M  !

5A	"That may be ~ and I may have seen him fifty times,	104: 29,25A  !

5A	farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the very last	104: 29,27A  !
5A	sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are	104: 29,28A  !
5A	precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have	104: 29,29A  !
5A	nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable	104: 29,30A  !
5A	appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful	104: 29,31A  !
5A	to their families in some way or other. But a farmer can	104: 29,32A  !
5A	need none of my help, and is therefore in one sense as	104: 29,33A  !
5A	much above my notice as in every other he is below it."	104: 29,34A  !

5A	His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They	104: 30, 7A  !
5A	seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were to	104: 30, 8A  !
5A	take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent	104: 30, 9A  !
5A	it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort	104: 30,10A  !
5A	of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little	104: 30,11A  !
5A	money, it might be very desirable."	104: 30,12A  !
5M	"Six years hence| dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be	104: 30,13M  !
5M	thirty years old|"	104: 30,14M  !
5A	"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to	104: 30,15A  !
5A	marry, who are not born to an independence. Mr% Martin,	104: 30,16A  !
5A	I imagine, has his fortune entirely to make ~ cannot be	104: 30,17A  !
5A	at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he	104: 30,18A  !
5A	might come into when his father died, whatever his share	104: 30,19A  !
5A	of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all	104: 30,20A  !
5A	employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with	104: 30,21A  !
5A	diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next	104: 30,22A  !
5A	to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet."	104: 30,23A  !
5M	"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably.	104: 30,24M  !
5M	They have no in-doors man ~ else they do not want for	104: 30,25M  !
5M	any thing; and Mrs% Martin talks of taking a boy another	104: 30,26M  !
5M	year."	104: 30,27M  !
5A	"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever	104: 30,28A  !
5A	he does marry;~ I mean, as to being acquainted	104: 30,29A  !
5A	with his wife ~ for though his sisters, from a superior	104: 30,30A  !
5A	education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does	104: 30,31A  !
5A	not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you	104: 30,32A  !
5A	to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make	104: 30,33A  !
5A	you particularly careful as to your associates. There can	104: 30,34A  !
5A	be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, and	104: 30,35A  !
5A	you must support your claim to that station by every thing	104: 30,36A  !
5A	within your own power, or there will be plenty of	104: 30,37A  !
5A	people who would take pleasure in degrading you."	104: 30,38A  !
5M	"Yes, to be sure ~ I suppose there are. But while	104: 31, 1M  !
5M	I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,	104: 31, 2M  !
5M	I am not afraid of what any body can do."	104: 31, 3M  !
5A	"You understand the force of influence pretty well,	104: 31, 4A  !
5A	Harriet; but I would have you so firmly established in	104: 31, 5A  !
5A	good society, as to be independent even of Hartfield and	104: 31, 6A  !
5A	Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently well	104: 31, 7A  !
5A	connected ~ and to that end it will be advisable to have	104: 31, 8A  !
5A	as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say	104: 31, 9A  !
5A	that if you should still be in this country when Mr% Martin	104: 31,10A  !
5A	marries, I wish you may not be drawn in, by your intimacy	104: 31,11A  !
5A	with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will	104: 31,12A  !
5A	probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without	104: 31,13A  !
5A	education."	104: 31,14A  !
5M	"To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr% Martin would	104: 31,15M  !
5M	ever marry any body but what had had some education ~	104: 31,16M  !
5M	and been very well brought up. However, I do not mean	104: 31,17M  !
5M	to set up my opinion against your's ~ and I am sure I shall	104: 31,18M  !
5M	not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always	104: 31,19M  !
5M	have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially	104: 31,20M  !
5M	Elizabeth, and should be very sorry to give them up, for	104: 31,21M  !
5M	they are quite as well educated as me. But if he marries	104: 31,22M  !
5M	a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not	104: 31,23M  !
5M	visit her, if I can help it."	104: 31,24M  !
5M	"Only think of our happening to meet him|~ How	104: 32,13M  !
5M	very odd| It was quite a chance, he said, that he had	104: 32,14M  !
5M	not gone round by Randalls. He did not think we ever	104: 32,15M  !
5M	walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls	104: 32,16M  !
5M	most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest	104: 32,17M  !
5M	yet. He was so busy the last time he was	104: 32,18M  !
5M	at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again	104: 32,19M  !
5M	to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet|	104: 32,20M  !
5M	Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected?	104: 32,21M  !
5M	What do you think of him? Do you think him so very	104: 32,22M  !
5M	plain?"	104: 32,23M  !
5A	"He is very plain, undoubtedly ~ remarkably plain:~	104: 32,24A  !
5A	but that is nothing, compared with his entire want of	104: 32,25A  !
5A	gentility. I had no right to expect much, and I did not	104: 32,26A  !
5A	expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so very	104: 32,27A  !
5A	clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him,	104: 32,28A  !
5A	I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility."	104: 32,29A  !
5M	"To be sure,"	104: 32,30M  !
5M	"he is	104: 32,30M  !
5M	not so genteel as real gentlemen."	104: 32,31M  !
5A	"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us,	104: 32,32A  !
5A	you have been repeatedly in the company of some, such	104: 32,33A  !
5A	very real gentlemen, that you must yourself be struck	104: 32,34A  !
5A	with the difference in Mr% Martin. At Hartfield you have	104: 32,35A  !
5A	had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men.	104: 32,36A  !
5A	I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be	104: 32,37A  !
5A	in company with Mr% Martin again without perceiving	104: 32,38A  !
5A	him to be a very inferior creature ~ and rather wondering	104: 33, 1A  !
5A	at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable	104: 33, 2A  !
5A	before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not	104: 33, 3A  !
5A	you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by	104: 33, 4A  !
5A	his awkward look and abrupt manner ~ and the uncouthness	104: 33, 5A  !
5A	of a voice, which I heard to be wholly unmodulated	104: 33, 6A  !
5A	as I stood here."	104: 33, 7A  !
5M	"Certainly, he is not like Mr% Knightley. He has not	104: 33, 8M  !
5M	such a fine air and way of walking as Mr% Knightley.	104: 33, 9M  !
5M	I see the difference plain enough. But Mr% Knightley is	104: 33,10M  !
5M	so very fine a man|"	104: 33,11M  !
5A	"Mr% Knightley's air is so remarkably good, that it is	104: 33,12A  !
5A	not fair to compare Mr% Martin with \him\. You might	104: 33,13A  !
5A	not see one in a hundred, with \gentleman\ so plainly written	104: 33,14A  !
5A	as in Mr% Knightley. But he is not the only gentleman	104: 33,15A  !
5A	you have been lately used to. What say you to	104: 33,16A  !
5A	Mr% Weston and Mr% Elton? Compare Mr% Martin with	104: 33,17A  !
5A	either of \them\. Compare their manner of carrying themselves;	104: 33,18A  !
5A	of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You	104: 33,19A  !
5A	must see the difference."	104: 33,20A  !
5M	"Oh, yes| ~ there is a great difference. But Mr% Weston	104: 33,21M  !
5M	is almost an old man. Mr% Weston must be between forty	104: 33,22M  !
5M	and fifty."	104: 33,23M  !
5A	"Which makes his good manners the more valuable.	104: 33,24A  !
5A	The older a person grows, Harriet, the more important it	104: 33,25A  !
5A	is that their manners should not be bad ~ the more glaring	104: 33,26A  !
5A	and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness	104: 33,27A  !
5A	becomes. What is passable in youth, is detestable	104: 33,28A  !
5A	in later age. Mr% Martin is now awkward and abrupt;	104: 33,29A  !
5A	what will he be at Mr% Weston's time of life?"	104: 33,30A  !
5M	"There is no saying, indeed|"	104: 33,31M  !
5A	"But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be	104: 33,33A  !
5A	a completely gross, vulgar farmer ~ totally inattentive to	104: 33,34A  !
5A	appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss."	104: 33,35A  !
5M	"Will he, indeed, that will be very bad."	104: 33,36M  !
5A	"How much his business engrosses him already, is very	104: 33,37A  !
5A	plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire	104: 33,38A  !
5A	for the book you recommended. He was a great deal too	104: 34, 1A  !
5A	full of the market to think of any thing else ~ which is	104: 34, 2A  !
5A	just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to	104: 34, 3A  !
5A	do with books? And I have no doubt that he \will\ thrive	104: 34, 4A  !
5A	and be a very rich man in time ~ and his being illiterate	104: 34, 5A  !
5A	and coarse need not disturb \us\."	104: 34, 6A  !
5M	"I wonder he did not remember the book"~	104: 34, 7M  !
5A	"In one respect, perhaps, Mr% Elton's manners are	104: 34,12A  !
5A	superior to Mr% Knightley's or Mr% Weston's. They have	104: 34,13A  !
5A	more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as	104: 34,14A  !
5A	a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost	104: 34,15A  !
5A	a bluntness in Mr% Weston, which every body likes in \him\	104: 34,16A  !
5A	because there is so much good humour with it ~ but that	104: 34,17A  !
5A	would not do to be copied. Neither would Mr% Knightley's	104: 34,18A  !
5A	downright, decided, commanding sort of manner ~ though	104: 34,19A  !
5A	it suits \him\ very well; his figure and look, and situation	104: 34,20A  !
5A	in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to	104: 34,21A  !
5A	set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the	104: 34,22A  !
5A	contrary, I think a young man might be very safely	104: 34,23A  !
5A	recommended to take Mr% Elton as a model. Mr% Elton	104: 34,24A  !
5A	is good humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He	104: 34,25A  !
5A	seems to me, to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do	104: 34,26A  !
5A	not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself	104: 34,27A  !
5A	with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but	104: 34,28A  !
5A	it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used	104: 34,29A  !
5A	to be. If he means anything, it must be to please you.	104: 34,30A  !
5A	Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?"	104: 34,31A  !
5B	"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs% Weston,"	105: 36, 1B  !
5B	"of this great intimacy between	105: 36, 2B  !
5B	Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing."	105: 36, 3B  !
5O	"A bad thing| Do you really think it a bad thing?~	105: 36, 4O  !
5O	why so?"	105: 36, 5O  !
5B	"I think they will neither of them do the other any	105: 36, 6B  !
5B	good."	105: 36, 7B  !
5O	"You surprize me| Emma must do Harriet good:	105: 36, 8O  !
5O	and by supplying her with a new object of interest, Harriet	105: 36, 9O  !
5O	may be said to do Emma good. I have been seeing their	105: 36,10O  !
5O	intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently	105: 36,11O  !
5O	we feel|~ Not think they will do each other any good|	105: 36,12O  !
5O	This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels	105: 36,13O  !
5O	about Emma, Mr% Knightley."	105: 36,14O  !
5B	"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel	105: 36,15B  !
5B	with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you must	105: 36,16B  !
5B	still fight your own battle."	105: 36,17B  !
5O	"Mr% Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were	105: 36,18O  !
5O	here, for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject. We	105: 36,19O  !
5O	were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how	105: 36,20O  !
5O	fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such	105: 36,21O  !
5O	a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr% Knightley,	105: 36,22O  !
5O	I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.	105: 36,23O  !
5O	You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know	105: 36,24O  !
5O	the value of a companion; and perhaps no man can be	105: 36,25O  !
5O	a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society	105: 36,26O  !
5O	of one of her own sex, after being used to it all her life.	105: 36,27O  !
5O	I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is	105: 36,28O  !
5O	not the superior young woman which Emma's friend	105: 36,29O  !
5O	ought to be. But on the other hand as Emma wants to	105: 36,30O  !
5O	see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her	105: 36,31O  !
5O	to read more herself. They will read together. She	105: 36,32O  !
5O	means it, I know."	105: 36,33O  !
5B	"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she	105: 37, 1B  !
5B	was twelve years old. I have seen a great many lists of	105: 37, 2B  !
5B	her drawing up at various times of books that she meant	105: 37, 3B  !
5B	to read regularly through ~ and very good lists they were ~	105: 37, 4B  !
5B	very well chosen, and very neatly arranged ~ sometimes	105: 37, 5B  !
5B	alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The	105: 37, 6B  !
5B	list she drew up when only fourteen ~ I remember thinking	105: 37, 7B  !
5B	it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it	105: 37, 8B  !
5B	some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very	105: 37, 9B  !
5B	good list now. But I have done with expecting any	105: 37,10B  !
5B	course of steady reading from Emma. She will never	105: 37,11B  !
5B	submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and	105: 37,12B  !
5B	a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. Where	105: 37,13B  !
5B	Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that	105: 37,14B  !
5B	Harriet Smith will do nothing.~ You never could persuade	105: 37,15B  !
5B	her to read half so much as you wished.~ You know you	105: 37,16B  !
5B	could not."	105: 37,17B  !
5O	"I dare say,"	105: 37,18O  !
5O	"that	105: 37,18O  !
5O	I thought so \then\;~ but since we have parted, I can	105: 37,19O  !
5O	never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I	105: 37,20O  !
5O	wished."	105: 37,21O  !
5B	"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory	105: 37,22B  !
5B	as \that\" ~	105: 37,23B  !
5B	"But I",	105: 37,24B  !
5B	"who have	105: 37,24B  !
5B	had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still see,	105: 37,25B  !
5B	hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the	105: 37,26B  !
5B	cleverest of her family. At ten years old, she had the	105: 37,27B  !
5B	misfortune of being able to answer questions which	105: 37,28B  !
5B	puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always quick	105: 37,29B  !
5B	and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since	105: 37,30B  !
5B	she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house	105: 37,31B  !
5B	and of you all. In her mother she lost the only person	105: 37,32B  !
5B	able to cope with her. She inherits her mother's talents,	105: 37,33B  !
5B	and must have been under subjection to her."	105: 37,34B  !
5O	"I should have been sorry, Mr% Knightley, to be	105: 37,35O  !
5O	dependent on \your\ recommendation, had I quitted	105: 37,36O  !
5O	Mr% Woodhouse's family and wanted another situation;	105: 37,37O  !
5O	I do not think you would have spoken a good word for	105: 37,38O  !
5O	me to any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit	105: 38, 1O  !
5O	for the office I held."	105: 38, 2O  !
5B	"Yes,"	105: 38, 3B  !
5B	"You are better placed \here\;	105: 38, 3B  !
5B	very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But	105: 38, 4B  !
5B	you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all	105: 38, 5B  !
5B	the time you were at Hartfield. You might not give	105: 38, 6B  !
5B	Emma such a complete education as your powers would	105: 38, 7B  !
5B	seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good	105: 38, 8B  !
5B	education from \her\, on the very material matrimonial point	105: 38, 9B  !
5B	of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid;	105: 38,10B  !
5B	and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife,	105: 38,11B  !
5B	I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."	105: 38,12B  !
5O	"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making	105: 38,13O  !
5O	a good wife to such a man as Mr% Weston."	105: 38,14O  !
5B	"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather	105: 38,15B  !
5B	thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear,	105: 38,16B  !
5B	there will be nothing to be borne. We will not despair,	105: 38,17B  !
5B	however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness	105: 38,18B  !
5B	of comfort, or his son may plague him."	105: 38,19B  !
5O	"I hope not \that\.~ It is not likely. No, Mr% Knightley,	105: 38,20O  !
5O	do not foretel vexation from that quarter."	105: 38,21O  !
5B	"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not	105: 38,22B  !
5B	pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing.	105: 38,23B  !
5B	I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston	105: 38,24B  !
5B	in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.~ But Harriet Smith~	105: 38,25B  !
5B	I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her	105: 38,26B  !
5B	the very worst sort of companion that Emma could	105: 38,27B  !
5B	possibly have. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon	105: 38,28B  !
5B	Emma as knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all	105: 38,29B  !
5B	her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.	105: 38,30B  !
5B	Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma	105: 38,31B  !
5B	imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet	105: 38,32B  !
5B	is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for	105: 38,33B  !
5B	Harriet, I will venture to say that \she\ cannot gain by the	105: 38,34B  !
5B	acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit	105: 38,35B  !
5B	with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow	105: 38,36B  !
5B	just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among	105: 38,37B  !
5B	whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.	105: 38,38B  !
5B	I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any	105: 39, 1B  !
5B	strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt	105: 39, 2B  !
5B	herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.~	105: 39, 3B  !
5B	They only give a little polish."	105: 39, 4B  !
5O	"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than	105: 39, 5O  !
5O	you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for	105: 39, 6O  !
5O	I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well she looked	105: 39, 7O  !
5O	last night|"	105: 39, 8O  !
5B	"Oh| you would rather talk of her person than her	105: 39, 9B  !
5B	mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to	105: 39,10B  !
5B	deny Emma's being pretty."	105: 39,11B  !
5O	"Pretty| say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing	105: 39,12O  !
5O	nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether ~ face	105: 39,13O  !
5O	and figure?"	105: 39,14O  !
5B	"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess	105: 39,15B  !
5B	that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to	105: 39,16B  !
5B	me than her's. But I am a partial old friend."	105: 39,17B  !
5O	"Such an eye|~ the true hazle eye ~ and so brilliant|	105: 39,18O  !
5O	regular features, open countenance, with a complexion|	105: 39,19O  !
5O	oh| what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height	105: 39,20O  !
5O	and size; such a firm and upright figure. There is health,	105: 39,21O  !
5O	not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her	105: 39,22O  !
5O	glance. One hears sometimes of a child being ""the picture	105: 39,23O  !
5O	of health;"" now Emma always gives me the idea of being	105: 39,24O  !
5O	the complete picture of grown-up health. She is loveliness	105: 39,25O  !
5O	itself. Mr% Knightley, is not she?"	105: 39,26O  !
5B	"I have not a fault to find with her person,"	105: 39,27B  !
5B	I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and	105: 39,28B  !
5B	I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally	105: 39,29B  !
5B	vain. Considering how very handsome she is, she appears	105: 39,30B  !
5B	to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.	105: 39,31B  !
5B	Mrs% Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of	105: 39,32B  !
5B	her intimacy with Harriet Smith, or my dread of its	105: 39,33B  !
5B	doing them both harm."	105: 39,34B  !
5O	"And I, Mr% Knightley, am equally stout in my	105: 39,35O  !
5O	confidence of its not doing them any harm. With all dear	105: 39,36O  !
5O	Emma's little faults, she is an excellent creature. Where	105: 39,37O  !
5O	shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer	105: 39,38O  !
5O	friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be trusted;	105: 40, 1O  !
5O	she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make	105: 40, 2O  !
5O	no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the	105: 40, 3O  !
5O	right a hundred times."	105: 40, 4O  !
5B	"Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma	105: 40, 5B  !
5B	shall be an angel, and I will keep my spleen to myself till	105: 40, 6B  !
5B	Christmas brings John and Isabella. John loves Emma	105: 40, 7B  !
5B	with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and	105: 40, 8B  !
5B	Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not	105: 40, 9B  !
5B	quite frightened enough about the children. I am sure	105: 40,10B  !
5B	of having their opinions with me."	105: 40,11B  !
5O	"I know that you all love her really too well to be	105: 40,12O  !
5O	unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Mr% Knightley, if	105: 40,13O  !
5O	I take the liberty (I consider myself, you know, as having	105: 40,14O  !
5O	somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's mother	105: 40,15O  !
5O	might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think	105: 40,16O  !
5O	any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy	105: 40,17O  !
5O	being made a matter of much discussion among you.	105: 40,18O  !
5O	Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience	105: 40,19O  !
5O	may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be	105: 40,20O  !
5O	expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her	105: 40,21O  !
5O	father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should	105: 40,22O  !
5O	put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to	105: 40,23O  !
5O	herself. It has been so many years my province to give	105: 40,24O  !
5O	advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr% Knightley, at	105: 40,25O  !
5O	this little remains of office."	105: 40,26O  !
5B	"Not at all,"	105: 40,27B  !
5B	"I am much obliged to you for	105: 40,27B  !
5B	it. It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate	105: 40,28B  !
5B	than your advice has often found; for it shall be attended	105: 40,29B  !
5B	to."	105: 40,30B  !
5O	"Mrs% John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be	105: 40,31O  !
5O	made unhappy about her sister."	105: 40,32O  !
5B	"Be satisfied,"	105: 40,33B  !
5B	"I will not raise any outcry.	105: 40,33B  !
5B	I will keep my ill-humour to myself. I have a very	105: 40,34B  !
5B	sincere interest in Emma. Isabella does not seem more	105: 40,35B  !
5B	my sister; has never excited a greater interest; perhaps	105: 40,36B  !
5B	hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what	105: 40,37B  !
5B	one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her|"	105: 40,38B  !
5O	"So do I,"	105: 41, 1O  !
5O	"very much."	105: 41, 1O  !
5B	"She always declares she will never marry, which, of	105: 41, 2B  !
5B	course, means just nothing at all. But I have no idea	105: 41, 3B  !
5B	that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for. It would	105: 41, 4B  !
5B	not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with	105: 41, 5B  !
5B	a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and	105: 41, 6B  !
5B	in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. But	105: 41, 7B  !
5B	there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes	105: 41, 8B  !
5B	so seldom from home."	105: 41, 9B  !
5O	"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to	105: 41,10O  !
5O	break her resolution, at present,"	105: 41,11O  !
5O	"as	105: 41,11O  !
5O	can well be; and while she is so happy at Hartfield,	105: 41,12O  !
5O	I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which	105: 41,13O  !
5O	would be creating such difficulties, on poor Mr% Woodhouse's	105: 41,14O  !
5O	account. I do not recommend matrimony at	105: 41,15O  !
5O	present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state	105: 41,16O  !
5O	I assure you."	105: 41,17O  !
5B	"What does Weston	105: 41,23B  !
5B	think of the weather; shall we have rain?"	105: 41,24B  !
5A	"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but	106: 42,23A  !
5A	Harriet only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few,	106: 42,24A  !
5A	very few hints. She had all the natural grace of sweetness	106: 42,25A  !
5A	of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very	106: 42,26A  !
5A	little."	106: 42,27A  !
5A	"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of	106: 42,30A  !
5A	character, have taught her to think on points which had	106: 42,31A  !
5A	not fallen in her way before."	106: 42,32A  !
5A	"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met	106: 43, 3A  !
5A	with a disposition more truly amiable."	106: 43, 4A  !
5A	"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?"	106: 43,10A  !
5A	"Did you ever sit for your picture?"	106: 43,11A  !
5M	"Oh| dear, no, never."	106: 43,14M  !
5A	"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her	106: 43,16A  !
5A	would be| I would give any money for it. I almost long	106: 43,17A  !
5A	to attempt her likeness myself. You do not know it	106: 43,18A  !
5A	I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great	106: 43,19A  !
5A	passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my	106: 43,20A  !
5A	friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in	106: 43,21A  !
5A	general. But from one cause or another, I gave it up in	106: 43,22A  !
5A	disgust. But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet	106: 43,23A  !
5A	would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her	106: 43,24A  !
5A	picture|"	106: 43,25A  !
5A	"Well, if you give	106: 43,37A  !
5A	me such kind encouragement, Mr% Elton, I believe I shall	106: 43,38A  !
5A	try what I can do. Harriet's features are very delicate,	106: 44, 1A  !
5A	which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity	106: 44, 2A  !
5A	in the shape of the eye and the lines about the	106: 44, 3A  !
5A	mouth which one ought to catch."	106: 44, 4A  !
5A	"But I am afraid, Mr% Elton, Harriet will not like to	106: 44, 9A  !
5A	sit. She thinks so little of her own beauty. Did not you	106: 44,10A  !
5A	observe her manner of answering me? How completely	106: 44,11A  !
5A	it meant, ""why should my picture be drawn?""	106: 44,12A  !
5A	"No great variety of faces for you,"	106: 45, 7A  !
5A	"I	106: 45, 7A  !
5A	had only my own family to study from. There is my	106: 45, 8A  !
5A	father ~ another of my father ~ but the idea of sitting for	106: 45, 9A  !
5A	his picture made him so nervous, that I could only take	106: 45,10A  !
5A	him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore.	106: 45,11A  !
5A	Mrs% Weston again, and again, and again, you see. Dear	106: 45,12A  !
5A	Mrs% Weston| always my kindest friend on every occasion.	106: 45,13A  !
5A	She would sit whenever I asked her. There is my sister;	106: 45,14A  !
5A	and really quite her own little elegant figure|~ and the	106: 45,15A  !
5A	face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of	106: 45,16A  !
5A	her, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such	106: 45,17A  !
5A	a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would	106: 45,18A  !
5A	not be quiet. Then, here come all my attempts at three	106: 45,19A  !
5A	of those four children;~ there they are, Henry and John	106: 45,20A  !
5A	and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any	106: 45,21A  !
5A	one of them might do for any one of the rest. She was so	106: 45,22A  !
5A	eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but	106: 45,23A  !
5A	there is no making children of three or four years old stand	106: 45,24A  !
5A	still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any	106: 45,25A  !
5A	likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless	106: 45,26A  !
5A	they are coarser featured than any mama's children ever	106: 45,27A  !
5A	were. Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby.	106: 45,28A  !
5A	I took him, as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as	106: 45,29A  !
5A	strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.	106: 45,30A  !
5A	He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's	106: 45,31A  !
5A	very like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner	106: 45,32A  !
5A	of the sofa is very good. Then here is my last"~	106: 45,33A  !
5A	"my last and my best ~ my brother, Mr% John Knightley.	106: 45,35A  !
5A	~ This did not want much of being finished, when I put	106: 45,36A  !
5A	it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another	106: 45,37A  !
5A	likeness. I could not help being provoked; for after all	106: 45,38A  !
5A	my pains, and when I had really made a very good	106: 46, 1A  !
5A	likeness of it ~ (Mrs% Weston and I were quite agreed in	106: 46, 2A  !
5A	thinking it \very\ like)~ only too handsome ~ too flattering	106: 46, 3A  !
5A	~ but that was a fault on the right side ~ after all this,	106: 46, 4A  !
5A	came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of ~	106: 46, 5A  !
5A	We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to	106: 46, 7A  !
5A	sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and altogether	106: 46, 8A  !
5A	it was more than I could bear; and so I never would	106: 46, 9A  !
5A	finish it, to have it apologized over as an unfavourable	106: 46,10A  !
5A	likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick-square;~	106: 46,11A  !
5A	and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing anybody	106: 46,12A  !
5A	again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own, and	106: 46,13A  !
5A	as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present,	106: 46,14A  !
5A	I will break my resolution now."	106: 46,15A  !
5A	"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would	106: 46,37A  !
5A	be a kindness indeed| It would amuse away the difficulties	106: 46,38A  !

5O	expression of the eye is most correct, but Miss Smith has	106: 48, 1O  !
5O	not those eye-brows and eye-lashes. It is the fault of her	106: 48, 2O  !
5O	face that she has them not."	106: 48, 3O  !

5P	done| Just as your drawings always are, my dear. I do	106: 48,20P  !
5P	not know any body who draws so well as you do. The	106: 48,21P  !
5P	only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to	106: 48,22P  !
5P	be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her	106: 48,23P  !
5P	shoulders ~ and it makes one think she must catch cold."	106: 48,24P  !
5A	"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer;	106: 48,25A  !
5A	a warm day in summer. Look at the tree."	106: 48,26A  !

5A	I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if	107: 52,10A  !
5A	you feel in doubt as to the \purport\ of your answer. I had	107: 52,11A  !
5A	imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording	107: 52,12A  !
5A	of it."	107: 52,13A  !
5A	"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."	107: 52,16A  !
5M	"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean ~ What shall	107: 52,17M  !
5M	I do? What would you advise me to do? Pray, dear	107: 52,18M  !
5M	Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do?"	107: 52,19M  !
5A	"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have	107: 52,20A  !
5A	nothing to do with it. This is a point which you must	107: 52,21A  !
5A	settle with your own feelings."	107: 52,22A  !
5M	"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,"	107: 52,23M  !
5A	"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a	107: 52,28A  !
5A	woman \doubts\ as to whether she should accept a man or	107: 52,29A  !
5A	not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate	107: 52,30A  !
5A	as to ""Yes,"" she ought to say ""No"" directly. It is not a	107: 52,31A  !
5A	state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with	107: 52,32A  !
5A	half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older	107: 52,33A  !
5A	than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not	107: 52,34A  !
5A	imagine that I want to influence you."	107: 52,35A  !
5M	"Oh| no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to ~~	107: 52,36M  !
5M	but if you would just advise me what I had best do~ No,	107: 52,37M  !
5M	no, I do not mean that ~ As you say, one's mind ought to	107: 52,38M  !
5M	be quite made up~ One should not be hesitating~It is	107: 53, 1M  !
5M	a very serious thing.~ It will be safer to say ""No"",	107: 53, 2M  !
5M	perhaps.~ Do you think I had better say ""No?"" ".	107: 53, 3M  !
5A	"Not for the world,"	107: 53, 4A  !
5A	"would I advise you either way. You must be the best	107: 53, 5A  !
5A	judge of your own happiness. If you prefer Mr% Martin	107: 53, 6A  !
5A	to every other person; if you think him the most agreeable	107: 53, 7A  !
5A	man you have ever been in company with, why	107: 53, 8A  !
5A	should you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.~ Does any body	107: 53, 9A  !
5A	else occur to you at this moment under such a	107: 53,10A  !
5A	definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive yourself;	107: 53,11A  !
5A	do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.	107: 53,12A  !
5A	At this moment whom are you thinking of?"	107: 53,13A  !
5M	"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion,	107: 53,21M  !
5M	I must do as well as I can by myself; and I have now	107: 53,22M  !
5M	quite determined, and really almost made up my mind~	107: 53,23M  !
5M	to refuse Mr% Martin. Do you think I am right?"	107: 53,24M  !
5A	"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you	107: 53,25A  !
5A	are doing just what you ought. While you were at all in	107: 53,26A  !
5A	suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you	107: 53,27A  !
5A	are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving.	107: 53,28A  !
5A	Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would	107: 53,29A  !
5A	have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must	107: 53,30A  !
5A	have been the consequence of your marrying Mr% Martin.	107: 53,31A  !
5A	While you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said	107: 53,32A  !
5A	nothing about it, because I would not influence; but it	107: 53,33A  !
5A	would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not	107: 53,34A  !
5A	have visited Mrs% Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.	107: 53,35A  !
5A	Now I am secure of you for ever."	107: 53,36A  !
5M	"You could not have visited me|"	107: 54, 1M  !
5M	"No, to be sure you could not; but I never	107: 54, 2M  !
5M	thought of that before. That would have been too	107: 54, 3M  !
5M	dreadful|~ What an escape|~ Dear Miss Woodhouse,	107: 54, 4M  !
5M	I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being	107: 54, 5M  !
5M	intimate with you for any thing in the world."	107: 54, 6M  !
5A	"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to	107: 54, 7A  !
5A	lose you; but it must have been. You would have	107: 54, 8A  !
5A	thrown yourself out of all good society. I must have	107: 54, 9A  !
5A	given you up."	107: 54,10A  !
5M	"Dear me|~ How should I ever have borne it| It	107: 54,11M  !
5M	would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any	107: 54,12M  !
5M	more|"	107: 54,13M  !
5A	"Dear affectionate creature|~ \You\ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm|~	107: 54,14A  !
5A	\You\ confined to the society of the illiterate	107: 54,15A  !
5A	and vulgar all your life| I wonder how the young man	107: 54,16A  !
5A	could have the assurance to ask it. He must have a pretty	107: 54,17A  !
5A	good opinion of himself."	107: 54,18A  !
5M	"I do not think he is conceited either, in general,"	107: 54,19M  !
5M	"at	107: 54,20M  !
5M	least he is very good natured, and I shall always feel much	107: 54,21M  !
5M	obliged to him, and have a great regard for ~ but that is	107: 54,22M  !
5M	quite a different thing from ~ and you know, though he	107: 54,23M  !
5M	may like me, it does not follow that I should ~ and	107: 54,24M  !
5M	certainly I must confess that since my visiting here	107: 54,25M  !
5M	I have seen people ~ and if one comes to compare them,	107: 54,26M  !
5M	person and manners, there is no comparison at all, \one\	107: 54,27M  !
5M	is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really	107: 54,28M  !
5M	think Mr% Martin a very amiable young man, and have	107: 54,29M  !
5M	a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached	107: 54,30M  !
5M	to me~ and his writing such a letter ~ but as to leaving	107: 54,31M  !
5M	you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration."	107: 54,32M  !
5A	"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.	107: 54,33A  !
5A	We will not be parted. A woman may not marry a man	107: 54,34A  !
5A	merely because she is asked, or because he is attached to	107: 54,35A  !
5A	her, and can write a tolerable letter."	107: 54,36A  !
5M	"Oh| no;~ and it is but a short letter too."	107: 54,37M  !
5A	"very true; and it would be a small consolation	107: 55, 1A  !
5A	to her, for the clownish manner which might be offending	107: 55, 2A  !
5A	her every hour of the day, to know that her husband	107: 55, 3A  !
5A	could write a good letter.""	107: 55, 4A  !
5M	"Oh| yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing	107: 55, 5M  !
5M	is, to be always happy with pleasant companions. I am	107: 55, 6M  !
5M	quite determined to refuse him. But how shall I do?	107: 55, 7M  !
5M	What shall I say?"	107: 55, 8M  !
5M	"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,"	107: 55,29M  !
5A	"Nor if you were, could I ever bear to part with you,	107: 55,31A  !
5A	my Harriet. You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield,	107: 55,32A  !
5A	to be spared to Abbey-Mill."	107: 55,33A  !
5M	"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for	107: 55,34M  !
5M	I am never happy but at Hartfield."	107: 55,35M  !
5M	"I think Mrs% Goddard	107: 55,36M  !
5M	would be very much surprized if she knew what had	107: 55,37M  !
5M	happened. I am sure Miss Nash would ~ for Miss Nash	107: 55,38M  !
5M	thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only	107: 56, 1M  !
5M	a linen-draper."	107: 56, 2M  !
5A	"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement	107: 56, 3A  !
5A	in the teacher of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash	107: 56, 4A  !
5A	would envy you such an opportunity as this of being	107: 56, 5A  !
5A	married. Even this conquest would appear valuable in	107: 56, 6A  !
5A	her eyes. As to anything superior for you, I suppose she	107: 56, 7A  !
5A	is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person	107: 56, 8A  !
5A	can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.	107: 56, 9A  !
5A	Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom	107: 56,10A  !
5A	his looks and manners have explained themselves."	107: 56,11A  !
5M	"Now he has got my letter,"	107: 56,17M  !
5M	"I	107: 56,17M  !
5M	wonder what they are all doing~ whether his sisters	107: 56,18M  !
5M	know~ if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy too.	107: 56,19M  !
5M	I hope he will not mind it so very much.	107: 56,20M  !
5A	"Let us think of those among our absent friends who	107: 56,21A  !
5A	are more cheerfully employed,"	107: 56,22A  !
5A	"At this	107: 56,22A  !
5A	moment, perhaps, Mr% Elton is shewing your picture to	107: 56,23A  !
5A	his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful	107: 56,24A  !
5A	is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,	107: 56,25A  !
5A	allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."	107: 56,26A  !
5M	"My picture|~ But he has left my picture in Bond-street."	107: 56,27M  !
5A	"Has he so|~ Then I know nothing of Mr% Elton. No,	107: 56,29A  !
5A	my dear little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture	107: 56,30A  !
5A	will not be in Bond-street till just before he mounts his	107: 56,31A  !
5A	horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this evening,	107: 56,32A  !
5A	his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,	107: 56,33A  !
5A	it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the	107: 56,34A  !
5A	party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity	107: 56,35A  !
5A	and warm prepossession. How cheerful, how animated,	107: 56,36A  !
5A	how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are|"	107: 56,37A  !
5P	"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr% Knightley,	108: 57,20P  !
5P	if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing,	108: 57,21P  !
5P	I shall take Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of	108: 57,22P  !
5P	an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my	108: 57,23P  !
5P	three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,	108: 57,24P  !
5P	Mr% Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged	108: 57,25P  !
5P	people."	108: 57,26P  !
5B	"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."	108: 57,27B  !
5P	"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.	108: 57,28P  !
5P	Emma will be happy to entertain you. And therefore	108: 57,29P  !
5P	I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns~	108: 57,30P  !
5P	my winter walk."	108: 57,31P  !
5B	"You cannot do better, sir."	108: 57,32B  !
5P	"I would ask for the pleasure of your company,	108: 58, 1P  !
5P	Mr% Knightley, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace	108: 58, 2P  !
5P	would be tedious to you; and besides, you have another	108: 58, 3P  !
5P	long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey."	108: 58, 4P  !
5B	"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment	108: 58, 5B  !
5B	myself; and I think the sooner \you\ go the better. I will	108: 58, 6B  !
5B	fetch your great coat and open the garden door for you."	108: 58, 7B  !
5B	"I cannot rate her beauty as you do,"	108: 58,13B  !
5B	"but	108: 58,13B  !
5B	she is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think	108: 58,14B  !
5B	very well of her disposition. Her character depends upon	108: 58,15B  !
5B	those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out	108: 58,16B  !
5B	a valuable woman."	108: 58,17B  !
5A	"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope	108: 58,18A  !
5A	may not be wanting."	108: 58,19A  !
5B	"Come,"	108: 58,20B  !
5B	"you are anxious for a compliment,	108: 58,20B  !
5B	so I will tell you that you have improved her. You have	108: 58,21B  !
5B	cured her of her school-girl's giggle; she really does you	108: 58,22B  !
5B	credit."	108: 58,23B  !
5A	"Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not	108: 58,24A  !
5A	believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body	108: 58,25A  !
5A	who will bestow praise where they may. \You\ do not often	108: 58,26A  !
5A	overpower me with it."	108: 58,27A  !
5B	"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"	108: 58,28B  !
5A	"Almost every moment. She has been gone longer	108: 58,29A  !
5A	already than she intended."	108: 58,30A  !
5B	"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors	108: 58,31B  !
5B	perhaps."	108: 58,32B  !
5A	"Highbury gossips|~ Tiresome wretches|"	108: 58,33A  !
5B	"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that	108: 58,34B  !
5B	you would."	108: 58,35B  !
5B	"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must	108: 58,38B  !
5B	tell you that I have good reason to believe your little	108: 59, 1B  !
5B	friend will soon hear of something to her advantage."	108: 59, 2B  !
5A	"Indeed| how so? of what sort?"	108: 59, 3A  !
5B	"A very serious sort, I assure you;"	108: 59, 4B  !
5A	"Very serious| I can think of but one thing ~ Who is	108: 59, 5A  !
5A	in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?"	108: 59, 6A  !
5B	"I have reason to think,"	108: 59,10B  !
5B	"that Harriet Smith	108: 59,10B  !
5B	will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most	108: 59,11B  !
5B	unexceptionable quarter:~ Robert Martin is the man.	108: 59,12B  !
5B	Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have done	108: 59,13B  !
5B	his business. He is desperately in love and means to	108: 59,14B  !
5B	marry her."	108: 59,15B  !
5A	"He is very obliging,"	108: 59,16A  !
5A	"but is he sure	108: 59,16A  !
5A	that Harriet means to marry him?"	108: 59,17A  !
5B	"Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will	108: 59,18B  !
5B	that do? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on	108: 59,19B  !
5B	purpose to consult me about it. He knows I have a	108: 59,20B  !
5B	thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,	108: 59,21B  !
5B	considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask	108: 59,22B  !
5B	me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to	108: 59,23B  !
5B	settle so early; whether I thought her too young: in	108: 59,24B  !
5B	short, whether I approved his choice altogether; having	108: 59,25B  !
5B	some apprehension perhaps of her being considered	108: 59,26B  !
5B	(especially since \your\ making so much of her) as in a line	108: 59,27B  !
5B	of society above him. I was very much pleased with all	108: 59,28B  !
5B	that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than	108: 59,29B  !
5B	Robert Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open,	108: 59,30B  !
5B	straight forward, and very well judging. He told me	108: 59,31B  !
5B	every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they	108: 59,32B  !
5B	all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is an	108: 59,33B  !
5B	excellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no	108: 59,34B  !
5B	hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me	108: 59,35B  !
5B	that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was	108: 59,36B  !
5B	convinced he could not do better. I praised the fair lady	108: 59,37B  !
5B	too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he	108: 59,38B  !
5B	had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have	108: 60, 1B  !
5B	thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house	108: 60, 2B  !
5B	thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had.	108: 60, 3B  !
5B	This happened the night before last. Now, as we may	108: 60, 4B  !
5B	fairly suppose, he would not allow much time to pass	108: 60, 5B  !
5B	before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear	108: 60, 6B  !
5B	to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he	108: 60, 7B  !
5B	should be at Mrs% Goddard's to day; and she may be	108: 60, 8B  !
5B	detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome	108: 60, 9B  !
5B	wretch."	108: 60,10B  !
5A	"Pray, Mr% Knightley,"	108: 60,11A  !
5A	"how do you know that Mr% Martin did not speak	108: 60,13A  !
5A	yesterday?"	108: 60,14A  !
5B	"Certainly,"	108: 60,15B  !
5B	"I do not absolutely	108: 60,15B  !
5B	know it; but it may be inferred. Was not she the whole	108: 60,16B  !
5B	day with you?"	108: 60,17B  !
5A	"Come,"	108: 60,18A  !
5A	"I will tell you something, in	108: 60,18A  !
5A	return for what you have told me. He did speak yesterday~	108: 60,19A  !
5A	that is, he wrote, and was refused."	108: 60,20A  !
5B	"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed	108: 60,25B  !
5B	her. What is the foolish girl about?"	108: 60,26B  !
5A	"Oh| to be sure,"	108: 60,27A  !
5A	"it is always incomprehensible	108: 60,27A  !
5A	to a man that a woman should ever refuse an	108: 60,28A  !
5A	offer of marriage. A man always imagines a woman to be	108: 60,29A  !
5A	ready for anybody who asks her."	108: 60,30A  !
5B	"Nonsense| a man does not imagine any such thing.	108: 60,31B  !
5B	But what is the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse	108: 60,32B  !
5B	Robert Martin? madness, if it is so; but I hope you are	108: 60,33B  !
5B	mistaken."	108: 60,34B  !
5A	"I saw her answer, nothing could be clearer."	108: 60,35A  !
5B	"You saw her answer| you wrote her answer too.	108: 60,36B  !
5B	Emma, this is your doing. You persuaded her to refuse	108: 60,37B  !
5B	him."	108: 60,38B  !
5A	"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing,)	108: 61, 1A  !
5A	I should not feel that I had done wrong. Mr% Martin is	108: 61, 2A  !
5A	a very respectable young man, but I cannot admit him	108: 61, 3A  !
5A	to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized indeed	108: 61, 4A  !
5A	that he should have ventured to address her. By your	108: 61, 5A  !
5A	account, he does seem to have had some scruples. It is	108: 61, 6A  !
5A	a pity that they were ever got over."	108: 61, 7A  !
5B	"Not Harriet's equal|"	108: 61, 8B  !
5B	"No, he is not her equal	108: 61,10B  !
5B	indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in	108: 61,11B  !
5B	situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds	108: 61,12B  !
5B	you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth,	108: 61,13B  !
5B	nature or education, to any connection higher than	108: 61,14B  !
5B	Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody	108: 61,15B  !
5B	knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all,	108: 61,16B  !
5B	and certainly no respectable relations. She is known	108: 61,17B  !
5B	only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She is not	108: 61,18B  !
5B	a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been	108: 61,19B  !
5B	taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple	108: 61,20B  !
5B	to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can	108: 61,21B  !
5B	have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very	108: 61,22B  !
5B	likely ever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty,	108: 61,23B  !
5B	and she is good tempered, and that is all. My only	108: 61,24B  !
5B	scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being	108: 61,25B  !
5B	beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt,	108: 61,26B  !
5B	that as to fortune, in all probability he might do much	108: 61,27B  !
5B	better; and that as to a rational companion or useful	108: 61,28B  !
5B	helpmate, he could not do worse. But I could not reason	108: 61,29B  !
5B	so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being	108: 61,30B  !
5B	no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition,	108: 61,31B  !
5B	which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright	108: 61,32B  !
5B	and turn out very well. The advantage of the match	108: 61,33B  !
5B	I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest	108: 61,34B  !
5B	doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general	108: 61,35B  !
5B	cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even \your\ satisfaction	108: 61,36B  !
5B	I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately	108: 61,37B  !
5B	that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury,	108: 61,38B  !
5B	for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember	108: 62, 1B  !
5B	saying to myself,	108: 62, 2B  !
5A	"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of	108: 62, 4A  !
5A	Emma as to say any such thing. What| think a farmer,	108: 62, 5A  !
5A	(and with all his sense and all his merit Mr% Martin is	108: 62, 6A  !
5A	nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend|	108: 62, 7A  !
5A	Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying	108: 62, 8A  !
5A	a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of	108: 62, 9A  !
5A	my own| I wonder you should think it possible for me	108: 62,10A  !
5A	to have such feelings. I assure you mine are very different.	108: 62,11A  !
5A	I must think your statement by no means fair. You are	108: 62,12A  !
5A	not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated	108: 62,13A  !
5A	very differently by others as well as myself; Mr% Martin	108: 62,14A  !
5A	may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly her	108: 62,15A  !
5A	inferior as to rank in society.~ The sphere in which she	108: 62,16A  !
5A	moves is much above his.~ It would be a degradation."	108: 62,17A  !
5B	"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be	108: 62,18B  !
5B	married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer|"	108: 62,19B  !
5A	"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal	108: 62,20A  !
5A	sense she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common	108: 62,21A  !
5A	sense. She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being	108: 62,22A  !
5A	held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.	108: 62,23A  !
5A	~ There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman~	108: 62,24A  !
5A	and a gentleman of fortune.~ Her allowance is very	108: 62,25A  !
5A	liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement	108: 62,26A  !
5A	or comfort.~ That she is a gentleman's daughter, is	108: 62,27A  !
5A	indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen's	108: 62,28A  !
5A	daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.~ She is superior	108: 62,29A  !
5A	to Mr% Robert Martin."	108: 62,30A  !
5B	"Whoever might be her parents,"	108: 62,31B  !
5B	"whoever may have had the charge of her, it does not	108: 62,32B  !
5B	appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce	108: 62,33B  !
5B	her into what you would call good society. After receiving	108: 62,34B  !
5B	a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs% Goddard's	108: 62,35B  !
5B	hands to shift as she can;~ to move, in short, in Mrs% Goddard's	108: 62,36B  !
5B	line, to have Mrs% Goddard's acquaintance.	108: 62,37B  !
5B	Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her;	108: 62,38B  !
5B	and it \was\ good enough. She desired nothing better	108: 63, 1B  !
5B	herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her	108: 63, 2B  !
5B	mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition	108: 63, 3B  !
5B	beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins	108: 63, 4B  !
5B	in the summer. She had no sense of superiority then.	108: 63, 5B  !
5B	If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no	108: 63, 6B  !
5B	friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would	108: 63, 7B  !
5B	never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded	108: 63, 8B  !
5B	of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well.	108: 63, 9B  !
5B	He has too much real feeling to address any woman on	108: 63,10B  !
5B	the hap-hazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he	108: 63,11B  !
5B	is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon	108: 63,12B  !
5B	it he had encouragement."	108: 63,13B  !
5A	"You are a very warm friend to Mr% Martin; but, as	108: 63,17A  !
5A	I said before, are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to	108: 63,18A  !
5A	marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them.	108: 63,19A  !
5A	She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense than you	108: 63,20A  !
5A	are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding	108: 63,21A  !
5A	spoken of so slightingly. Waving that point, however,	108: 63,22A  !
5A	and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty	108: 63,23A  !
5A	and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she	108: 63,24A  !
5A	possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to	108: 63,25A  !
5A	the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl,	108: 63,26A  !
5A	and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an	108: 63,27A  !
5A	hundred; and till it appears that men are much more	108: 63,28A  !
5A	philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are	108: 63,29A  !
5A	generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well-informed	108: 63,30A  !
5A	minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with	108: 63,31A  !
5A	such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being	108: 63,32A  !
5A	admired and sought after, of having the power of choosing	108: 63,33A  !
5A	from among many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her	108: 63,34A  !
5A	good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending,	108: 63,35A  !
5A	as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper	108: 63,36A  !
5A	and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great	108: 63,37A  !
5A	readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very	108: 63,38A  !
5A	much mistaken if your sex in general would not think	108: 64, 1A  !
5A	such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman	108: 64, 2A  !
5A	could possess."	108: 64, 3A  !
5B	"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the	108: 64, 4B  !
5B	reason you have, is almost enough to make me think so	108: 64, 5B  !
5B	too. Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do."	108: 64, 6B  !
5A	"To be sure|"	108: 64, 7A  !
5A	"I know \that\ is	108: 64, 7A  !
5A	the feeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet	108: 64, 8A  !
5A	is exactly what every man delights in ~ what at once	108: 64, 9A  !
5A	bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment. Oh|	108: 64,10A  !
5A	Harriet may pick and choose. Were you, yourself, ever	108: 64,11A  !
5A	to marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at	108: 64,12A  !
5A	seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be	108: 64,13A  !
5A	known, to be wondered at because she does not accept	108: 64,14A  !
5A	the first offer she receives? No~ pray let her have time	108: 64,15A  !
5A	to look about her."	108: 64,16A  !
5B	"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,"	108: 64,17B  !
5B	"though I have kept my	108: 64,18B  !
5B	thoughts to myself; but I now perceive that it will be	108: 64,19B  !
5B	a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up	108: 64,20B  !
5B	with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has	108: 64,21B  !
5B	a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach	108: 64,22B  !
5B	will be good enough for her. Vanity working on a weak	108: 64,23B  !
5B	head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy	108: 64,24B  !
5B	as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high.	108: 64,25B  !
5B	Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow	108: 64,26B  !
5B	in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense,	108: 64,27B  !
5B	whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.	108: 64,28B  !
5B	Men of family would not be very fond of connecting	108: 64,29B  !
5B	themselves with a girl of such obscurity ~ and most	108: 64,30B  !
5B	prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and	108: 64,31B  !
5B	disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of	108: 64,32B  !
5B	her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry	108: 64,33B  !
5B	Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy	108: 64,34B  !
5B	for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry	108: 64,35B  !
5B	greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less	108: 64,36B  !
5B	than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be	108: 64,37B  !
5B	a parlour-boarder at Mrs% Goddard's all the rest of her	108: 64,38B  !
5B	life~ or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will	108: 65, 1B  !
5B	marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and	108: 65, 2B  !
5B	is glad to catch at the old writing master's son."	108: 65, 3B  !
5A	"We think so very differently on this point, Mr% Knightley,	108: 65, 4A  !
5A	that there can be no use in canvassing it. We shall	108: 65, 5A  !
5A	only be making each other more angry. But as to my	108: 65, 6A  !
5A	\letting\ her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she has	108: 65, 7A  !
5A	refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent	108: 65, 8A  !
5A	any second application. She must abide by the evil of	108: 65, 9A  !
5A	having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the	108: 65,10A  !
5A	refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not	108: 65,11A  !
5A	influence her a little; but I assure you there was very	108: 65,12A  !
5A	little for me or for anybody to do. His appearance is so	108: 65,13A  !
5A	much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she	108: 65,14A  !
5A	ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can	108: 65,15A  !
5A	imagine, that before she had seen anybody superior, she	108: 65,16A  !
5A	might tolerate him. He was the brother of her friends,	108: 65,17A  !
5A	and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having	108: 65,18A  !
5A	seen nobody better (that must have been his great assistant)	108: 65,19A  !
5A	she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find	108: 65,20A  !
5A	him disagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows	108: 65,21A  !
5A	now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman	108: 65,22A  !
5A	in education and manner has any chance with Harriet."	108: 65,23A  !
5B	"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked|"	108: 65,24B  !
5B	"Robert Martin's manners have	108: 65,25B  !
5B	sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend them;	108: 65,26B  !
5B	and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith	108: 65,27B  !
5B	could understand."	108: 65,28B  !
5B	"Robert Martin has no great loss~ if he can but think	108: 66, 4B  !
5B	so; and I hope it will not be long before he does. Your	108: 66, 5B  !
5B	views for Harriet are best known to yourself; but as you	108: 66, 6B  !
5B	make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to	108: 66, 7B  !
5B	suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;~	108: 66, 8B  !
5B	and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the	108: 66, 9B  !
5B	man, I think it will be all labour in vain."	108: 66,10B  !
5B	"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very	108: 66,12B  !
5B	good sort of man, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury,	108: 66,13B  !
5B	but not at all likely to make an imprudent match. He	108: 66,14B  !
5B	knows the value of a good income as well as anybody.	108: 66,15B  !
5B	Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally.	108: 66,16B  !
5B	He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can	108: 66,17B  !
5B	be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome	108: 66,18B  !
5B	young man, and a great favourite wherever he goes; and	108: 66,19B  !
5B	from his general way of talking in unreserved moments,	108: 66,20B  !
5B	when there are only men present, I am convinced that he	108: 66,21B  !
5B	does not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him	108: 66,22B  !
5B	speak with great animation of a large family of young	108: 66,23B  !
5B	ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all	108: 66,24B  !
5B	twenty thousand apiece."	108: 66,25B  !
5A	"I am very much obliged to you,"	108: 66,26A  !
5A	"If I had set my heart on Mr% Elton's marrying	108: 66,27A  !
5A	Harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes;	108: 66,28A  !
5A	but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself.	108: 66,29A  !
5A	I have done with match-making indeed. I could never	108: 66,30A  !
5A	hope to equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave	108: 66,31A  !
5A	off while I am well."	108: 66,32A  !

5M	can it possibly be? Do try to find it out, Miss Woodhouse.	109: 72,29M  !
5M	Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is	109: 72,30M  !

5M	Can it be woman?	109: 72,33M  !
5M	Can it be Neptune?	109: 72,35M  !
5M	Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no|	109: 73, 1M  !
5M	shark is only one syllable. It must be very clever, or he	109: 73, 2M  !
5M	would not have brought it. Oh| Miss Woodhouse, do	109: 73, 3M  !
5M	you think we shall ever find it out?"	109: 73, 4M  !
5A	"Mermaids and sharks| Nonsense| My dear Harriet,	109: 73, 5A  !
5A	what are you thinking of? Where would be the use of	109: 73, 6A  !
5A	his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid	109: 73, 7A  !
5A	or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.	109: 73, 8A  !

5A	(\courtship\, you know,)	109: 73,16A  !
5A	A very proper compliment|~ and then follows the	109: 73,20A  !
5A	application, which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot	109: 73,21A  !
5A	find much difficulty in comprehending. Read it in	109: 73,22A  !
5A	comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of its being	109: 73,23A  !
5A	written for you and to you."	109: 73,24A  !
5A	"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in	109: 73,30A  !
5A	this compliment,"	109: 73,31A  !
5A	"that I cannot have a	109: 73,31A  !
5A	moment's doubt as to Mr% Elton's intentions. You are	109: 73,32A  !
5A	his object ~ and you will soon receive the completest proof	109: 73,33A  !
5A	of it. I thought it must be so. I thought I could not be	109: 73,34A  !
5A	so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind	109: 73,35A  !
5A	is as clear and decided, as my wishes on the subject have	109: 73,36A  !

5A	have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen	109: 73,38A  !

5A	you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield	109: 74,10A  !
5A	and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This,	109: 74,11A  !
5A	Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in	109: 74,12A  !
5A	either of us."	109: 74,13A  !

5M	"and therefore I suppose, and believe, and hope it must	109: 74,22M  !
5M	be so; but otherwise I could not have imagined it. It is	109: 74,23M  !
5M	so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr% Elton, who	109: 74,24M  !
5M	might marry any body| There cannot be two opinions	109: 74,25M  !
5M	about \him\. He is so very superior. Only think of those	109: 74,26M  !
5M	sweet verses~ ""To Miss @@@@."" Dear me, how clever|~	109: 74,27M  !
5M	Could it really be meant for me?"	109: 74,28M  !
5A	"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question	109: 74,29A  !
5A	about that. It is a certainty. Receive it on my judgment.	109: 74,30A  !
5A	It is a sort of prologue to the play, a motto to the	109: 74,31A  !
5A	chapter; and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact	109: 74,32A  !
5A	prose."	109: 74,33A  !

5M	The strangest things do take place|"	109: 74,36M  !
5A	"When Miss Smiths and Mr% Eltons get acquainted ~	109: 74,37A  !
5A	they do indeed ~ and really it is strange; it is out of the	109: 74,38A  !
5A	common course that what is so evidently, so palpably	109: 75, 1A  !
5A	desirable ~ what courts the pre-arrangement of other	109: 75, 2A  !
5A	people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper	109: 75, 3A  !
5A	form. You and Mr% Elton are by situation called together;	109: 75, 4A  !
5A	you belong to one another by every circumstance of your	109: 75, 5A  !
5A	respective homes. Your marrying will be equal to the	109: 75, 6A  !
5A	match at Randalls. There does seem to be a something	109: 75, 7A  !
5A	in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right	109: 75, 8A  !
5A	direction, and sends it into the very channel where it	109: 75, 9A  !
5A	ought to flow.	109: 75,10A  !
5A	The course of true love never did run smooth~	109: 75,11A  !

5M	Michaelmas| And he, the very handsomest man that	109: 75,16M  !
5M	ever was, and a man that every body looks up to, quite	109: 75,17M  !
5M	like Mr% Knightley| His company so sought after, that	109: 75,18M  !
5M	every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself	109: 75,19M  !
5M	if he does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than	109: 75,20M  !
5M	there are days in the week. And so excellent in the	109: 75,21M  !
5M	Church| Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has	109: 75,22M  !
5M	ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear	109: 75,23M  !
5M	me| When I look back to the first time I saw him| How	109: 75,24M  !
5M	little did I think|~ The two Abbotts and I ran into the	109: 75,25M  !
5M	front room and peeped through the blind when we heard	109: 75,26M  !
5M	he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us	109: 75,27M  !
5M	away, and staid to look through herself; however, she	109: 75,28M  !
5M	called me back presently, and let me look too, which	109: 75,29M  !
5M	was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought	109: 75,30M  !
5M	he looked| He was arm in arm with Mr% Cole."	109: 75,31M  !

5A	friends may be, must be agreeable to them, provided at	109: 75,33A  !
5A	least they have common sense; and we are not to be	109: 75,34A  !
5A	addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to	109: 75,35A  !
5A	see you \happily\ married, here is a man whose amiable	109: 75,36A  !
5A	character gives every assurance of it;~ if they wish to	109: 75,37A  !
5A	have you settled in the same country and circle which	109: 76, 1A  !
5A	they have chosen to place you in, here it will be accomplished;	109: 76, 2A  !
5A	and if their only object is that you should, in	109: 76, 3A  !
5A	the common phrase, be \well\ married, here is the comfortable	109: 76, 4A  !
5A	fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in	109: 76, 5A  !

5M	you. You understand every thing. You and Mr% Elton	109: 76, 8M  !

5A	"I do not consider its length as particularly in its	109: 76,18A  !
5A	favour. Such things in general cannot be too short."	109: 76,19A  !

5M	down and write a letter, and say just what you must, in	109: 76,25M  !
5M	a short way; and another, to write verses and charades	109: 76,26M  !

5M	or say I have found it out?~ Oh| Miss Woodhouse, what	109: 76,32M  !
5M	can we do about that?"	109: 76,33M  !
5A	"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here	109: 76,34A  !
5A	this evening, I dare say, and then I will give it him back,	109: 76,35A  !

5M	write this beautiful charade into my book| I am sure	109: 77, 2M  !
5M	I have not got one half so good."	109: 77, 3M  !

5A	"~~ The best of all. Granted;~ for private enjoyment;	109: 77, 7A  !
5A	and for private enjoyment keep them. They are	109: 77, 8A  !
5A	not at all the less written you know, because you divide	109: 77, 9A  !
5A	them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its	109: 77,10A  !
5A	meaning change. But take it away, and all \appropriation\	109: 77,11A  !
5A	ceases, and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for	109: 77,12A  !
5A	any collection. Depend upon it, he would not like to have	109: 77,13A  !
5A	his charade slighted, much better than his passion. A	109: 77,14A  !
5A	poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or	109: 77,15A  !
5A	neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and	109: 77,16A  !
5A	then there can be no possible reflection on you."	109: 77,17A  !
5M	"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,"	109: 77,22M  !
5A	"Very well,"	109: 77,24A  !
5A	"a most natural feeling;	109: 77,24A  !

5A	here is my father coming: you will not object to my reading	109: 77,26A  !
5A	the charade to him. It will be giving him so much	109: 77,27A  !
5A	pleasure| He loves any thing of the sort, and especially	109: 77,28A  !
5A	any thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the	109: 77,29A  !
5A	tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all|~ You must	109: 77,30A  !
5A	let me read it to him."	109: 77,31A  !
5A	"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon	109: 77,33A  !
5A	this charade.~ You will betray your feelings improperly,	109: 77,34A  !
5A	if you are too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix	109: 77,35A  !
5A	more meaning, or even quite all the meaning which may	109: 77,36A  !
5A	be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little	109: 77,37A  !
5A	tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy,	109: 77,38A  !
5A	he would not have left the paper while I was by; but he	109: 78, 1A  !
5A	rather pushed it towards you. Do not	109: 78, 2A  !
5A	let us be too solemn on the business. He has encouragement	109: 78, 3A  !
5A	enough to proceed, without our sighing out our	109: 78, 4A  !
5A	souls over this charade."	109: 78, 5A  !
5M	"Oh| no~ I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it.	109: 78, 6M  !
5M	Do as you please."	109: 78, 7M  !
5P	"Well, my dears, how does your book go on?~ Have	109: 78,10P  !
5P	you got any thing fresh?"	109: 78,11P  !
5A	"Yes, papa, we have something to read you, something	109: 78,12A  !
5A	quite fresh. A piece of paper was found on the table this	109: 78,13A  !
5A	morning~ (dropt, we suppose, by a fairy)~ containing	109: 78,14A  !
5A	a very pretty charade, and we have just copied it in."	109: 78,15A  !
5P	"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly	109: 78,21P  !
5P	said. Very true. ""Woman, lovely woman."" It is such	109: 78,22P  !
5P	a pretty charade, my dear, that I can easily guess what	109: 78,23P  !
5P	fairy brought it.~ Nobody could have written so prettily,	109: 78,24P  !
5P	but you, Emma."	109: 78,25P  !
5P	"Ah| it is no difficulty to see who you take after|	109: 78,28P  !
5P	Your dear mother was so clever at all those things| If	109: 78,29P  !
5P	I had but her memory| But I can remember nothing;~	109: 78,30P  !
5P	not even that particular riddle which you have heard me	109: 78,31P  !
5P	mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there	109: 78,32P  !
5P	are several.	109: 78,33P  !
5P	And that is all that I can recollect of it ~ but it is very	109: 78,39P  !
5P	clever all the way through. But I think, my dear, you	109: 79, 1P  !
5P	said you had got it."	109: 79, 2P  !
5A	"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We	109: 79, 3A  !
5A	copied it from the Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick's,	109: 79, 4A  !
5A	you know."	109: 79, 5A  !
5P	"Aye, very true.~ I wish I could recollect more of it.	109: 79, 6P  !
5P	The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was	109: 79, 8P  !
5P	very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama.	109: 79, 9P  !
5P	I hope we shall have her here next week. Have you	109: 79,10P  !
5P	thought, my dear, where you shall put her ~ and what	109: 79,11P  !
5P	room there will be for the children?"	109: 79,12P  !
5A	"Oh| yes~ she will have her own room, of course;	109: 79,13A  !
5A	the room she always has;~ and there is the nursery for	109: 79,14A  !
5A	the children,~ just as usual, you know.~ Why should	109: 79,15A  !
5A	there be any change?"	109: 79,16A  !
5P	"I do not know, my dear ~ but it is so long since she	109: 79,17P  !
5P	was here|~ not since last Easter, and then only for a few	109: 79,18P  !
5P	days.~ Mr% John Knightley's being a lawyer is very	109: 79,19P  !
5P	inconvenient.~ Poor Isabella|~ she is sadly taken away	109: 79,20P  !
5P	from us all|~ and how sorry she will be when she comes,	109: 79,21P  !
5P	not to see Miss Taylor here|"	109: 79,22P  !
5A	"She will not be surprized, papa, at least."	109: 79,23A  !
5P	"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much	109: 79,24P  !
5P	surprized when I first heard she was going to be married."	109: 79,25P  !
5A	"We must ask Mr% and Mrs% Weston to dine with us,	109: 79,26A  !
5A	while Isabella is here."	109: 79,27A  !
5P	"Yes, my dear, if there is time.~ But~	109: 79,28P  !
5P	~ she is coming for only one week. There	109: 79,29P  !
5P	will not be time for any thing."	109: 79,30P  !
5A	"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer~ but	109: 79,31A  !
5A	it seems a case of necessity. Mr% John Knightley must be	109: 79,32A  !
5A	in town again on the 28th, and we ought to be thankful,	109: 79,33A  !
5A	papa, that we are to have the whole of the time they can	109: 79,34A  !
5A	give to the country, that two or three days are not to be	109: 79,35A  !
5A	taken out for the Abbey. Mr% Knightley promises to give	109: 79,36A  !
5A	up his claim this Christmas~ though you know it is longer	109: 79,37A  !
5A	since they were with him, than with us."	109: 79,38A  !
5P	"It would be very hard indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella	109: 80, 1P  !
5P	were to be anywhere but at Hartfield."	109: 80, 2P  !
5P	"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged	109: 80, 7P  !
5P	to go back so soon, though he does. I think, Emma,	109: 80, 8P  !
5P	I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us. She	109: 80, 9P  !
5P	and the children might stay very well."	109: 80,10P  !
5A	"Ah| papa ~ that is what you never have been able	109: 80,11A  !
5A	to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will. Isabella	109: 80,12A  !
5A	cannot bear to stay behind her husband."	109: 80,13A  !
5A	"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she	109: 80,20A  !
5A	can while my brother and sister are here. I am sure she	109: 80,21A  !
5A	will be pleased with the children. We are very proud	109: 80,22A  !
5A	of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she	109: 80,23A  !
5A	will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"	109: 80,24A  !
5P	"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how	109: 80,25P  !
5P	glad they will be to come. They are very fond of being	109: 80,26P  !
5P	at Hartfield, Harriet."	109: 80,27P  !
5M	"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know	109: 80,28M  !
5M	who is not."	109: 80,29M  !
5P	"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mamma.	109: 80,30P  !
5P	Henry is the eldest, he was named after me, not after	109: 80,31P  !
5P	his father. John, the second, is named after his father.	109: 80,32P  !
5P	Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was	109: 80,33P  !
5P	not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which	109: 80,34P  !
5P	I thought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever	109: 80,35P  !
5P	boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they	109: 80,36P  !
5P	have so many pretty ways. They will come and stand	109: 80,37P  !
5P	by my chair, and say,	109: 80,38P  !
5P	and once Henry asked me for a knife, but	109: 81, 1P  !
5P	I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. I think	109: 81, 2P  !
5P	their father is too rough with them very often."	109: 81, 3P  !
5A	"He appears rough to you,"	109: 81, 4A  !
5A	"because you	109: 81, 4A  !
5A	are so very gentle yourself; but if you could compare him	109: 81, 5A  !
5A	with other papas, you would not think him rough. He	109: 81, 6A  !
5A	wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they	109: 81, 7A  !
5A	misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then;	109: 81, 8A  !
5A	but he is an affectionate father~ certainly Mr% John Knightley	109: 81, 9A  !
5A	is an affectionate father. The children are all	109: 81,10A  !
5A	fond of him."	109: 81,11A  !
5P	"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up	109: 81,12P  !
5P	to the ceiling in a very frightful way|"	109: 81,13P  !
5A	"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so	109: 81,14A  !
5A	much. It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle	109: 81,15A  !
5A	did not lay down the rule of their taking turns, which ever	109: 81,16A  !
5A	began would never give way to the other."	109: 81,17A  !
5P	"Well, I cannot understand it."	109: 81,18P  !
5A	"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the	109: 81,19A  !
5A	world cannot understand the pleasures of the other."	109: 81,20A  !
5A	"Oh| here's the charade you were so obliging as to	109: 82, 3A  !
5A	leave with us; thank you for the sight of it. We admired	109: 82, 4A  !
5A	it so much, that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith's	109: 82, 5A  !
5A	collection. Your friend will not take it amiss	109: 82, 6A  !
5A	I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the eight	109: 82, 7A  !
5A	first lines."	109: 82, 8A  !
5A	"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so	109: 82,15A  !
5A	good a charade must not be confined to one or two. He	109: 82,16A  !
5A	may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes	109: 82,17A  !
5A	with such gallantry."	109: 82,18A  !
5A	"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one	110: 83,18A  !
5A	of these days."~	110: 83,19A  !
5M	"Oh| what a sweet house|~ How very beautiful|~	110: 83,20M  !
5M	There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so	110: 83,21M  !
5M	much."	110: 83,22M  !
5A	"I do not often walk this way \now\,"	110: 83,23A  !
5A	"but \then\ there will be an inducement,	110: 83,24A  !
5A	and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all	110: 83,25A  !
5A	the hedges, gates, pools, and pollards of this part of	110: 83,26A  !
5A	Highbury."	110: 83,27A  !
5A	"I wish we could contrive it,"	110: 83,33A  !
5A	"but I cannot	110: 83,33A  !
5A	think of any tolerable pretence for going in;~ no servant	110: 84, 1A  !
5A	that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper ~ no	110: 84, 2A  !
5A	message from my father."	110: 84, 3A  !
5M	"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not	110: 84, 7M  !
5M	be married, or going to be married| so charming as you	110: 84, 8M  !
5M	are|"~	110: 84, 9M  !
5A	"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to	110: 84,11A  !
5A	induce me to marry; I must find other people charming~	110: 84,12A  !
5A	one other person at least. And I am not only, not going	110: 84,13A  !
5A	to be married, at present, but have very little intention	110: 84,14A  !
5A	of ever marrying at all."	110: 84,15A  !
5M	"Ah| ~ so you say; but I cannot believe it."	110: 84,16M  !
5A	"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have	110: 84,17A  !
5A	seen yet, to be tempted; Mr% Elton, you know,	110: 84,18A  !
5A	is out of the question: and I do \not\ wish to see	110: 84,19A  !
5A	any such person. I would rather not be tempted. I	110: 84,20A  !
5A	cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry,	110: 84,21A  !
5A	I must expect to repent it."	110: 84,22A  !
5M	"Dear me|~ it is so odd to hear a woman talk so|"~	110: 84,23M  !
5A	"I have none of the usual inducements of women to	110: 84,24A  !
5A	marry. Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a	110: 84,25A  !
5A	different thing| but I never have been in love; it is not	110: 84,26A  !
5A	my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.	110: 84,27A  !
5A	And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change	110: 84,28A  !
5A	such a situation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment	110: 84,29A  !
5A	I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe	110: 84,30A  !
5A	few married women are half as much mistress of	110: 84,31A  !
5A	their husband's house, as I am of Hartfield; and never,	110: 84,32A  !
5A	never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important;	110: 84,33A  !
5A	so always first and always right in any man's eyes as I am	110: 84,34A  !
5A	in my father's."	110: 84,35A  !
5M	"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates|"	110: 84,36M  !
5A	"That is as formidable an image as you could present,	110: 84,37A  !
5A	Harriet; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates|	110: 84,38A  !
5A	so silly~ so satisfied~ so smiling~ so prosing~ so	110: 85, 1A  !
5A	undistinguishing and unfastidious~ and so apt to tell	110: 85, 2A  !
5A	every thing relative to every body about me, I would	110: 85, 3A  !
5A	marry to-morrow. But between \us\, I am convinced there	110: 85, 4A  !
5A	never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."	110: 85, 5A  !
5M	"But still, you will be an old maid| and that's so	110: 85, 6M  !
5M	dreadful|"	110: 85, 7M  !
5A	"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid;	110: 85, 8A  !
5A	and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible	110: 85, 9A  !
5A	to a generous public| A single woman, with a very	110: 85,10A  !
5A	narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable, old	110: 85,11A  !
5A	maid| the proper sport of boys and girls; but a single	110: 85,12A  !
5A	woman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may	110: 85,13A  !
5A	be as sensible and pleasant as anybody else. And the	110: 85,14A  !
5A	distinction is not quite so much against the candour and	110: 85,15A  !
5A	common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very	110: 85,16A  !
5A	narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and	110: 85,17A  !
5A	sour the temper. Those who can barely live, and who	110: 85,18A  !
5A	live perforce in a very small, and generally very inferior,	110: 85,19A  !
5A	society, may well be illiberal and cross. This does not	110: 85,20A  !
5A	apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good	110: 85,21A  !
5A	natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is	110: 85,22A  !
5A	very much to the taste of everybody, though single and	110: 85,23A  !
5A	though poor. Poverty certainly has not contracted her	110: 85,24A  !
5A	mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the	110: 85,25A  !
5A	world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of	110: 85,26A  !
5A	it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm."	110: 85,27A  !
5M	"Dear me| but what shall you do? how shall you	110: 85,28M  !
5M	employ yourself when you grow old?"	110: 85,29M  !
5A	"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy	110: 85,30A  !
5A	mind, with a great many independent resources; and	110: 85,31A  !
5A	I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment	110: 85,32A  !
5A	at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's	110: 85,33A  !
5A	usual occupations of eye and hand and mind will be as	110: 85,34A  !
5A	open to me then, as they are now; or with no important	110: 85,35A  !
5A	variation. If I draw less, I shall read more; if I give up	110: 85,36A  !
5A	music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for objects of	110: 85,37A  !
5A	interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the	110: 85,38A  !
5A	great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the	110: 86, 1A  !
5A	great evil to be avoided in \not\ marrying, I shall be very	110: 86, 2A  !
5A	well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to	110: 86, 3A  !
5A	care about. There will be enough of them, in all probability,	110: 86, 4A  !
5A	to supply every sort of sensation that declining	110: 86, 5A  !
5A	life can need. There will be enough for every hope and	110: 86, 6A  !
5A	every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal	110: 86, 7A  !
5A	that of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than	110: 86, 8A  !
5A	what is warmer and blinder. My nephews and nieces|~	110: 86, 9A  !
5A	I shall often have a niece with me."	110: 86,10A  !
5M	"Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know	110: 86,11M  !
5M	you must have seen her a hundred times~ but are you	110: 86,12M  !
5M	acquainted?"	110: 86,13M  !
5A	"Oh| yes; we are always forced to be acquainted	110: 86,14A  !
5A	whenever she comes to Highbury. By the bye, \that\ is	110: 86,15A  !
5A	almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece.	110: 86,16A  !
5A	Heaven forbid| at least, that I should ever bore people	110: 86,17A  !
5A	half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she	110: 86,18A  !
5A	does about Jane Fairfax. One is sick of the very name	110: 86,19A  !
5A	of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from her is read forty times	110: 86,20A  !
5A	over; her compliments to all friends go round and round	110: 86,21A  !
5A	again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of	110: 86,22A  !
5A	a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother,	110: 86,23A  !
5A	one hears of nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax	110: 86,24A  !
5A	very well; but she tires me to death."	110: 86,25A  !
5A	"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How	110: 87, 3A  !
5A	trifling they make every thing else appear|~ I feel now	110: 87, 4A  !
5A	as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all	110: 87, 5A  !
5A	the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it	110: 87, 6A  !
5A	may all vanish from my mind?"	110: 87, 7A  !
5M	"Very true,"	110: 87, 8M  !
5M	"Poor creatures| one can	110: 87, 8M  !
5M	think of nothing else."	110: 87, 9M  !
5A	"And really, I do not think the impression will soon	110: 87,10A  !
5A	be over,"	110: 87,11A  !
5A	"I do not think it will,"	110: 87,14A  !
5M	"Oh| dear, no,"	110: 87,17M  !
5A	"Ah| Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our	110: 87,22A  !
5A	stability in good thoughts. Well,	110: 87,23A  !
5A	I hope it may	110: 87,23A  !
5A	be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and	110: 87,24A  !
5A	relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly important.	110: 87,25A  !
5A	If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can for	110: 87,26A  !
5A	them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to	110: 87,27A  !
5A	ourselves."	110: 87,28A  !
5M	"Oh| dear, yes,"	110: 87,29M  !
5A	"Part of my lace is gone,"	110: 89,17A  !
5A	"and I do not	110: 89,17A  !
5A	know how I am to contrive. I really am a most troublesome	110: 89,18A  !
5A	companion to you both, but I hope I am not often	110: 89,19A  !
5A	so ill-equipped. Mr% Elton, I must beg leave to stop at	110: 89,20A  !
5A	your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband	110: 89,21A  !
5A	or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on."	110: 89,22A  !
5P	"Ah| my dear,"	111: 93,33P  !
5P	"poor Miss Taylor ~ It is	111: 93,33P  !
5P	a grievous business|"	111: 93,34P  !
5P	"Pretty well, my dear ~ I hope~ pretty well.~ I do	111: 94, 3P  !
5P	not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably."	111: 94, 4P  !
5A	"Oh| no~ none in the least. I never saw Mrs% Weston	111: 94, 7A  !
5A	better in my life~ never looking so well. Papa is only	111: 94, 8A  !
5A	speaking his own regret."	111: 94, 9A  !
5P	"Not near so often, my	111: 94,14P  !
5P	dear, as I could wish."	111: 94,15P  !
5A	"Oh| papa, we have missed seeing them but one	111: 94,16A  !
5A	entire day since they married. Either in the morning or	111: 94,17A  !
5A	evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either	111: 94,18A  !
5A	Mr% Weston or Mrs% Weston, and generally both, either	111: 94,19A  !
5A	at Randalls or here~ and as you may suppose, Isabella,	111: 94,20A  !
5A	most frequently here. They are very, very kind in their	111: 94,21A  !
5A	visits. Mr% Weston is really as kind as herself. Papa, if	111: 94,22A  !
5A	you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving	111: 94,23A  !
5A	Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be aware	111: 94,24A  !
5A	that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought	111: 94,25A  !
5A	also to be assured that Mr% and Mrs% Weston do really	111: 94,26A  !
5A	prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we	111: 94,27A  !
5A	ourselves anticipated~ which is the exact truth."	111: 94,28A  !
5P	"Why to be sure,"	111: 94,37P  !
5P	"yes, certainly~	111: 94,37P  !
5P	I cannot deny that Mrs% Weston, poor Mrs% Weston	111: 94,38P  !
5P	does come and see us pretty often ~ but then ~ she is	111: 95, 1P  !
5P	always obliged to go away again."	111: 95, 2P  !
5A	"It would be very hard upon Mr% Weston if she did not,	111: 95, 3A  !
5A	papa.~ You quite forget poor Mr% Weston.	111: 95, 4A  !
5A	"He has not been here yet,"	111: 95,34A  !
5A	"There	111: 95,34A  !
5A	was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the	111: 95,35A  !
5A	marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard	111: 95,36A  !
5A	him mentioned lately."	111: 95,37A  !
5P	"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,"	111: 95,38P  !
5P	"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs% Weston, to	111: 96, 1P  !
5P	congratulate her, and a very proper, handsome letter it	111: 96, 2P  !
5P	was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very well done of	111: 96, 3P  !
5P	him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one	111: 96, 4P  !
5P	cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle perhaps~~"	111: 96, 5P  !
5A	"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty.~ You forget	111: 96, 6A  !
5A	how time passes."	111: 96, 7A  !
5P	"Three-and-twenty|~ is he indeed?~ Well, I could	111: 96, 8P  !
5P	not have thought it~ and he was but two years old when	111: 96, 9P  !
5P	he lost his poor mother| Well, time does fly indeed|~	111: 96,10P  !
5P	and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceedingly	111: 96,11P  !
5P	good, pretty letter, and gave Mr% and Mrs% Weston	111: 96,12P  !
5P	a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from	111: 96,13P  !
5P	Weymouth, and dated Sept% 28th~ and began, ""My dear	111: 96,14P  !
5P	Madam,"" but I forget how it went on; and it was signed	111: 96,15P  !
5P	""F% C% Weston Churchill.""~ I remember that perfectly."	111: 96,16P  !
5A	"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our	112: 98,27A  !
5A	nephews and nieces. As to men and women, our opinions	112: 98,28A  !
5A	are sometimes very different; but with regard to these	112: 98,29A  !
5A	children, I observe we never disagree."	112: 98,30A  !
5B	"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate	112: 98,31B  !
5B	of men and women, and as little under the power of fancy	112: 98,32B  !
5B	and whim in your dealings with them, as you are where	112: 99, 1B  !
5B	these children are concerned, we might always think	112: 99, 2B  !
5B	alike."	112: 99, 3B  !
5A	"To be sure~ our discordancies must always arise	112: 99, 4A  !
5A	from my being in the wrong."	112: 99, 5A  !
5B	"Yes,"	112: 99, 6B  !
5B	"and reason good. I was	112: 99, 6B  !
5B	sixteen years old when you were born."	112: 99, 7B  !
5A	"A material difference then,"	112: 99, 8A  !
5A	"and no	112: 99, 8A  !
5A	doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that	112: 99, 9A  !
5A	period of our lives; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty	112: 99,10A  !
5A	years bring our understandings a good deal	112: 99,11A  !
5A	nearer?"	112: 99,12A  !
5B	"Yes~ a good deal \nearer\."	112: 99,13B  !
5A	"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of	112: 99,14A  !
5A	being right, if we think differently."	112: 99,15A  !
5B	"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years'	112: 99,16B  !
5B	experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and	112: 99,17B  !
5B	a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma, let us be friends	112: 99,18B  !
5B	and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little Emma,	112: 99,19B  !
5B	that she ought to set you a better example than to be	112: 99,20B  !
5B	renewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong	112: 99,21B  !
5B	before, she is now."	112: 99,22B  !
5A	"That's true,"	112: 99,23A  !
5A	"very true. Little Emma,	112: 99,23A  !
5A	grow up a better woman than your aunt. Be infinitely	112: 99,24A  !
5A	cleverer and not half so conceited. Now, Mr% Knightley,	112: 99,25A  !
5A	a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good	112: 99,26A  !
5A	intentions went, we were \both\ right, and I must say that	112: 99,27A  !
5A	no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved	112: 99,28A  !
5A	wrong. I only want to know that Mr% Martin is not very,	112: 99,29A  !
5A	very bitterly disappointed."	112: 99,30A  !
5B	"A man cannot be more so,"	112: 99,31B  !
5A	"Ah|~ Indeed I am very sorry.~ Come, shake hands	112: 99,32A  !
5A	with me."	112: 99,33A  !
5B	"John, how are you?"	112: 99,36B  !
5P	"My poor dear Isabella,"	112:100,30P  !
5P	"How long it	112:100,32P  !
5P	is, how terribly long since you were here| And how tired	112:100,33P  !
5P	you must be after your journey| You must go to bed	112:100,34P  !
5P	early, my dear~ and I recommend a little gruel to you	112:100,35P  !
5P	before you go.~ You and I will have a nice basin of gruel	112:100,36P  !
5P	together. My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little	112:100,37P  !
5P	gruel."	112:100,38P  !
5P	"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending	112:101, 8P  !
5P	the autumn at South End instead of coming here. I never	112:101, 9P  !
5P	had much opinion of the sea air."	112:101,10P  !
5P	"Ah| my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the	112:101,15P  !
5P	sea doing her any good; and as to myself, I have been	112:101,16P  !
5P	long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never told you	112:101,17P  !
5P	so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body.	112:101,18P  !
5P	I am sure it almost killed me once."	112:101,19P  !
5A	"Come, come,"	112:101,20A  !
5A	"I must beg you not to talk of the sea.	112:101,21A  !
5A	It makes me envious and miserable;~ I who have never	112:101,22A  !
5A	seen it| South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear	112:101,23A  !
5A	Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry after	112:101,24A  !
5A	Mr% Perry yet; and he never forgets you."	112:101,25A  !
5P	"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry	112:101,27P  !
5P	is bilious, and he has not time to take care of himself~	112:101,28P  !
5P	he tells me he has not time to take care of himself~ which	112:101,29P  !
5P	is very sad~ but he is always wanted all round the	112:101,30P  !
5P	country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice	112:101,31P  !
5P	any where. But then, there is not so clever a man any where."	112:101,32P  !
5P	"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question	112:101,38P  !
5P	or two to ask him about myself of some consequence.	112:102, 1P  !
5P	And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him	112:102, 2P  !
5P	look at little Bella's throat."	112:102, 3P  !
5P	"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should	112:102,10P  !
5P	have been of use to her~ and if I had known you	112:102,11P  !

5P	to~~"	112:102,13P  !
5A	"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs% and Miss Bates,"	112:102,14A  !
5A	"I have not heard one inquiry after	112:102,15A  !
5A	them."	112:102,16A  !
5P	"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor	112:102,24P  !
5P	Mrs% Bates had a bad cold about a month ago."	112:102,25P  !
5P	"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but	112:102,30P  !
5P	not to the degree you mention. Perry says that colds	112:102,31P  !
5P	have been very general, but not so heavy as he has very	112:102,32P  !
5P	often known them in November. Perry does not call it	112:102,33P  !
5P	altogether a sickly season."	112:102,34P  !
5P	"Ah| my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London	112:102,37P  !
5P	it is always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London,	112:102,38P  !
5P	nobody can be. It is a dreadful thing to have you forced	112:103, 1P  !
5P	to live there|~ so far off|~ and the air so bad|"	112:103, 2P  !
5P	"Ah| my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make	112:103,13P  !
5P	the best of it~ but after you have been a week at Hartfield,	112:103,14P  !
5P	you are all of you different creatures; you do not	112:103,15P  !
5P	look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think you	112:103,16P  !
5P	are any of you looking well at present."	112:103,17P  !
5P	"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you.	112:103,30P  !
5P	I think Mr% John Knightley very far from looking well."	112:103,31P  !
5A	"I do not thoroughly understand what you were telling	112:104, 5A  !
5A	your brother,"	112:104, 6A  !
5A	"about your friend Mr% Graham's	112:104, 6A  !
5A	intending to have a bailiff from Scotland, to	112:104, 7A  !
5A	look after his new estate. But will it answer? Will not	112:104, 8A  !
5A	the old prejudice be too strong?"	112:104, 9A  !
5P	"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such	112:104,27P  !
5P	another pretty kind of young person. You will like	112:104,28P  !
5P	Harriet. Emma could not have a better companion than	112:104,29P  !
5P	Harriet."	112:104,30P  !
5P	"Ah|"	112:105,12P  !
5P	"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea	112:105,21P  !
5P	this autumn, instead of coming here."	112:105,22P  !
5P	"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better	112:105,25P  !
5P	not have been to South End. South End is an unhealthy	112:105,26P  !
5P	place. Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon	112:105,27P  !
5P	South End."	112:105,28P  !
5P	"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you	112:105,37P  !
5P	went any where.~ Perry was a week at Cromer once, and	112:105,38P  !
5P	he holds it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places.	112:106, 1P  !
5P	A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by what	112:106, 2P  !
5P	I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite	112:106, 3P  !
5P	away from the sea~ a quarter of a mile off~ very comfortable.	112:106, 4P  !
5P	You should have consulted Perry."	112:106, 5P  !
5P	"Ah| my dear," as Perry says, "where health is at	112:106, 9P  !
5P	stake, nothing else should be considered;" and if one is	112:106,10P  !
5P	to travel, there is not much to chuse between forty miles	112:106,11P  !
5P	and an hundred.~ Better not move at all, better stay in	112:106,12P  !
5P	London altogether than travel forty miles to get into	112:106,13P  !
5P	a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to	112:106,14P  !
5P	him a very ill-judged measure."	112:106,15P  !
5B	"True, true,"	112:106,32B  !
5B	"very true. That's a consideration indeed.~	112:106,33B  !
5B	But John, as to what I was telling you of my idea	112:106,34B  !
5B	of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the	112:106,35B  !
5B	right that it may not cut through the home meadows,	112:106,36B  !
5B	I cannot conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt it,	112:106,37B  !
5B	if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury	112:106,38B  !
5B	people, but if you call to mind exactly the present line	112:107, 1B  !
5B	of the path. . . . The only way of proving it, however, will	112:107, 2B  !
5B	be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey	112:107, 3B  !
5B	to-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them	112:107, 4B  !
5B	over, and you shall give me your opinion."	112:107, 5B  !
5A	"a throat very much inflamed, with	113:109,28A  !
5A	a great deal of heat about her, a quick low pulse, &c% and	113:109,29A  !
5A	she was sorry to find from Mrs% Goddard that Harriet	113:109,30A  !
5A	was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed	113:109,31A  !
5A	her with them."~	113:109,32A  !
5A	"It is so cold, so very cold~ and looks and feels so very	113:110, 8A  !
5A	much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with	113:110, 9A  !
5A	any other party, I should really try not to go out to-day~	113:110,10A  !
5A	and dissuade my father from venturing; but as he has	113:110,11A  !
5A	made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the cold	113:110,12A  !
5A	himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be	113:110,13A  !
5A	so great a disappointment to Mr% and Mrs% Weston. But	113:110,14A  !
5A	upon my word, Mr% Elton, in your case, I should certainly	113:110,15A  !
5A	excuse myself. You appear to me a little hoarse already,	113:110,16A  !
5A	and when you consider what demand of voice and what	113:110,17A  !
5A	fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more	113:110,18A  !
5A	than common prudence to stay at home and take care of	113:110,19A  !
5A	yourself to-night."	113:110,20A  !
5A	"You do quite right,"	113:110,33A  !
5A	"We will make your	113:110,33A  !
5A	apologies to Mr% and Mrs% Weston."	113:110,34A  !
5A	"Mr% Elton's manners are not perfect,"	113:111,36A  !
5A	"but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook,	113:111,37A  !
5A	and one does overlook a great deal. Where a man does	113:111,38A  !
5A	his best with only moderate powers, he will have the	113:112, 1A  !
5A	advantage over negligent superiority.  There is such perfect	113:112, 2A  !
5A	good temper and good will in Mr% Elton as one cannot	113:112, 3A  !

5A	"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.	113:112,20A  !

5A	"\My\ report from Mrs% Goddard's,"	113:114,15A  !

5A	I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold	113:114,29A  !
5A	indeed. Mr% Perry has been with her, as you probably	113:114,30A  !

5N	"my son,"	114:118,30N  !
5N	"We want only two more to be just the right number.	114:119,26N  !
5N	I should like to see two more here,~ your pretty little	114:119,27N  !
5N	friend, Miss Smith, and my son~ and then I should say	114:119,28N  !
5N	we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me	114:119,29N  !
5N	telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting	114:119,30N  !
5N	Frank? I had a letter from him this morning, and	114:119,31N  !
5N	he will be with us within a fortnight."	114:119,32N  !
5N	"He has been wanting to come to us,"	114:119,36N  !
5N	"ever since September: every letter has	114:119,37N  !
5N	been full of it; but he cannot command his own time.	114:119,38N  !
5N	He has those to please who must be pleased, and who	114:120, 1N  !
5N	(between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by	114:120, 2N  !
5N	a good many sacrifices. But now I have no doubt of	114:120, 3N  !
5N	seeing him here about the second week in January."	114:120, 4N  !
5A	"What a very great pleasure it will be to you| and	114:120, 5A  !
5A	Mrs% Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that	114:120, 6A  !
5A	she must be almost as happy as yourself."	114:120, 7A  !
5N	"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there	114:120, 8N  !
5N	will be another put-off. She does not depend upon his	114:120, 9N  !
5N	coming so much as I do: but she does not know the	114:120,10N  !
5N	parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is~(but this is	114:120,11N  !
5N	quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of	114:120,12N  !
5N	it in the other room. There are secrets in all families, you	114:120,13N  !
5N	know)~ The case is, that a party of friends are invited to	114:120,14N  !
5N	pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's	114:120,15N  !
5N	coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not	114:120,16N  !
5N	put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it	114:120,17N  !
5N	is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at	114:120,18N  !
5N	Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is	114:120,19N  !
5N	thought necessary to invite them once in two or three	114:120,20N  !
5N	years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.	114:120,21N  !
5N	I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as	114:120,22N  !
5N	confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of	114:120,23N  !
5N	January, as I am of being here myself: but your good	114:120,24N  !
5N	friend there	114:120,25N  !
5N	has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to	114:120,26N  !
5N	them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their	114:120,27N  !
5N	effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing."	114:120,28N  !
5A	"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the	114:120,29A  !
5A	case,"	114:120,30A  !
5A	"but am disposed to side with you,	114:120,30A  !
5A	Mr% Weston. If you think he will come, I shall think so	114:120,31A  !
5A	too; for you know Enscombe."	114:120,32A  !
5N	"Yes~ I have some right to that knowledge; though	114:120,33N  !
5N	I have never been at the place in my life.~ She is an odd	114:120,34N  !
5N	woman|~ But I never allow myself to speak ill of her, on	114:120,35N  !
5N	Frank's account; for I do believe her to be very fond of	114:120,36N  !
5N	him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond	114:120,37N  !
5N	of any body, except herself: but she has always been	114:120,38N  !
5N	kind to him (in her way ~ allowing for little whims and	114:121, 1N  !
5N	caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she likes).	114:121, 2N  !
5N	And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he	114:121, 3N  !
5N	should excite such an affection; for, though I would not	114:121, 4N  !
5N	say it to any body else, she has no more heart than	114:121, 5N  !
5N	a stone to people in general; and the devil of a	114:121, 6N  !
5N	temper."	114:121, 7N  !
5O	"for I cannot depend	114:121,14O  !
5O	upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as Mr% Weston.	114:121,15O  !
5O	I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing.	114:121,16O  !
5O	Mr% Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how	114:121,17O  !
5O	the matter stands."	114:121,18O  !
5A	"Yes~ it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour	114:121,19A  !
5A	of Mrs% Churchill, which I imagine to be the	114:121,20A  !
5A	most certain thing in the world."	114:121,21A  !
5O	"My Emma|"	114:121,22O  !
5O	"what	114:121,22O  !
5O	is the certainty of caprice?"	114:121,23O  !
5O	"You must know,	114:121,24O  !
5O	my dear Mrs% Knightley, that we are by no means so sure	114:121,25O  !
5O	of seeing Mr% Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father	114:121,26O  !
5O	thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and	114:121,27O  !
5O	pleasure; in short, upon her temper. To you~ to my	114:121,28O  !
5O	two daughters, I may venture on the truth. Mrs% Churchill	114:121,29O  !
5O	rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman;	114:121,30O  !
5O	and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to	114:121,31O  !
5O	spare him."	114:121,32O  !
5A	"And so you do not consider this visit from your son	114:122,18A  !
5A	as by any means certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction	114:122,19A  !
5A	must be unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and	114:122,20A  !
5A	the sooner it could be over, the better."	114:122,21A  !
5O	"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive	114:122,22O  !
5O	of other delays. Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are	114:122,23O  !
5O	put off, I am still afraid that some excuse may be found	114:122,24O  !
5O	for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine any	114:122,25O  !
5O	reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish	114:122,26O  !
5O	on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is	114:122,27O  !
5O	jealousy. They are jealous even of his regard for his	114:122,28O  !
5O	father. In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming,	114:122,29O  !
5O	and I wish Mr% Weston were less sanguine."	114:122,30O  !
5A	"He ought to come,"	114:122,31A  !
5A	"If he could stay	114:122,31A  !
5A	only a couple of days, he ought to come; and one can	114:122,32A  !
5A	hardly conceive a young man's not having it in his power	114:122,33A  !
5A	to do as much as that. A young \woman\, if she fall into	114:122,34A  !
5A	bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance from	114:122,35A  !
5A	those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend	114:122,36A  !
5A	a young \man's\ being under such restraint, as not be to	114:122,37A  !
5A	able to spend a week with his father, if he likes it."	114:122,38A  !
5O	"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways	114:123, 1O  !
5O	of the family, before one decides upon what he can do,"	114:123, 2O  !
5O	"One ought to use the same caution,	114:123, 3O  !
5O	perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual	114:123, 4O  !
5O	of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly	114:123, 5O  !
5O	must not be judged by general rules: \she\ is so very	114:123, 6O  !
5O	unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her."	114:123, 7O  !
5A	"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great	114:123, 8A  !
5A	a favourite. Now, according to my idea of Mrs% Churchill,	114:123, 9A  !
5A	it would be most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice	114:123,10A  !
5A	for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every thing,	114:123,11A  !
5A	while she exercises incessant caprice towards \him\,	114:123,12A  !
5A	she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to	114:123,13A  !
5A	whom she owes nothing at all."	114:123,14A  !
5O	"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet	114:123,15O  !
5O	temper, to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for	114:123,16O  !
5O	it: you must let it go its own way. I have no doubt of	114:123,17O  !
5O	his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may	114:123,18O  !
5O	be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand \when\	114:123,19O  !
5O	it will be."	114:123,20O  !
5A	"I shall not be	114:123,21A  !
5A	satisfied, unless he comes."	114:123,22A  !
5O	"He may have a great deal of influence on some	114:123,23O  !
5O	points,"	114:123,24O  !
5O	"and on others, very	114:123,24O  !
5O	little: and among those, on which she is beyond his reach,	114:123,25O  !
5O	it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his	114:123,26O  !
5O	coming away from them to visit us."	114:123,27O  !
5P	"What is to be done, my dear Emma?~ what is to be	115:126,36P  !
5P	done?"	115:126,37P  !

5A	"Yes, do."	115:128,19A  !
5P	"He was afraid they should have a very	115:128,31P  !
5P	bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it.	115:128,32P  !
5P	And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.	115:128,33P  !
5P	He did not know what they had best do. They must	115:128,34P  !

5A	no more of this to \me\, if you please."	115:130, 4A  !
5A	"Mr% Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct|	115:130, 9A  !

5A	yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of Harriet,	115:130,11A  !
5A	in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no	115:130,12A  !
5A	more, and I will endeavour to forget it."	115:130,13A  !
5A	"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You	115:130,25A  !
5A	have made yourself too clear. Mr% Elton, my astonishment	115:130,26A  !
5A	is much beyond any thing I can express. After such	115:130,27A  !
5A	behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to	115:130,28A  !
5A	Miss Smith~ such attentions as I have been in the daily	115:130,29A  !
5A	habit of observing~ to be addressing me in this manner~	115:130,30A  !
5A	this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had	115:130,31A  !
5A	not supposed possible| Believe me, sir, I am far, very	115:130,32A  !
5A	far, from gratified in being the object of such professions."	115:130,33A  !
5A	"No, sir,"	115:131,23A  !
5A	"it confesses no such thing.	115:131,23A  !
5A	So far from having long understood you, I have been in	115:131,24A  !
5A	a most complete error with respect to your views, till this	115:131,25A  !
5A	moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you should	115:131,26A  !
5A	have been giving way to any feelings~~ Nothing could	115:131,27A  !
5A	be farther from my wishes~ your attachment to my friend	115:131,28A  !
5A	Harriet~ your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave	115:131,29A  !
5A	me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing	115:131,30A  !
5A	you success: but had I supposed that she were not your	115:131,31A  !
5A	attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought	115:131,32A  !
5A	you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am	115:131,33A  !
5A	I to believe that you have never sought to recommend	115:131,34A  !
5A	yourself particularly to Miss Smith?~ that you have	115:131,35A  !
5A	never thought seriously of her?"	115:131,36A  !
5A	"Encouragement|~ I give you encouragement|~ sir,	115:132,10A  !
5A	you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it. I have	115:132,11A  !
5A	seen you only as the admirer of my friend. In no other	115:132,12A  !
5A	light could you have been more to me than a common	115:132,13A  !
5A	acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well	115:132,14A  !
5A	that the mistake ends where it does. Had the same	115:132,15A  !
5A	behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have been led	115:132,16A  !
5A	into a misconception of your views; not being aware,	115:132,17A  !
5A	probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality	115:132,18A  !
5A	which you are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment	115:132,19A  !
5A	is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no	115:132,20A  !
5A	thoughts of matrimony at present."	115:132,21A  !
5A	"Here have I,"	116:137, 7A  !
5A	"actually talked poor Harriet	116:137, 7A  !
5A	into being very much attached to this man. She might	116:137, 8A  !
5A	never have thought of him but for me; and certainly	116:137, 9A  !
5A	never would have thought of him with hope, if I had not	116:137,10A  !
5A	assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and	116:137,11A  !
5A	humble as I used to think him. Oh| that I had been	116:137,12A  !
5A	satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin.	116:137,13A  !
5A	There I was quite right. That was well done of me; but	116:137,14A  !
5A	there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and	116:137,15A  !
5A	chance. I was introducing her into good company, and	116:137,16A  !
5A	giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth	116:137,17A  !
5A	having; I ought not to have attempted more. But now,	116:137,18A  !
5A	poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time. I have been	116:137,19A  !
5A	but half a friend to her; and if she were \not\ to feel this	116:137,20A  !
5A	disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an	116:137,21A  !
5A	idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;	116:137,22A  !
5A	~ William Coxe~ Oh| no, I could not endure William Coxe~	116:137,23A  !
5A	a pert young lawyer."	116:137,24A  !
5P	"Ah| Mr% Knightley, why do not you stay at home	116:139, 4P  !
5P	like poor Mr% Elton?"	116:139, 5P  !
5E	"very great mortification and	118:144, 4E  !
5E	regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of	118:144, 5E  !
5E	coming to Randalls at no distant period."	118:144, 6E  !
5B	"The Churchills are very likely in fault,"	118:145,15B  !
5B	"but I dare say he might come if he	118:145,16B  !
5B	would."	118:145,17B  !
5A	"I do not know why you should say so. He wishes	118:145,18A  !
5A	exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not	118:145,19A  !
5A	spare him."	118:145,20A  !
5B	"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming,	118:145,21B  !
5B	if he made a point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to	118:145,22B  !
5B	believe it without proof."	118:145,23B  !
5A	"How odd you are| What has Mr% Frank Churchill done,	118:145,24A  !
5A	to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?"	118:145,25A  !
5B	"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature,	118:145,26B  !
5B	in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his	118:145,27B  !
5B	connections, and to care very little for any thing but his	118:145,28B  !
5B	own pleasure, from living with those who have always set	118:145,29B  !
5B	him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural	118:145,30B  !
5B	than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by	118:145,31B  !
5B	those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be	118:145,32B  !
5B	proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If Frank Churchill had	118:145,33B  !
5B	wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it	118:145,34B  !
5B	between September and January. A man at his age~	118:145,35B  !
5B	what is he?~ three or four-and-twenty~ cannot be without	118:145,36B  !
5B	the means of doing as much as that. It is impossible."	118:145,37B  !
5A	"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have	118:145,38A  !
5A	always been your own master. You are the worst judge	118:146, 1A  !
5A	in the world, Mr% Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence.	118:146, 2A  !
5A	You do not know what it is to have tempers to	118:146, 3A  !
5A	manage."	118:146, 4A  !
5B	"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty	118:146, 5B  !
5B	should not have liberty of mind or limb to	118:146, 6B  !
5B	that amount. He cannot want money~ he cannot want	118:146, 7B  !
5B	leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so much	118:146, 8B  !
5B	of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest	118:146, 9B  !
5B	haunts in the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some	118:146,10B  !
5B	watering-place or other. A little while ago, he was at	118:146,11B  !
5B	Weymouth. This proves that he can leave the Churchills	118:146,12B  !
5A	"Yes, sometimes he can."	118:146,13A  !
5B	"And those times are, whenever he thinks it worth his	118:146,14B  !
5B	while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."	118:146,15B  !
5A	"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct,	118:146,16A  !
5A	without an intimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody,	118:146,17A  !
5A	who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what	118:146,18A  !
5A	the difficulties of any individual of that family may be.	118:146,19A  !
5A	We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with	118:146,20A  !
5A	Mrs% Churchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon	118:146,21A  !
5A	what her nephew can do. He may, at times, be able to	118:146,22A  !
5A	do a great deal more than he can at others."	118:146,23A  !
5B	"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always	118:146,24B  !
5B	do, if he chuses, and that is, his duty; not by mano euvring	118:146,25B  !
5B	and finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Frank Churchill's	118:146,26B  !
5B	duty to pay this attention to his father. He	118:146,27B  !
5B	knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if	118:146,28B  !
5B	he wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt	118:146,29B  !
5B	rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to	118:146,30B  !
5B	Mrs% Churchill~ ""Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will	118:146,31B  !
5B	always find me ready to make to your convenience; but	118:146,32B  !
5B	I must go and see my father immediately. I know he	118:146,33B  !
5B	would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to	118:146,34B  !
5B	him on the present occasion. I shall, therefore, set off	118:146,35B  !
5B	to-morrow.""~ If he would say so to her at once, in the	118:146,36B  !
5B	tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no	118:146,37B  !
5B	opposition made to his going."	118:146,38B  !
5A	"No,"	118:147, 1A  !
5A	"but perhaps there	118:147, 1A  !
5A	might be some made to his coming back again. Such	118:147, 2A  !
5A	language for a young man entirely dependent, to use|~	118:147, 3A  !
5A	Nobody but you, Mr% Knightley, would imagine it possible.	118:147, 4A  !
5A	But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations	118:147, 5A  !
5A	directly opposite to your own. Mr% Frank Churchill to	118:147, 6A  !
5A	be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt,	118:147, 7A  !
5A	who have brought him up, and are to provide for him|~	118:147, 8A  !
5A	Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and	118:147, 9A  !
5A	speaking as loud as he could|~ How can you imagine such	118:147,10A  !
5A	conduct practicable?"	118:147,11A  !
5B	"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find	118:147,12B  !
5B	no difficulty in it. He would feel himself in the right;	118:147,13B  !
5B	and the declaration~ made, of course, as a man of sense	118:147,14B  !
5B	would make it, in a proper manner~ would do him more	118:147,15B  !
5B	good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the	118:147,16B  !
5B	people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and	118:147,17B  !
5B	expedients can ever do. Respect would be added to	118:147,18B  !
5B	affection. They would feel that they could trust him;	118:147,19B  !
5B	that the nephew, who had done rightly by his father,	118:147,20B  !
5B	would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he	118:147,21B  !
5B	does, as well as all the world must know, that he ought	118:147,22B  !
5B	to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting	118:147,23B  !
5B	their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking	118:147,24B  !
5B	the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect	118:147,25B  !
5B	for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act	118:147,26B  !
5B	in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly,	118:147,27B  !
5B	their little minds would bend to his."	118:147,28B  !
5A	"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending	118:147,29A  !
5A	little minds; but where little minds belong to rich people	118:147,30A  !
5A	in authority, I think they have a knack of swelling out,	118:147,31A  !
5A	till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones. I can	118:147,32A  !
5A	imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr% Knightley, were to be	118:147,33A  !
5A	transported and placed all at once in Mr% Frank Churchill's	118:147,34A  !
5A	situation, you would be able to say and do just what you	118:147,35A  !
5A	have been recommending for him; and it might have	118:147,36A  !
5A	a very good effect. The Churchills might not have a word	118:147,37A  !
5A	to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of	118:147,38A  !
5A	early obedience and long observance to break through.	118:148, 1A  !
5A	To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth	118:148, 2A  !
5A	at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims	118:148, 3A  !
5A	on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as	118:148, 4A  !
5A	strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have,	118:148, 5A  !
5A	without being so equal under particular circumstances	118:148, 6A  !
5A	to act up to it."	118:148, 7A  !
5B	"Then, it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed	118:148, 8B  !
5B	to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal	118:148, 9B  !
5B	conviction."	118:148,10B  !
5A	"Oh| the difference of situation and habit| I wish	118:148,11A  !
5A	you would try to understand what an amiable young man	118:148,12A  !
5A	may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as	118:148,13A  !
5A	child and boy he has been looking up to all his life."	118:148,14A  !
5B	"Your amiable young man is a very weak young man,	118:148,15B  !
5B	if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution	118:148,16B  !
5B	to do right against the will of others. It ought to	118:148,17B  !
5B	have been an habit with him by this time, of following his	118:148,18B  !
5B	duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for	118:148,19B  !
5B	the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became	118:148,20B  !
5B	rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off	118:148,21B  !
5B	all that was unworthy in their authority. He ought to	118:148,22B  !
5B	have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him	118:148,23B  !
5B	slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there would	118:148,24B  !
5B	have been no difficulty now."	118:148,25B  !
5A	"We shall never agree about him,"	118:148,26A  !
5A	"but	118:148,26A  !
5A	that is nothing extraordinary. I have not the least idea	118:148,27A  !
5A	of his being a weak young man: I feel sure that he is not.	118:148,28A  !
5A	Mr% Weston would not be blind to folly, though in his own	118:148,29A  !
5A	son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding, complying,	118:148,30A  !
5A	mild disposition than would suit your notions of	118:148,31A  !
5A	man's perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may	118:148,32A  !
5A	cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him	118:148,33A  !
5A	many others."	118:148,34A  !
5B	"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought	118:148,35B  !
5B	to move, and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and	118:148,36B  !
5B	fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for	118:148,37B  !
5B	it. He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter, full	118:148,38B  !
5B	of professions and falsehoods, and persuade himself that	118:149, 1B  !
5B	he has hit upon the very best method in the world of	118:149, 2B  !
5B	preserving peace at home and preventing his father's	118:149, 3B  !
5B	having any right to complain. His letters disgust	118:149, 4B  !
5B	me."	118:149, 5B  !
5A	"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy	118:149, 6A  !
5A	every body else."	118:149, 7A  !
5B	"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs% Weston. They	118:149, 8B  !
5B	hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick	118:149, 9B  !
5B	feelings: standing in a mother's place, but without	118:149,10B  !
5B	a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her account	118:149,11B  !
5B	that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must	118:149,12B  !
5B	doubly feel the omission. Had she been a person of	118:149,13B  !
5B	consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and	118:149,14B  !
5B	it would not have signified whether he did or no. Can you	118:149,15B  !
5B	think your friend behind-hand in these sort of considerations?	118:149,16B  !
5B	Do you suppose she does not often say all this to	118:149,17B  !
5B	herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be	118:149,18B  !
5B	amiable only in French, not in English. He may be very	118:149,19B  !
5B	""aimable,"" have very good manners, and be very agreeable;	118:149,20B  !
5B	but he can have no English delicacy towards the	118:149,21B  !
5B	feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about	118:149,22B  !
5B	him."	118:149,23B  !
5A	"You seem determined to think ill of him."	118:149,24A  !
5B	"Me|~ not at all,"	118:149,25B  !
5B	"I do not want to think ill of him. I should	118:149,26B  !
5B	be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man;	118:149,27B  !
5B	but I hear of none, except what are merely personal; that	118:149,28B  !
5B	he is well grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible	118:149,29B  !
5B	manners."	118:149,30B  !
5A	"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he	118:149,31A  !
5A	will be a treasure at Highbury. We do not often look	118:149,32A  !
5A	upon fine young men, well-bred and agreeable. We must	118:149,33A  !
5A	not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain.	118:149,34A  !
5A	Cannot you imagine, Mr% Knightley, what a \sensation\ his	118:149,35A  !
5A	coming will produce? There will be but one subject	118:149,36A  !
5A	throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but	118:149,37A  !
5A	one interest~ one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr% Frank Churchill;	118:149,38A  !
5A	we shall think and speak of nobody	118:150, 1A  !
5A	else."	118:150, 2A  !
5B	"You will excuse my being so much overpowered. If	118:150, 3B  !
5B	I find him conversible, I shall be glad of his acquaintance;	118:150, 4B  !
5B	but if he is only a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy	118:150, 5B  !
5B	much of my time or thoughts."	118:150, 6B  !
5A	"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation	118:150, 7A  !
5A	to the taste of every body, and has the power as well as	118:150, 8A  !
5A	the wish of being universally agreeable. To you, he will	118:150, 9A  !
5A	talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so on	118:150,10A  !
5A	to every body, having that general information on all	118:150,11A  !
5A	subjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take	118:150,12A  !
5A	the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak	118:150,13A  !
5A	extremely well on each; that is my idea of him."	118:150,14A  !
5B	"And mine,"	118:150,15B  !
5B	"is, that if	118:150,15B  !

5B	own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around,	118:150,21B  !
5B	that he may make all appear like fools compared with	118:150,22B  !
5B	himself| My dear Emma, your own good sense could	118:150,23B  !
5B	not endure such a puppy when it came to the point."	118:150,24B  !
5A	"I will say no more about him,"	118:150,25A  !
5A	"you	118:150,25A  !
5A	turn every thing to evil. We are both prejudiced; you	118:150,26A  !
5A	against, I for him; and we have no chance of agreeing	118:150,27A  !
5A	till he is really here."	118:150,28A  !
5B	"Prejudiced| I am not prejudiced."	118:150,29B  !
5A	"But I am very much, and without being at all	118:150,30A  !
5A	ashamed of it. My love for Mr% and Mrs% Weston gives me	118:150,31A  !
5A	a decided prejudice in his favour."	118:150,32A  !
5B	"He is a person I never think of from one month's end	118:150,33B  !
5B	to another,"	118:150,34B  !
5M	"Mr% Elton is so good to the poor|"	201:155, 9M  !
5D	"Oh| yes~ Mr% Elton, I understood~ certainly as to	201:156,34D  !
5D	dancing~ Mrs% Cole was telling me that dancing at the	201:156,35D  !
5D	rooms at Bath was~~ Mrs% Cole was so kind as to sit some	201:156,36D  !
5D	time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she came in,	201:156,37D  !
5D	she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great	201:156,38D  !
5D	a favourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs% Cole	201:157, 1D  !
5D	does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and	201:157, 2D  !
5D	I must say that Jane deserves it as much as anybody can.	201:157, 3D  !
5D	And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying,	201:157, 4D  !
5D	and when I immediately	201:157, 6D  !
5D	said, ""But indeed we have, we had a letter this very	201:157, 7D  !
5D	morning,"" I do not know that I ever saw anybody more	201:157, 8D  !
5D	surprized.	201:157, 9D  !
5D	said she;	201:157, 9D  !
5A	"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am	201:157,14A  !
5A	extremely happy. I hope she is well?"	201:157,15A  !
5D	"Thank you. You are so kind|"	201:157,16D  !
5D	"Oh|	201:157,17D  !
5D	here it is. I was sure it could not be far off; but I had	201:157,18D  !
5D	put my huswife upon it, you see, without being aware,	201:157,19D  !
5D	and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very	201:157,20D  !
5D	lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was	201:157,21D  !
5D	reading it to Mrs% Cole, and since she went away, I was	201:157,22D  !
5D	reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to	201:157,23D  !
5D	her~ a letter from Jane~ that she can never hear it often	201:157,24D  !
5D	enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is,	201:157,25D  !
5D	only just under my huswife~ and since you are so kind as	201:157,26D  !
5D	to wish to hear what she says;~ but, first of all, I really	201:157,27D  !
5D	must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short	201:157,28D  !
5D	a letter~ only two pages you see~ hardly two~ and in	201:157,29D  !
5D	general she fills the whole paper and crosses half. My	201:157,30D  !
5D	mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.	201:157,31D  !
5D	She often says, when the letter is first opened,	201:157,32D  !
5D	don't you, ma'am?~ And then I tell	201:157,34D  !
5D	her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself,	201:157,35D  !
5D	if she had nobody to do it for her~ every word of it ~ I am	201:157,36D  !
5D	sure she would pore over it till she had made out every	201:157,37D  !
5D	word. And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not so	201:157,38D  !
5D	good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank	201:158, 1D  !
5D	God| with the help of spectacles. It is such a blessing|	201:158, 2D  !
5D	My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often	201:158, 3D  !
5D	says, when she is here,	201:158, 4D  !
5D	"You are extremely kind,"	201:158,11D  !
5D	"you who are such a judge, and write so	201:158,12D  !
5D	beautifully yourself. I am sure there is nobody's praise	201:158,13D  !
5D	that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's.	201:158,14D  !
5D	My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.	201:158,15D  !
5D	Ma'am,"	201:158,16D  !
5D	"do you hear what Miss Woodhouse	201:158,16D  !
5D	is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?"	201:158,17D  !
5D	"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see~ just	201:158,26D  !
5D	nothing at all. By only raising my voice, and saying	201:158,27D  !
5D	anything two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but	201:158,28D  !
5D	then she is used to my voice. But it is very remarkable	201:158,29D  !
5D	that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.	201:158,30D  !
5D	Jane speaks so distinct| However, she will not find her	201:158,31D  !
5D	grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago;	201:158,32D  !
5D	which is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life~	201:158,33D  !
5D	and it really is full two years, you know, since she was	201:158,34D  !
5D	here. We never were so long without seeing her before,	201:158,35D  !
5D	and as I was telling Mrs% Cole, we shall hardly know how	201:158,36D  !
5D	to make enough of her now."	201:158,37D  !
5A	"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"	201:158,38A  !
5D	"Oh, yes; next week."	201:159, 1D  !
5A	"Indeed|~ That must be a very great pleasure."	201:159, 2A  !
5D	"Thank you, You are very kind. Yes, next week.	201:159, 3D  !
5D	Every body is so surprized; and every body says the same	201:159, 4D  !
5D	obliging things. I am sure she will be as happy to see her	201:159, 5D  !
5D	friends at Highbury, as they can be to see her. Yes,	201:159, 6D  !
5D	Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because	201:159, 7D  !
5D	Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one	201:159, 8D  !
5D	of those days. So very good of them to send her the whole	201:159, 9D  !
5D	way| But they always do, you know. Oh, yes, Friday	201:159,10D  !
5D	or Saturday next. That is what she writes about. That	201:159,11D  !
5D	is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for	201:159,12D  !
5D	in the common course, we should not have heard from	201:159,13D  !
5D	her before next Tuesday or Wednesday."	201:159,14D  !
5A	"Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little	201:159,15A  !
5A	chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."	201:159,16A  !
5D	"So obliging of you| No, we should not have heard,	201:159,17D  !
5D	if it had not been for this particular circumstance, of her	201:159,18D  !
5D	being to come here so soon. My mother is so delighted|~	201:159,19D  !
5D	for she is to be three months with us at least. Three	201:159,20D  !
5D	months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the	201:159,21D  !
5D	pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the	201:159,22D  !
5D	Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs% Dixon has persuaded	201:159,23D  !
5D	her father and mother to come over and see her directly.	201:159,24D  !
5D	They had not intended to go over till the summer, but	201:159,25D  !
5D	she is so impatient to see them again~ for till she married,	201:159,26D  !
5D	last October, she was never away from them so much as	201:159,27D  !
5D	a week, which must make it very strange to be in different	201:159,28D  !
5D	kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different	201:159,29D  !
5D	countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her	201:159,30D  !
5D	mother~ or her father, I declare I do not know which it	201:159,31D  !
5D	was, but we shall see presently in Jane's letter~ wrote in	201:159,32D  !
5D	Mr% Dixon's name as well as her own, to press their coming	201:159,33D  !
5D	over directly, and they would give them the meeting in	201:159,34D  !
5D	Dublin, and take them back to their country-seat, Balycraig,	201:159,35D  !
5D	a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great	201:159,36D  !
5D	deal of its beauty; from Mr% Dixon I mean~ I do not know	201:159,37D  !
5D	that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it	201:159,38D  !
5D	was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak	201:160, 1D  !
5D	of his own place while he was paying his addresses~ and	201:160, 2D  !
5D	as Jane used to be very often walking out with them~ for	201:160, 3D  !
5D	Colonel and Mrs% Campbell were very particular about	201:160, 4D  !
5D	their daughter's not walking out often with only Mr% Dixon,	201:160, 5D  !
5D	for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard	201:160, 6D  !
5D	everything he might be telling Miss Campbell about his	201:160, 7D  !
5D	own home in Ireland. And I think she wrote us word	201:160, 8D  !
5D	that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views	201:160, 9D  !
5D	that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming	201:160,10D  !
5D	young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go	201:160,11D  !
5D	to Ireland, from his account of things."	201:160,12D  !
5A	"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax	201:160,17A  !
5A	should be allowed to come to you at such a time. Considering	201:160,18A  !
5A	the very particular friendship between her and	201:160,19A  !
5A	Mrs% Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be	201:160,20A  !
5A	excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs% Campbell."	201:160,21A  !
5D	"Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we	201:160,22D  !
5D	have always been rather afraid of; for we should not have	201:160,23D  !
5D	liked to have her at such a distance from us, for months	201:160,24D  !
5D	together~ not able to come if anything was to happen.	201:160,25D  !
5D	But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They	201:160,26D  !
5D	want her (Mr% and Mrs% Dixon) excessively to come over	201:160,27D  !
5D	with Colonel and Mrs% Campbell; quite depend upon it;	201:160,28D  !
5D	nothing can be more kind or pressing than their \joint\	201:160,29D  !
5D	invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr% Dixon	201:160,30D  !
5D	does not seem in the least backward in any attention.	201:160,31D  !
5D	He is a most charming young man. Ever since the	201:160,32D  !
5D	service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were	201:160,33D  !
5D	out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden	201:160,34D  !
5D	whirling round of something or other among the sails,	201:160,35D  !
5D	would have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually	201:160,36D  !
5D	was all but gone, if he had not, with the greatest presence	201:160,37D  !
5D	of mind, caught hold of her habit~ (I can never think of it	201:160,38D  !
5D	without trembling|)~ But ever since we had the history	201:161, 1D  !
5D	of that day, I have been so fond of Mr% Dixon|"	201:161, 2D  !
5A	"But, in spite of all her friend's urgency, and her own	201:161, 3A  !
5A	wish of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the	201:161, 4A  !
5A	time to you and Mrs% Bates?"	201:161, 5A  !
5D	"Yes~ entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice;	201:161, 6D  !
5D	and Colonel and Mrs% Campbell think she does quite right,	201:161, 7D  !
5D	just what they should recommend; and indeed they particularly	201:161, 8D  !
5D	\wish\ her to try her native air, as she has not been	201:161, 9D  !
5D	quite so well as usual lately."	201:161,10D  !
5A	"I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely.	201:161,11A  !
5A	But Mrs% Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs% Dixon,	201:161,12A  !
5A	I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal	201:161,13A  !
5A	beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with	201:161,14A  !
5A	Miss Fairfax."	201:161,15A  !
5D	"Oh| no. You are very obliging to say such things~	201:161,16D  !
5D	but certainly not. There is no comparison between them.	201:161,17D  !
5D	Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain~ but extremely	201:161,18D  !
5D	elegant and amiable."	201:161,19D  !
5A	"Yes, that of course."	201:161,20A  !
5D	"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing| so long ago as	201:161,21D  !
5D	the 7th November, (as I am going to read to you,) and	201:161,22D  !
5D	has never been well since. A long time, is not it, for a cold	201:161,23D  !
5D	to hang upon her? She never mentioned it before, because	201:161,24D  !
5D	she would not alarm us. Just like her| so considerate|~	201:161,25D  !
5D	But however, she is so far from well, that her kind friends	201:161,26D  !
5D	the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an	201:161,27D  !
5D	air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt	201:161,28D  !
5D	that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure	201:161,29D  !
5D	her~ and it is certainly a great deal better that she should	201:161,30D  !
5D	come here, than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody	201:161,31D  !
5D	could nurse her, as we should do."	201:161,32D  !
5A	"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in	201:161,33A  !
5A	the world."	201:161,34A  !
5D	"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday,	201:161,35D  !
5D	and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead	201:161,36D  !
5D	the Monday following~ as you will find from Jane's letter.	201:161,37D  !
5D	So sudden|~ You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what	201:161,38D  !
5D	a flurry it has thrown me in| If it was not for the drawback	201:162, 1D  !
5D	of her illness~ but I am afraid we must expect to	201:162, 2D  !
5D	see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell	201:162, 3D  !
5D	you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that.	201:162, 4D  !
5D	I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to	201:162, 5D  !
5D	myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you	201:162, 6D  !
5D	know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress	201:162, 7D  !
5D	her. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I	201:162, 8D  !
5D	began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did	201:162, 9D  !
5D	I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst	201:162,10D  !
5D	out quite frightened with, ""Bless me| poor Jane is ill|""~	201:162,11D  !
5D	which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly,	201:162,12D  !
5D	and was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I	201:162,13D  !
5D	found it was not near so bad as I fancied at first; and I	201:162,14D  !
5D	make so light of it now to her, that she does not think much	201:162,15D  !
5D	about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my	201:162,16D  !
5D	guard| If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in	201:162,17D  !
5D	Mr% Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and	201:162,18D  !
5D	though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say	201:162,19D  !
5D	he would not mean to charge anything for attendance, we	201:162,20D  !
5D	could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and	201:162,21D  !
5D	family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time.	201:162,22D  !
5D	Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes	201:162,23D  !
5D	about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her	201:162,24D  !
5D	own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her."	201:162,25D  !
5A	"I am afraid we must be running away,"	201:162,26A  !
5A	"My father	201:162,27A  !
5A	will be expecting us. I had no intention, I thought I had	201:162,28A  !
5A	no power of staying more than five minutes, when I first	201:162,29A  !
5A	entered the house. I merely called, because I would not	201:162,30A  !
5A	pass the door without inquiring after Mrs% Bates; but I	201:162,31A  !
5A	have been so pleasantly detained| Now, however, we	201:162,32A  !
5A	must wish you and Mrs% Bates good morning."	201:162,33A  !
5A	"She certainly is handsome; she is	202:168,27A  !
5A	better than handsome|"	202:168,28A  !
5A	"Was he handsome?"~	202:169,28A  !
5A	"Was he agreeable?" ~	202:169,30A  !
5A	"Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man of	202:169,31A  !
5A	information?"~	202:169,32A  !
5B	"A very pleasant evening,"	203:170,12B  !
5B	"particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us	203:170,15B  !
5B	some very good music. I do not know a more luxurious	203:170,16B  !
5B	state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained	203:170,17B  !
5B	a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes	203:170,18B  !
5B	with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure	203:170,19B  !
5B	Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant,	203:170,20B  !
5B	Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad you made	203:170,21B  !
5B	her play so much, for having no instrument at her	203:170,22B  !
5B	grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."	203:170,23B  !
5A	"I am happy you approved,"	203:170,24A  !
5A	"but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to	203:170,25A  !
5A	guests at Hartfield."	203:170,26A  !
5P	"No, my dear,"	203:170,27P  !
5P	"\that\	203:170,27P  !
5P	I am sure you are not. There is nobody half so attentive	203:170,28P  !
5P	and civil as you are. If any thing, you are too attentive.	203:170,29P  !
5P	The muffin last night~ if it had been handed round once,	203:170,30P  !
5P	I think it would have been enough."	203:170,31P  !
5B	"No,"	203:170,32B  !
5B	"you are not often deficient; not often deficient either	203:170,33B  !
5B	in manner or comprehension. I think you understand	203:171, 1B  !
5B	me, therefore."	203:171, 2B  !
5A	"Miss Fairfax is reserved."	203:171, 4A  !
5B	"I always told you she was~ a little; but you will	203:171, 5B  !
5B	soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought	203:171, 6B  !
5B	to be overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence.	203:171, 7B  !
5B	what arises from discretion must be honoured."	203:171, 8B  !
5A	"You think her diffident. I do not see it."	203:171, 9A  !
5B	"My dear Emma,"	203:171,10B  !
5B	"you are not going to tell me, I hope,	203:171,11B  !
5B	that you had not a pleasant evening."	203:171,12B  !
5A	"Oh| no; I was pleased with my own perseverance	203:171,13A  !
5A	in asking questions, and amused to think how little	203:171,14A  !
5A	information I obtained."	203:171,15A  !
5B	"I am disappointed,"	203:171,16B  !
5P	"I hope every body had a pleasant evening,"	203:171,17P  !
5P	"I had. Once, I felt	203:171,18P  !
5P	the fire rather too much; but then I moved back my chair	203:171,19P  !
5P	a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. Miss Bates	203:171,20P  !
5P	was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always	203:171,21P  !
5P	is, though she speaks rather too quick. However, she	203:171,22P  !
5P	is very agreeable, and Mrs% Bates too, in a different way.	203:171,23P  !
5P	I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty	203:171,24P  !
5P	sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved	203:171,25P  !
5P	young lady indeed. She must have found the evening	203:171,26P  !
5P	agreeable, Mr% Knightley, because she had Emma."	203:171,27P  !
5B	"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax."	203:171,28B  !
5A	"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep	203:171,32A  !
5A	one's eyes from. I am always watching her to admire;	203:171,33A  !
5A	and I do pity her from my heart."	203:171,34A  !
5P	"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be	203:172, 1P  !
5P	so confined| a great pity indeed| and I have often	203:172, 2P  !
5P	wished~ but it is so little one can venture to do~ small,	203:172, 3P  !
5P	trifling presents, of any thing uncommon~ Now we have	203:172, 4P  !
5P	killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin	203:172, 5P  !
5P	or a leg; it is very small and delicate~ Hartfield pork is	203:172, 6P  !
5P	not like any other pork~ but still it is pork~ and, my	203:172, 7P  !
5P	dear Emma, unless one could be sure of their making it	203:172, 8P  !
5P	into steaks, nicely fried, as our's are fried, without the	203:172, 9P  !
5P	smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear	203:172,10P  !
5P	roast pork~ I think we had better send the leg~ do not	203:172,11P  !
5P	you think so, my dear?"	203:172,12P  !
5A	"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew	203:172,13A  !
5A	you would wish it. There will be the leg to be salted,	203:172,14A  !
5A	you know, which is so very nice, and the loin to be	203:172,15A  !
5A	dressed directly in any manner they like."	203:172,16A  !
5P	"That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought	203:172,17P  !
5P	of it before, but that was the best way. They must not	203:172,18P  !
5P	over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and	203:172,19P  !
5P	if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils our's,	203:172,20P  !
5P	and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a	203:172,21P  !
5P	little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome."	203:172,22P  !
5B	"Emma,"	203:172,23B  !
5B	"I have	203:172,23B  !
5B	a piece of news for you. You like news~ and I heard an	203:172,24B  !
5B	article in my way hither that I think will interest you."	203:172,25B  !
5A	"News| Oh| yes, I always like news. What is it?~	203:172,26A  !
5A	why do you smile so?~ where did you hear it?~ at	203:172,27A  !
5A	Randalls?"	203:172,28A  !
5B	"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,"	203:172,30B  !
5D	"Oh| my dear sir, how are you this morning? My	203:172,37D  !
5D	dear Miss Woodhouse~ I come quite overpowered. Such	203:172,38D  !
5D	a beautiful hind-quarter of pork| You are too bountiful|	203:173, 1D  !
5D	Have you heard the news? Mr% Elton is going to be	203:173, 2D  !
5D	married."	203:173, 3D  !
5B	"There is my news:~ I thought it would interest you,"	203:173, 7B  !
5D	"But where could \you\ hear it?"	203:173,10D  !
5D	"Where could you possibly hear it, Mr% Knightley?	203:173,11D  !
5D	For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs% Cole's	203:173,12D  !
5D	note~ no, it cannot be more than five~ or at least ten~	203:173,13D  !
5D	for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to	203:173,14D  !
5D	come out~ I was only gone down to speak to Patty again	203:173,15D  !
5D	about the pork~ Jane was standing in the passage~	203:173,16D  !
5D	were not you, Jane?~ for my mother was so afraid that	203:173,17D  !
5D	we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said	203:173,18D  !
5D	I would go down and see, and Jane said,	203:173,19D  !
5D	""Oh| my dear," said I~	203:173,21D  !
5D	well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins~ that's	203:173,22D  !
5D	all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr% Knightley,	203:173,23D  !
5D	how could you possibly have heard it? for the very	203:173,24D  !
5D	moment Mr% Cole told Mrs% Cole of it, she sat down and	203:173,25D  !
5D	wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins"~	203:173,26D  !
5B	"I was with Mr% Cole on business an hour and half	203:173,27B  !
5B	ago. He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in,	203:173,28B  !
5B	and handed it to me directly."	203:173,29B  !
5D	"Well| that is quite ~~ I suppose there never was	203:173,30D  !
5D	a piece of news more generally interesting. My dear sir,	203:173,31D  !
5D	you really are too bountiful. My mother desires her	203:173,32D  !
5D	very best compliments and regards, and a thousand	203:173,33D  !
5D	thanks, and says you really quite oppress her."	203:173,34D  !
5P	"We consider our Hartfield pork,"	203:173,35P  !
5P	"indeed it certainly is, so very superior to all	203:173,36P  !
5P	other pork, that Emma and I cannot have a greater	203:173,37P  !
5P	pleasure than"~	203:173,38P  !
5D	"Oh| my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are	203:174, 1D  !
5D	only too good to us. If ever there were people who,	203:174, 2D  !
5D	without having great wealth themselves, had every thing	203:174, 3D  !
5D	they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We may well say	203:174, 4D  !
5D	that ""our lot is cast in a goodly heritage."" Well, Mr% Knightley,	203:174, 5D  !
5D	and so you actually saw the letter; well"~	203:174, 6D  !
5B	"It was short, merely to announce~ but cheerful,	203:174, 7B  !
5B	exulting, of course."~	203:174, 8B  !
5B	"He had been so fortunate as to~ I forget the precise	203:174, 9B  !
5B	words~ one has no business to remember them. The	203:174,10B  !
5B	information was, as you state, that he was going to be	203:174,11B  !
5B	married to a Miss Hawkins. By his style, I should	203:174,12B  !
5B	imagine it just settled."	203:174,13B  !
5A	"Mr% Elton going to be married|"	203:174,14A  !
5A	"He will have everybody's	203:174,15A  !
5A	wishes for his happiness."	203:174,16A  !
5P	"He is very young to settle,"	203:174,17P  !
5P	"He had better not be in a hurry. He	203:174,18P  !
5P	seemed to me very well off as he was. We were always	203:174,19P  !
5P	glad to see him at Hartfield."	203:174,20P  !
5D	"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse|"	203:174,21D  !
5D	"my mother is so pleased|~ she	203:174,22D  !
5D	says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without	203:174,23D  !
5D	a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have	203:174,24D  !
5D	never seen Mr% Elton|~ no wonder that you have such	203:174,25D  !
5D	a curiosity to see him."	203:174,26D  !
5A	"Who shall answer that question?"	203:174,31A  !
5A	"My father would say ""yes,"" Mr% Knightley, ""no;"" and	203:174,32A  !
5A	Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium.	203:174,33A  !
5A	When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,	203:174,34A  !
5A	you will understand that Mr% Elton is the standard of	203:174,35A  !
5A	perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind."	203:174,36A  !
5D	"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the	203:174,37D  !
5D	very best young man~ But, my dear Jane, if you remember,	203:174,38D  !
5D	I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of	203:175, 1D  !
5D	Mr% Perry. Miss Hawkins,~ I dare say, an excellent	203:175, 2D  !
5D	young woman. His extreme attention to my mother~	203:175, 3D  !
5D	wanting her to sit in the vicarage-pew, that she might	203:175, 4D  !
5D	hear the better, for my mother is a little deaf, you know~	203:175, 5D  !
5D	it is not much, but she does not hear quite quick. Jane	203:175, 6D  !
5D	says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He fancied	203:175, 7D  !
5D	bathing might be good for it~ the warm bath~ but she	203:175, 8D  !
5D	says it did him no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you	203:175, 9D  !
5D	know, is quite our angel. And Mr% Dixon seems a very	203:175,10D  !
5D	charming young man, quite worthy of him. It is such	203:175,11D  !
5D	a happiness when good people get together~ and they	203:175,12D  !
5D	always do. Now, here will be Mr% Elton and Miss Hawkins;	203:175,13D  !
5D	and there are the Coles, such very good people; and the	203:175,14D  !
5D	Perrys~ I suppose there never was a happier or a better	203:175,15D  !
5D	couple than Mr% and Mrs% Perry. I say, sir,"	203:175,16D  !
5D	"I think there are few places with such	203:175,17D  !
5D	society as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed	203:175,18D  !
5D	in our neighbours.~ My dear sir, if there is one thing my	203:175,19D  !
5D	mother loves better than another, it is pork~ a roast loin	203:175,20D  !
5D	of pork"~	203:175,21D  !
5A	"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he	203:175,22A  !
5A	has been acquainted with her,"	203:175,23A  !
5A	"nothing	203:175,23A  !
5A	I suppose can be known. One feels that it cannot be	203:175,24A  !
5A	a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four	203:175,25A  !
5A	weeks."	203:175,26A  !
5A	"You are silent, Miss Fairfax~ but I hope you mean	203:175,29A  !
5A	to take an interest in this news. You, who have been	203:175,30A  !
5A	hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects, who	203:175,31A  !
5A	must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell's	203:175,32A  !
5A	account~ we shall not excuse your being indifferent	203:175,33A  !
5A	about Mr% Elton and Miss Hawkins."	203:175,34A  !
5D	"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe,	203:176, 1D  !
5D	Miss Woodhouse,"	203:176, 2D  !
5D	"four weeks yesterday.	203:176, 2D  !
5D	~ A Miss Hawkins~. Well, I had always rather fancied	203:176, 3D  !
5D	it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that I ever	203:176, 4D  !
5D	~ Mrs% Cole once whispered to me~ but I immediately	203:176, 5D  !
5D	said, ""No, Mr% Elton is a most worthy young man~	203:176, 6D  !
5D	but""~ In short, I do not think I am particularly	203:176, 7D  !
5D	quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it.	203:176, 8D  !
5D	What is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody	203:176, 9D  !
5D	could wonder if Mr% Elton should have aspired~~	203:176,10D  !
5D	Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly.	203:176,11D  !
5D	She knows I would not offend for the world. How does	203:176,12D  !
5D	Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have	203:176,13D  !
5D	you heard from Mrs% John Knightley lately? Oh| those	203:176,14D  !
5D	dear little children. Jane, do you know I always fancy	203:176,15D  !
5D	Mr% Dixon like Mr% John Knightley? I mean in person	203:176,16D  !
5D	~ tall, and with that sort of look~ and not very talkative."	203:176,17D  !
5D	"Very odd| but one never does form a just idea of	203:176,20D  !
5D	any body beforehand. One takes up a notion, and runs	203:176,21D  !
5D	away with it. Mr% Dixon, you say, is not, strictly speaking,	203:176,22D  !
5D	handsome."	203:176,23D  !
5D	"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not	203:176,26D  !
5D	allow him to be plain, and that you yourself~"	203:176,27D  !
5D	"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running	203:176,32D  !
5D	away. The weather does not look well, and grandmamma	203:176,33D  !
5D	will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse;	203:176,34D  !
5D	but we really must take leave. This has	203:176,35D  !
5D	been a most agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just	203:176,36D  !
5D	go round by Mrs% Cole's; but I shall not stop three	203:176,37D  !
5D	minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly~	203:176,38D  !
5D	I would not have you out in a shower|~ We think she is	203:177, 1D  !
5D	the better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do	203:177, 2D  !
5D	indeed. I shall not attempt calling on Mrs% Goddard, for	203:177, 3D  !
5D	I really do not think she cares for any thing but \boiled\	203:177, 4D  !
5D	pork: when we dress the leg it will be another thing.	203:177, 5D  !
5D	Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh| Mr% Knightley	203:177, 6D  !
5D	is coming too. Well, that is so very|~ I am sure if Jane	203:177, 7D  !
5D	is tired, you will be so kind as to give her your arm.~	203:177, 8D  !
5D	Mr% Elton, and Miss Hawkins.~ Good morning to you."	203:177, 9D  !
5M	"Oh| Miss Woodhouse,	203:177,29M  !
5M	what do you think has happened|"	203:177,30M  !
5M	"And so, there she had set, without	203:178,10M  !
5M	an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,	203:178,11M  !
5M	perhaps~ when, all of a sudden, who should come in~ to	203:178,12M  !
5M	be sure it was so very odd|~ but they always dealt at	203:178,13M  !
5M	Ford's~ who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and	203:178,14M  !
5M	her brother|~ Dear Miss Woodhouse| only think. I	203:178,15M  !
5M	thought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do.	203:178,16M  !
5M	I was sitting near the door~ Elizabeth saw me directly;	203:178,17M  !
5M	but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella. I am	203:178,18M  !
5M	sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took	203:178,19M  !
5M	no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end	203:178,20M  !
5M	of the shop; and I kept sitting near the door|~ Oh|	203:178,21M  !
5M	dear; I was so miserable| I am sure I must have been	203:178,22M  !
5M	as white as my gown. I could not go away you know,	203:178,23M  !
5M	because of the rain; but I did so wish myself any where	203:178,24M  !
5M	in the world but there.~ Oh| dear, Miss Woodhouse~	203:178,25M  !
5M	well, at last, I fancy, he looked round and saw me; for	203:178,26M  !
5M	instead of going on with their buyings, they began	203:178,27M  !
5M	whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking	203:178,28M  !
5M	of me; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading	203:178,29M  !
5M	her to speak to me~ (do you think he was,	203:178,30M  !
5M	Miss Woodhouse?)~ for presently she came forward~	203:178,31M  !
5M	came quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed	203:178,32M  !
5M	ready to shake hands, if I would. She did not do any of	203:178,33M  !
5M	it in the same way that she used; I could see she was	203:178,34M  !
5M	altered; but, however, she seemed to \try\ to be very	203:178,35M  !
5M	friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some	203:178,36M  !
5M	time; but I know no more what I said~ I was in such	203:178,37M  !
5M	a tremble|~ I remember she said she was sorry we never	203:178,38M  !
5M	met now; which I thought almost too kind| Dear,	203:179, 1M  !
5M	Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable| By that	203:179, 2M  !
5M	time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined	203:179, 3M  !
5M	that nothing should stop me from getting away~ and	203:179, 4M  !
5M	then~ only think|~ I found he was coming up towards	203:179, 5M  !
5M	me too~ slowly you know, and as if he did not quite	203:179, 6M  !
5M	know what to do; and so he came and spoke, and	203:179, 7M  !
5M	I answered~ and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully,	203:179, 8M  !
5M	you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage,	203:179, 9M  !
5M	and said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set;	203:179,10M  !
5M	and I had not got three yards from the door, when he	203:179,11M  !
5M	came after me, only to say, if I was going to Hartfield, he	203:179,12M  !
5M	thought I had much better go round by Mr% Cole's stables,	203:179,13M  !
5M	for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain.	203:179,14M  !
5M	Oh| dear, I thought it would have been the death of me|	203:179,15M  !
5M	So I said, I was very much obliged to him: you know	203:179,16M  !
5M	I could not do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth,	203:179,17M  !
5M	and I came round by the stables~ I believe I did~ but	203:179,18M  !
5M	I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh|	203:179,19M  !
5M	Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than	203:179,20M  !
5M	have had it happen: and yet, you know, there was a sort	203:179,21M  !
5M	of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so	203:179,22M  !
5M	kindly. And Elizabeth, too| Oh| Miss Woodhouse, do	203:179,23M  !
5M	talk to me and make me comfortable again."	203:179,24M  !
5A	"It might be distressing, for the moment,"	203:180, 6A  !
5A	"but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and	203:180, 7A  !
5A	it is over~ and may never~ can never, as a first meeting,	203:180, 8A  !
5A	occur again, and therefore you need not think about it."	203:180, 9A  !
5M	"very true;"	203:180,10M  !
5M	"would not think	203:180,10M  !
5M	about it;"	203:180,11M  !
5A	"This is too bad,"	205:187,35A  !
5A	"And now we shall just miss them; too provoking|	205:187,36A  !
5A	~ I do not know when I have been so disappointed."	205:187,37A  !
5N	"How d'ye do?~ how d'ye do?~ We have been sitting	205:188, 8N  !
5N	with your father~ glad to see him so well. Frank comes	205:188, 9N  !
5N	to-morrow~ I had a letter this morning~ we see him	205:188,10N  !
5N	to-morrow by dinner time to a certainty~ he is at Oxford	205:188,11N  !
5N	to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it	205:188,12N  !
5N	would be so. If he had come at Christmas he could not	205:188,13N  !
5N	have staid three days; I was always glad he did not	205:188,14N  !
5N	come at Christmas; now we are going to have just the	205:188,15N  !
5N	right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We	205:188,16N  !
5N	shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out	205:188,17N  !
5N	exactly as we could wish."	205:188,18N  !
5N	"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,"	205:188,35N  !
5O	"We had better move on, Mr% Weston,"	205:189, 1O  !
5O	"we	205:189, 1O  !
5O	are detaining the girls."	205:189, 2O  !
5N	"Well, well, I am ready;"~	205:189, 3N  !
5N	"but you must not be expecting such a \very\ fine	205:189, 4N  !
5N	young man; you have only had \my\ account you know;	205:189, 5N  !
5N	I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:"~	205:189, 6N  !
5O	"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four	205:189,11O  !
5O	o'clock,"	205:189,12O  !
5N	"Four o'clock|~ depend upon it he will be here by	205:189,14N  !
5N	three,"	205:189,15N  !
5M	"Will Mr% Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well	205:189,23M  !
5M	as Oxford?"~	205:189,24M  !
5N	"I told you yesterday,"	205:190,29N  !
5N	"I told you all that he would be here before the	205:190,30N  !
5N	time named. I remembered what I used to do myself.	205:190,31N  !
5N	One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help	205:190,32N  !
5N	getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure	205:190,33N  !
5N	of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out	205:190,34N  !
5N	begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion	205:190,35N  !
5N	it needs."	205:190,36N  !
5E	"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,"	205:190,37E  !
5E	"though there are not many houses	205:190,38E  !
5E	that I should presume on so far; but in coming \home\	205:191, 1E  !
5E	I felt I might do any thing."	205:191, 2E  !
5E	"Was she a horse-woman?~ Pleasant rides?~ Pleasant	205:191,22E  !
5E	walks?~ Had they a large neighbourhood?~ Highbury,	205:191,23E  !
5E	perhaps, afforded society enough?~ There were several	205:191,24E  !
5E	very pretty houses in and about it.~ Balls~ had they	205:191,25E  !
5E	balls?~ Was it a musical society?"	205:191,26E  !
5E	"His father's marriage,"	205:192, 2E  !
5E	"had been the wisest measure, every friend must	205:192, 3E  !
5E	rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received	205:192, 4E  !
5E	such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred	205:192, 5E  !
5E	the highest obligation on him."	205:192, 6E  !
5E	"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,"	205:192,15E  !
5E	"but I confess that, considering every thing,	205:192,16E  !
5E	I had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking	205:192,17E  !
5E	woman of a certain age; I did not know that	205:192,18E  !
5E	I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs% Weston."	205:192,19E  !
5A	"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs% Weston	205:192,20A  !
5A	for my feelings,"	205:192,21A  !
5A	"were you to guess her	205:192,21A  !
5A	to be \eighteen\, I should listen with pleasure; but \she\	205:192,22A  !
5A	would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words.	205:192,23A  !
5A	Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as	205:192,24A  !
5A	a pretty young woman."	205:192,25A  !
5E	"I hope I should know better,"	205:192,26E  !
5E	"no,	205:192,26E  !
5E	depend upon it,	205:192,27E  !
5E	that in addressing	205:192,27E  !
5E	Mrs% Weston I should understand whom I might praise	205:192,28E  !
5E	without any danger of being thought extravagant in my	205:192,29E  !
5E	terms."	205:192,30E  !
5E	"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take	205:193,31E  !
5E	the opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid	205:193,32E  !
5E	some day or other, and therefore may as well be paid	205:193,33E  !
5E	now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a	205:193,34E  !
5E	neighbour of yours,	205:193,35E  !
5E	a lady residing in	205:193,35E  !
5E	or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.	205:193,36E  !
5E	I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;	205:193,37E  !
5E	though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name ~ I	205:193,38E  !
5E	should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any	205:194, 1E  !
5E	family of that name?"	205:194, 2E  !
5N	"To be sure we do,"	205:194, 3N  !
5N	"Mrs% Bates ~	205:194, 3N  !
5N	we passed her house ~ I saw Miss Bates at the window.	205:194, 4N  !
5N	True, true, you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax;	205:194, 5N  !
5N	I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl	205:194, 6N  !
5N	she is. Call upon her, by all means."	205:194, 7N  !
5E	"There is no necessity for my calling this morning,"	205:194, 8E  !
5E	"another day would do as well; but	205:194, 9E  !
5E	there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth	205:194,10E  !
5E	which"~	205:194,11E  !
5N	"Oh| go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What	205:194,12N  !
5N	is right to be done cannot be done too soon. And, besides,	205:194,13N  !
5N	I must give you a hint, Frank; any want of attention to	205:194,14N  !
5N	her \here\ should be carefully avoided. You saw her with	205:194,15N  !
5N	the Campbells when she was the equal of every body she	205:194,16N  !
5N	mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother,	205:194,17N  !
5N	who has barely enough to live on. If you do not call early	205:194,18N  !
5N	it will be a slight."	205:194,19N  !
5A	"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,"	205:194,21A  !
5A	"she is a very elegant young woman."	205:194,22A  !
5E	"Yes,"	205:194,23E  !
5A	"If you were never particularly struck by her manners	205:194,28A  !
5A	before,"	205:194,29A  !
5A	"I think you will to-day. You will	205:194,29A  !
5A	see her to advantage; see her and hear her~ no, I am	205:194,30A  !
5A	afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an aunt	205:194,31A  !
5A	who never holds her tongue."	205:194,32A  !
5P	"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are	205:194,33P  !
5P	you?"	205:194,34P  !
5P	"then give me leave to assure	205:194,35P  !
5P	you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady.	205:194,36P  !
5P	She is staying here on a visit to her grandmamma and	205:194,37P  !
5P	aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my	205:194,38P  !
5P	life. They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure,	205:195, 1P  !
5P	and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the	205:195, 2P  !
5P	way."	205:195, 3P  !
5E	"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my	205:195, 4E  !
5E	father can direct me."	205:195, 5E  !
5P	"But your father is not going so far; he is only going	205:195, 6P  !
5P	to the Crown, quite on the other side of the street, and	205:195, 7P  !
5P	there are a great many houses; you might be very much	205:195, 8P  !
5P	at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on	205:195, 9P  !
5P	the foot-path; but my coachman can tell you where you	205:195,10P  !
5P	had best cross the street."	205:195,11P  !
5N	"My good friend, this is quite unnecessary;	205:195,14N  !
5N	Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it, and as	205:195,15N  !
5N	to Mrs% Bates's, he may get there from the Crown in	205:195,16N  !
5N	a hop, step and jump."	205:195,17N  !
5E	"Yes, oh| yes~	206:198,35E  !
5E	I was just going to	206:198,35E  !
5E	mention it. A very successful visit:~ I saw all the three	206:198,36E  !
5E	ladies; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory	206:198,37E  !
5E	hint. If the talking aunt had taken me quite	206:198,38E  !
5E	by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it	206:199, 1E  !
5E	was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable	206:199, 2E  !
5E	visit. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary,	206:199, 3E  !
5E	perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I	206:199, 4E  !
5E	should certainly be at home before him ~ but there was	206:199, 5E  !
5E	no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment,	206:199, 6E  !
5E	I found, when he (finding me no where else) joined me	206:199, 7E  !
5E	there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them	206:199, 8E  !
5E	very nearly three quarters of an hour. The good lady had	206:199, 9E  !
5E	not given me the possibility of escape before."	206:199,10E  !
5A	"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?"	206:199,11A  !
5E	"Ill, very ill ~ that is, if a young lady can ever be	206:199,12E  !
5E	allowed to look ill. But the expression is hardly admissible,	206:199,13E  !
5E	Mrs% Weston, is it? Ladies can never look ill. And,	206:199,14E  !
5E	seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale, as almost	206:199,15E  !
5E	always to give the appearance of ill health.~ A most	206:199,16E  !
5E	deplorable want of complexion."	206:199,17E  !
5A	"It was certainly	206:199,19A  !
5A	never brilliant, but she would not allow it to have a sickly	206:199,20A  !
5A	hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in	206:199,21A  !
5A	her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of	206:199,22A  !
5A	her face."	206:199,23A  !
5A	"Well,"	206:199,31A  !
5A	"there is no disputing about	206:199,31A  !
5A	taste.~ At least you admire her except her complexion."	206:199,32A  !
5E	"I cannot separate	206:199,33E  !
5E	Miss Fairfax and her complexion."	206:199,34E  !
5A	"Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you	206:199,35A  !
5A	often in the same society?"	206:199,36A  !
5E	"Ha| this must be the very shop	206:199,38E  !
5E	that every body attends every day of their lives, as my	206:200, 1E  !
5E	father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he	206:200, 2E  !
5E	says, six days out of the seven, and has always business	206:200, 3E  !
5E	at Ford's. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us	206:200, 4E  !
5E	go in, that I may prove myself to belong to the place, to be	206:200, 5E  !
5E	a true citizen of Highbury. I must buy something at	206:200, 6E  !
5E	Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.~ I dare say	206:200, 7E  !
5E	they sell gloves."	206:200, 8E  !
5A	"Oh| yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your	206:200, 9A  !
5A	patriotism. You will be adored in Highbury. You were	206:200,10A  !
5A	very popular before you came, because you were Mr% Weston's	206:200,11A  !
5A	son~ but lay out half-a-guinea at Ford's, and	206:200,12A  !
5A	your popularity will stand upon your own virtues."	206:200,13A  !
5E	"But I beg your	206:200,16E  !
5E	pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me, you	206:200,17E  !
5E	were saying something at the very moment of this burst	206:200,18E  !
5E	of my \amor patria e\. Do not let me lose it. I assure you	206:200,19E  !
5E	the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me	206:200,20E  !
5E	amends for the loss of any happiness in private life."	206:200,21E  !
5A	"I merely asked, whether you had known much of	206:200,22A  !
5A	Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth."	206:200,23A  !
5E	"And now that I understand your question, I must	206:200,24E  !
5E	pronounce it to be a very unfair one. It is always the	206:200,25E  !
5E	lady's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance.	206:200,26E  !
5E	Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.~ I	206:200,27E  !
5E	shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may	206:200,28E  !
5E	chuse to allow."	206:200,29E  !
5A	"Upon my word| you answer as discreetly as she could	206:200,30A  !
5A	do herself. But her account of every thing leaves so much	206:200,31A  !
5A	to be guessed, she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to	206:200,32A  !
5A	give the least information about any body, that I really	206:200,33A  !
5A	think you may say what you like of your acquaintance	206:200,34A  !
5A	with her."	206:200,35A  !
5E	"May I indeed?~ Then I will speak the truth, and	206:200,36E  !
5E	nothing suits me so well. I met her frequently at Weymouth.	206:200,37E  !
5E	I had known the Campbells a little in town; and	206:200,38E  !
5E	at Weymouth we were very much in the same set. Col% Campbell	206:201, 1E  !
5E	is a very agreeable man, and Mrs% Campbell a	206:201, 2E  !
5E	friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all."	206:201, 3E  !
5A	"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude;	206:201, 4A  !
5A	what she is destined to be."	206:201, 5A  !
5E	"Yes~	206:201, 6E  !
5E	~ "I believe I do."	206:201, 6E  !
5O	"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,"	206:201, 7O  !
5O	"remember that I am here.~ Mr% Frank Churchill	206:201, 8O  !
5O	hardly knows what to say when you speak of	206:201, 9O  !
5O	Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a little	206:201,10O  !
5O	farther off."	206:201,11O  !
5A	"I certainly do forget to think of \her\,"	206:201,12A  !
5A	"as having ever been any thing but my friend and my	206:201,13A  !
5A	dearest friend."	206:201,14A  !
5E	"Did you ever hear the young lady we were	206:201,18E  !
5E	speaking of, play?"	206:201,19E  !
5A	"Ever hear her|"	206:201,20A  !
5A	"You forget how	206:201,20A  !
5A	much she belongs to Highbury. I have heard her every	206:201,21A  !
5A	year of our lives since we both began. She plays charmingly."	206:201,22A  !
5E	"You think so, do you?~ I wanted the opinion of some one	206:201,24E  !
5E	who could really judge. She appeared to me to play	206:201,25E  !
5E	well, that is, with considerable taste, but I know nothing	206:201,26E  !
5E	of the matter myself.~ I am excessively fond of music, but	206:201,27E  !
5E	without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body's	206:201,28E  !
5E	performance.~ I have been used to hear her's admired;	206:201,29E  !
5E	and I remember one proof of her being thought to play	206:201,30E  !
5E	well:~ a man, a very musical man, and in love with	206:201,31E  !
5E	another woman ~ engaged to her ~ on the point of marriage	206:201,32E  !
5E	~ would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to	206:201,33E  !
5E	the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down	206:201,34E  !
5E	instead~ never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear	206:201,35E  !
5E	the other. That I thought, in a man of known musical	206:201,36E  !
5E	talent, was some proof."	206:201,37E  !
5A	"Proof, indeed|"	206:201,38A  !
5A	"Mr% Dixon is very musical, is he? We shall know more	206:202, 1A  !
5A	about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax	206:202, 2A  !
5A	would have vouchsafed in half a year."	206:202, 3A  !
5E	"Yes, Mr% Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons;	206:202, 4E  !
5E	and I thought it a very strong proof."	206:202, 5E  !
5A	"Certainly~ very strong it was; to own the truth, a	206:202, 6A  !
5A	great deal stronger than, if \I\ had been Miss Campbell,	206:202, 7A  !
5A	would have been at all agreeable to me. I could not	206:202, 8A  !
5A	excuse a man's having more music than love~ more ear	206:202, 9A  !
5A	than eye~ a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to	206:202,10A  !
5A	my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?"	206:202,11A  !
5E	"It was her very particular friend, you know."	206:202,12E  !
5A	"Poor comfort|"	206:202,13A  !
5A	"One would	206:202,13A  !
5A	rather have a stranger preferred than one's very particular	206:202,14A  !
5A	friend~ with a stranger it might not recur again~ but	206:202,15A  !
5A	the misery of having a very particular friend always at	206:202,16A  !
5A	hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself|~	206:202,17A  !
5A	Poor Mrs% Dixon| Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in	206:202,18A  !
5A	Ireland."	206:202,19A  !
5E	"You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell;	206:202,20E  !
5E	but she really did not seem to feel it."	206:202,21E  !
5A	"So much the better~ or so much the worse:~ I do not	206:202,22A  !
5A	know which. But, be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her	206:202,23A  !
5A	~ quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling~ there was	206:202,24A  !
5A	one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax	206:202,25A  !
5A	herself. \She\ must have felt the improper and dangerous	206:202,26A  !
5A	distinction."	206:202,27A  !
5E	"As to that~ I do not~"	206:202,28E  !
5A	"Oh| do not imagine that I expect an account of	206:202,29A  !
5A	Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else.	206:202,30A  !
5A	They are known to no human being, I guess, but herself.	206:202,31A  !
5A	But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by	206:202,32A  !
5A	Mr% Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."	206:202,33A  !
5E	"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding	206:202,34E  !
5E	among them all~"	206:202,35E  !
5E	"however, it is impossible for me to	206:202,36E  !
5E	say on what terms they really were~ how it might all be	206:202,37E  !
5E	behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness	206:202,38E  !
5E	outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax	206:203, 1E  !
5E	from a child, must be a better judge of her character, and	206:203, 2E  !
5E	of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations,	206:203, 3E  !
5E	than I can be."	206:203, 4E  !
5A	"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we	206:203, 5A  !
5A	have been children and women together; and it is	206:203, 6A  !
5A	natural to suppose that we should be intimate.~ that we	206:203, 7A  !
5A	should have taken to each other whenever she visited her	206:203, 8A  !
5A	friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has	206:203, 9A  !
5A	happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my	206:203,10A  !
5A	side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so	206:203,11A  !
5A	idolized and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and	206:203,12A  !
5A	grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve~	206:203,13A  !
5A	I never could attach myself to any one so completely	206:203,14A  !
5A	reserved."	206:203,15A  !
5E	"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,"	206:203,16E  !
5E	"Oftentimes very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing.	206:203,17E  !
5E	There is safety in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot	206:203,18E  !
5E	love a reserved person."	206:203,19E  !
5A	"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then	206:203,20A  !
5A	the attraction may be the greater. But I must be more in	206:203,21A  !
5A	want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have	206:203,22A  !
5A	yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body's	206:203,23A  !
5A	reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss Fairfax	206:203,24A  !
5A	and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to	206:203,25A  !
5A	think ill of her~ not the least~ except that such extreme	206:203,26A  !
5A	and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a	206:203,27A  !
5A	dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to	206:203,28A  !
5A	suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal."	206:203,29A  !
5O	"all young people would have their little whims."	207:205,22O  !
5O	"all young people	207:206,17O  !
5O	would have their little whims."	207:206,18O  !
5B	"Hum|	207:206,29B  !
5B	just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for."	207:206,30B  !
5O	"I suppose	207:207,37O  !
5O	they will not take the liberty with you; they know you	207:207,38O  !
5O	do not dine out,"	207:208, 1O  !
5A	"of course it must be declined,"	207:208,18A  !
5P	"I am not fond of dinner-visiting,"	207:209, 4P  !
5P	"I never	207:209, 4P  !
5P	was. No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with	207:209, 5P  !
5P	us. I am sorry Mr% and Mrs% Cole should have done it.	207:209, 6P  !
5P	I think it would be much better if they would come in	207:209, 7P  !
5P	one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us	207:209, 8P  !
5P	~ take us in their afternoon walk; which they might do,	207:209, 9P  !
5P	as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without	207:209,10P  !
5P	being out in the damp of the evening. The dews of	207:209,11P  !
5P	a summer evening are what I would not expose any body	207:209,12P  !
5P	to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear	207:209,13P  !
5P	Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there,	207:209,14P  !
5P	and Mr% Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish	207:209,15P  !
5P	to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought,	207:209,16P  !
5P	neither damp, nor cold, nor windy."	207:209,17P  !
5P	"Ah|	207:209,18P  !
5P	Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid	207:209,19P  !
5P	at home with me."	207:209,20P  !
5N	"Well, sir,"	207:209,21N  !
5N	"as I took Miss Taylor	207:209,21N  !
5N	away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can;	207:209,22N  !
5N	and I will step to Mrs% Goddard in a moment, if you	207:209,23N  !
5N	wish it."	207:209,24N  !
5P	"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as	207:209,35P  !
5P	possible. You will say that I am quite an invalid, and	207:209,36P  !
5P	go no where, and therefore must decline their obliging	207:209,37P  !
5P	invitation; beginning with my \compliments\, of course.	207:209,38P  !
5P	But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you	207:210, 1P  !
5P	what is to be done. We must remember to let James	207:210, 2P  !
5P	know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday.	207:210, 3P  !
5P	I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never	207:210, 4P  !
5P	been there above once since the new approach was made;	207:210, 5P  !
5P	but still I have no doubt that James will take you very	207:210, 6P  !
5P	safely. And when you get there, you must tell him at	207:210, 7P  !
5P	what time you would have him come for you again; and	207:210, 8P  !
5P	you had better name an early hour. You will not like	207:210, 9P  !
5P	staying late. You will get very tired when tea is over."	207:210,10P  !
5A	"But you would not wish me to come away before I am	207:210,11A  !
5A	tired, papa?"	207:210,12A  !
5P	"Oh| no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There	207:210,13P  !
5P	will be a great many people talking at once. You will	207:210,14P  !
5P	not like the noise."	207:210,15P  !
5N	"But, my dear sir,"	207:210,16N  !
5N	"if Emma	207:210,16N  !
5N	comes away early, it will be breaking up the party."	207:210,17N  !
5P	"And no great harm if it does,"	207:210,18P  !
5P	"The sooner every party breaks up, the better."	207:210,19P  !
5N	"But you do not consider how it may appear to the	207:210,20N  !
5N	Coles. Emma's going away directly after tea might be	207:210,21N  !
5N	giving offence. They are good-natured people, and think	207:210,22N  !
5N	little of their own claims; but still they must feel that	207:210,23N  !
5N	any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and	207:210,24N  !
5N	Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of	207:210,25N  !
5N	than any other person's in the room. You would not	207:210,26N  !
5N	wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir;	207:210,27N  !
5N	friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have	207:210,28N  !
5N	been your neighbours these \ten\ years."	207:210,29N  !
5P	"No, upon no account in the world. Mr% Weston,	207:210,30P  !
5P	I am much obliged to you for reminding me. I should	207:210,31P  !
5P	be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain. I know	207:210,32P  !
5P	what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that	207:210,33P  !
5P	Mr% Cole never touches malt liquor. You would not think	207:210,34P  !
5P	it to look at him, but he is bilious~ Mr% Cole is very bilious.	207:210,35P  !
5P	No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain.	207:210,36P  !
5P	My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure, rather	207:210,37P  !
5P	than run the risk of hurting Mr% and Mrs% Cole, you would	207:210,38P  !
5P	stay a little longer than you might wish. You will not	207:211, 1P  !
5P	regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, you know,	207:211, 2P  !
5P	among your friends."	207:211, 3P  !
5A	"Oh, yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself;	207:211, 4A  !
5A	and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs% Weston,	207:211, 5A  !
5A	but on your account. I am only afraid of your	207:211, 6A  !
5A	sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being	207:211, 7A  !
5A	exceedingly comfortable with Mrs% Goddard. She loves	207:211, 8A  !
5A	piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am	207:211, 9A  !
5A	afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going	207:211,10A  !
5A	to bed at your usual time~ and the idea of that would	207:211,11A  !
5A	entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not	207:211,12A  !
5A	to sit up."	207:211,13A  !
5A	"This is coming as you should do,"	208:213,27A  !
5A	"like	208:213,27A  !
5A	a gentleman.~ I am quite glad to see you."	208:213,28A  !
5B	"How lucky that we should	208:213,29B  !
5B	arrive at the same moment| for, if we had met first in	208:213,30B  !
5B	the drawing-room, I doubt whether you would have	208:213,31B  !
5B	discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.~	208:213,32B  !
5B	You might not have distinguished how I came, by my	208:213,33B  !
5B	look or manner."	208:213,34B  !
5A	"Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always	208:213,35A  !
5A	a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in	208:213,36A  !
5A	a way which they know to be beneath them. You think	208:213,37A  !
5A	you carry it off very well, I dare say, but with you it	208:213,38A  !
5A	is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I	208:214, 1A  !
5A	always observe it whenever I meet you under those	208:214, 2A  !
5A	circumstances. \Now\ you have nothing to try for. You	208:214, 3A  !
5A	are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You are not	208:214, 4A  !
5A	striving to look taller than any body else. \Now\ I shall	208:214, 5A  !
5A	really be very happy to walk into the same room with	208:214, 6A  !
5A	you."	208:214, 7A  !
5B	"Nonsensical girl|"	208:214, 8B  !
5A	"Why do you smile?"	208:216,15A  !
5E	"Nay, why do you?"	208:216,16E  !
5A	"Me|~ I suppose I smile for pleasure at Col% Campbell's	208:216,17A  !
5A	being so rich and so liberal.~ It is a handsome	208:216,18A  !
5A	present."	208:216,19A  !
5E	"Very."	208:216,20E  !
5A	"I rather wonder that it was never made before."	208:216,21A  !
5E	"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so	208:216,22E  !
5E	long before."	208:216,23E  !
5A	"Or that he did not give her the use of their own	208:216,24A  !
5A	instrument~ which must now be shut up in London,	208:216,25A  !
5A	untouched by any body."	208:216,26A  !
5E	"That is a grand pianoforte=, and he might think it too	208:216,27E  !
5E	large for Mrs% Bates's house."	208:216,28E  !
5A	"You may \say\ what you chuse~ but your countenance	208:216,29A  !
5A	testifies that your \thoughts\ on this subject are very much	208:216,30A  !
5A	like mine."	208:216,31A  !
5E	"I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me	208:216,32E  !
5E	more credit for acuteness than I deserve. I smile because	208:216,33E  !
5E	you smile, and shall probably suspect whatever I find you	208:216,34E  !
5E	suspect; but at present I do not see what there is to	208:216,35E  !
5E	question. If Col% Campbell is not the person, who can	208:216,36E  !
5E	be?"	208:216,37E  !
5A	"What do you say to Mrs% Dixon?"	208:216,38A  !
5E	"Mrs% Dixon| very true indeed. I had not thought	208:217, 1E  !
5E	of Mrs% Dixon. She must know as well as her father, how	208:217, 2E  !
5E	acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the	208:217, 3E  !
5E	mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young	208:217, 4E  !
5E	woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs% Dixon	208:217, 5E  !
5E	I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide	208:217, 6E  !
5E	mine."	208:217, 7E  !
5A	"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend	208:217, 8A  !
5A	\Mr%\ Dixon in them."	208:217, 9A  !
5E	"Mr% Dixon.~ Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive	208:217,10E  !
5E	that it must be the joint present of Mr% and Mrs% Dixon.	208:217,11E  !
5E	We were speaking the other day, you know, of his being	208:217,12E  !
5E	so warm an admirer of her performance."	208:217,13E  !
5A	"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed	208:217,14A  !
5A	an idea which I had entertained before.~ I do not mean	208:217,15A  !
5A	to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr% Dixon	208:217,16A  !
5A	or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that,	208:217,17A  !
5A	after making his proposals to her friend, he had the	208:217,18A  !
5A	misfortune to fall in love with \her\, or that he became	208:217,19A  !
5A	conscious of a little attachment on her side. One might	208:217,20A  !
5A	guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right;	208:217,21A  !
5A	but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her	208:217,22A  !
5A	chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the	208:217,23A  !
5A	Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life	208:217,24A  !
5A	of privation and penance; there it would have been all	208:217,25A  !
5A	enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her native air,	208:217,26A  !
5A	I look upon that as a mere excuse.~ In the summer it	208:217,27A  !
5A	might have passed; but what can any body's native air	208:217,28A  !
5A	do for them in the months of January, February, and	208:217,29A  !
5A	March? Good fires and carriages would be much more	208:217,30A  !
5A	to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare	208:217,31A  !
5A	say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,	208:217,32A  !
5A	though you make so noble a profession of doing	208:217,33A  !
5A	it, but I honestly tell you what they are."	208:217,34A  !
5E	"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability.	208:217,35E  !
5E	Mr% Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's,	208:217,36E  !
5E	I can answer for being very decided."	208:217,37E  !
5A	"And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of	208:217,38A  !
5A	that?~ A water-party; and by some accident she was	208:218, 1A  !
5A	falling overboard. He caught her."	208:218, 2A  !
5E	"He did. I was there~ one of the party."	208:218, 3E  !
5A	"Were you really?~ Well|~ But you observed nothing	208:218, 4A  !
5A	of course, for it seems to be a new idea to you.~	208:218, 5A  !
5A	If I had been there, I think I should have made some	208:218, 6A  !
5A	discoveries."	208:218, 7A  !
5E	"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing	208:218, 8E  !
5E	but the fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from	208:218, 9E  !
5E	the vessel and that Mr% Dixon caught her.~ It was the	208:218,10E  !
5E	work of a moment. And though the consequent shock	208:218,11E  !
5E	and alarm was very great and much more durable~	208:218,12E  !
5E	indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were	208:218,13E  !
5E	comfortable again~ yet that was too general a sensation	208:218,14E  !
5E	for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do	208:218,15E  !
5E	not mean to say, however, that you might not have	208:218,16E  !
5E	made discoveries."	208:218,17E  !
5A	"The arrival of this pianoforte= is decisive with me.	208:218,25A  !
5A	I wanted to know a little more, and this tells me quite	208:218,26A  !
5A	enough. Depend upon it, we shall soon hear that it is	208:218,27A  !
5A	a present from Mr% and Mrs% Dixon."	208:218,28A  !
5E	"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge	208:218,29E  !
5E	of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells."	208:218,30E  !
5A	"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells Miss Fairfax	208:218,32A  !
5A	knows it is not from the Campbells, or they would	208:218,33A  !
5A	have been guessed at first. She would not have been	208:218,34A  !
5A	puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have	208:218,35A  !
5A	convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced	208:218,36A  !
5A	myself that Mr% Dixon is a principal in the business."	208:218,37A  !
5E	"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.	208:218,38E  !
5E	Your reasonings carry my judgment along with	208:219, 1E  !
5E	them entirely. At first, while I supposed you satisfied	208:219, 2E  !
5E	that Col% Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as paternal	208:219, 3E  !
5E	kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the	208:219, 4E  !
5E	world. But when you mentioned Mrs% Dixon, I felt how	208:219, 5E  !
5E	much more probable that it should be the tribute of	208:219, 6E  !
5E	warm female friendship. And now I can see it in no	208:219, 7E  !
5E	other light than as an offering of love."	208:219, 8E  !
5E	"I have made a most wretched discovery,"	208:221,36E  !
5E	"I have been here a week to-morrow	208:221,37E  !
5E	~ half my time. I never knew days fly so fast. A week	208:221,38E  !
5E	to-morrow| ~ And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself.	208:222, 1E  !
5E	But just got acquainted with Mrs% Weston, and others|~	208:222, 2E  !
5E	I hate the recollection."	208:222, 3E  !
5A	"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent	208:222, 4A  !
5A	one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut."	208:222, 5A  !
5E	"No,"	208:222, 6E  !
5E	"that is no subject of regret	208:222, 6E  !
5E	at all. I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless	208:222, 7E  !
5E	I can believe myself fit to be seen."	208:222, 8E  !
5A	"What is the matter?"	208:222,15A  !
5E	"Thank you for rousing me,"	208:222,16E  !
5E	"I believe I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax	208:222,17E  !
5E	has done her hair in so odd a way~ so very odd a way~	208:222,18E  !
5E	that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw any thing	208:222,19E  !
5E	so outre=e|~ Those curls|~ This must be a fancy of	208:222,20E  !
5E	her own. I see nobody else looking like her|~ I must go	208:222,21E  !
5E	and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion. Shall I?~ Yes,	208:222,22E  !
5E	I will~ I declare I will~ and you shall see how she takes	208:222,23E  !
5E	it;~ whether she colours."	208:222,24E  !
5O	"This is the luxury of a large party,"	208:222,32O  !
5O	"one	208:222,32O  !
5O	can get near every body, and say every thing. My dear	208:222,33O  !
5O	Emma, I am longing to talk to you. I have been making	208:222,34O  !
5O	discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and	208:222,35O  !
5O	I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how	208:222,36O  !
5O	Miss Bates and her niece came here?"	208:222,37O  !
5A	"How|~ They were invited, were not they?"	208:222,38A  !
5O	"Oh| yes~ but how they were conveyed hither?~ the	208:223, 1O  !
5O	manner of their coming?"	208:223, 2O  !
5A	"They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?"	208:223, 3A  !
5O	"Very true.~ Well, a little while ago it occurred to me	208:223, 4O  !
5O	how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking	208:223, 5O  !
5O	home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now.	208:223, 6O  !
5O	And as I looked at her, though I never saw her appear to	208:223, 7O  !
5O	more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and	208:223, 8O  !
5O	would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor	208:223, 9O  !
5O	girl| I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as	208:223,10O  !
5O	Mr% Weston came into the room, and I could get at him,	208:223,11O  !
5O	I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess how	208:223,12O  !
5O	readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation,	208:223,13O  !
5O	I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her	208:223,14O  !
5O	that the carriage would be at her service before it took	208:223,15O  !
5O	us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable	208:223,16O  !
5O	at once. Good soul| she was as grateful as possible,	208:223,17O  !
5O	you may be sure.	208:223,18O  !
5O	but with many, many thanks,~	208:223,19O  !
5O	I was quite	208:223,21O  !
5O	surprized;~ very glad, I am sure; but really quite	208:223,22O  !
5O	surprized. Such a very kind attention~ and so thoughtful	208:223,23O  !
5O	an attention|~ the sort of thing that so few men would	208:223,24O  !
5O	think of. And, in short, from knowing his usual ways,	208:223,25O  !
5O	I am very much inclined to think that it was for their	208:223,26O  !
5O	accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect	208:223,27O  !
5O	he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that	208:223,28O  !
5O	it was only as an excuse for assisting them."	208:223,29O  !
5A	"Very likely,"	208:223,30A  !
5A	"nothing more likely.	208:223,30A  !
5A	I know no man more likely than Mr% Knightley to do the	208:223,31A  !
5A	sort of thing~ to do any thing really good-natured, useful,	208:223,32A  !
5A	considerate, or benevolent. He is not a gallant man, but	208:223,33A  !
5A	he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane Fairfax's	208:223,34A  !
5A	ill health, would appear a case of humanity to	208:223,35A  !
5A	him;~ and for an act of un-ostentatious kindness, there is	208:223,36A  !
5A	nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr% Knightley.	208:223,37A  !
5A	I know he had horses to-day~ for we arrived together;	208:223,38A  !
5A	and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that	208:224, 1A  !
5A	could betray."	208:224, 2A  !
5O	"Well,"	208:224, 3O  !
5O	"you give him	208:224, 3O  !
5O	credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this	208:224, 4O  !
5O	instance than I do; for while Miss Bates was speaking,	208:224, 5O  !
5O	a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never been	208:224, 6O  !
5O	able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more	208:224, 7O  !
5O	probable it appears. In short, I have made a match	208:224, 8O  !
5O	between Mr% Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence	208:224, 9O  !
5O	of keeping you company|~ What do you say	208:224,10O  !
5O	to it?"	208:224,11O  !
5A	"Mr% Knightley and Jane Fairfax|"	208:224,12A  !
5A	"Dear Mrs% Weston, how could you think of such a	208:224,13A  !
5A	thing?~ Mr% Knightley|~ Mr% Knightley must not	208:224,14A  !
5A	marry|~ You would not have little Henry cut out from	208:224,15A  !
5A	Donwell?~ Oh| no, no, Henry must have Donwell.	208:224,16A  !
5A	I cannot at all consent to Mr% Knightley's marrying; and	208:224,17A  !
5A	I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you	208:224,18A  !
5A	should think of such a thing."	208:224,19A  !
5O	"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think	208:224,20O  !
5O	of it. I do not want the match~ I do not want to injure	208:224,21O  !
5O	dear little Henry~ but the idea has been given me by	208:224,22O  !
5O	circumstances; and if Mr% Knightley really wished to	208:224,23O  !
5O	marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account,	208:224,24O  !
5O	a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?"	208:224,25O  !
5A	"Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.~	208:224,26A  !
5A	Mr% Knightley marry|~ No, I have never had	208:224,27A  !
5A	such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now. And Jane Fairfax,	208:224,28A  !
5A	too, of all women|"	208:224,29A  !
5O	"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him,	208:224,30O  !
5O	as you very well know."	208:224,31O  !
5A	"But the imprudence of such a match|"	208:224,32A  !
5O	"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its	208:224,33O  !
5O	probability."	208:224,34O  !
5A	"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better	208:224,35A  !
5A	foundation than what you mention. His good-nature,	208:224,36A  !
5A	his humanity, as I tell you, would be quite enough to	208:224,37A  !
5A	account for the horses. He has a great regard for the	208:224,38A  !
5A	Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax~ and is	208:225, 1A  !
5A	always glad to shew them attention. My dear Mrs% Weston,	208:225, 2A  !
5A	do not take to match-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax	208:225, 3A  !
5A	mistress of the Abbey|~ Oh| no, no;~ every	208:225, 4A  !
5A	feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him	208:225, 5A  !
5A	do so mad a thing."	208:225, 6A  !
5O	"Imprudent, if you please~ but not mad. Excepting	208:225, 7O  !
5O	inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age,	208:225, 8O  !
5O	I can see nothing unsuitable."	208:225, 9O  !
5A	"But Mr% Knightley does not want to marry. I am	208:225,10A  !
5A	sure he has not the least idea of it. Do not put it into his	208:225,11A  !
5A	head. Why should he marry?~ He is as happy as possible	208:225,12A  !
5A	by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his library,	208:225,13A  !
5A	and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond	208:225,14A  !
5A	of his brother's children. He has no occasion to marry,	208:225,15A  !
5A	either to fill up his time or his heart."	208:225,16A  !
5O	"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but	208:225,17O  !
5O	if he really loves Jane Fairfax~"	208:225,18O  !
5A	"Nonsense| He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In	208:225,19A  !
5A	the way of love, I am sure he does not. He would do any	208:225,20A  !
5A	good to her, or her family; but~"	208:225,21A  !
5O	"Well,"	208:225,22O  !
5O	"perhaps the	208:225,22O  !
5O	greatest good he could do them, would be to give Jane	208:225,23O  !
5O	such a respectable home."	208:225,24O  !
5A	"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil	208:225,25A  !
5A	to himself; a very shameful and degrading connection.	208:225,26A  !
5A	How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?	208:225,27A  !
5A	~ To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking him	208:225,28A  !
5A	all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?~	208:225,29A  !
5A	""So very kind and obliging|~ But he always had been	208:225,30A  !
5A	such a very kind neighbour|"" And then fly off, through	208:225,31A  !
5A	half a sentence, to her mother's old petticoat. ""Not that	208:225,32A  !
5A	it was such a very old petticoat either~ for still it would	208:225,33A  !
5A	last a great while~ and, indeed, she must thankfully say	208:225,34A  !
5A	that their petticoats were all very strong."	208:225,35A  !
5O	"For shame, Emma| Do not mimic her. You divert	208:225,36O  !
5O	me against my conscience. And, upon my word, I do not	208:225,37O  !
5O	think Mr% Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates.	208:225,38O  !
5O	Little things do not irritate him. She might talk	208:226, 1O  !
5O	on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would	208:226, 2O  !
5O	only talk louder, and drown her voice. But the question	208:226, 3O  !
5O	is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but	208:226, 4O  !
5O	whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have heard	208:226, 5O  !
5O	him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax|	208:226, 6O  !
5O	The interest he takes in her~ his anxiety about	208:226, 7O  !
5O	her health~ his concern that she should have no happier	208:226, 8O  !
5O	prospect| I have heard him express himself so warmly	208:226, 9O  !
5O	on those points|~ Such an admirer of her performance	208:226,10O  !
5O	on the pianoforte=, and of her voice| I have heard him say	208:226,11O  !
5O	that he could listen to her for ever. Oh| and I had almost	208:226,12O  !
5O	forgotten one idea that occurred to me~ this pianoforte=	208:226,13O  !
5O	that has been sent her by somebody~ though we have all	208:226,14O  !
5O	been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the	208:226,15O  !
5O	Campbells, may it not be from Mr% Knightley? I cannot	208:226,16O  !
5O	help suspecting him. I think he is just the person to do	208:226,17O  !
5O	it, even without being in love."	208:226,18O  !
5A	"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in	208:226,19A  !
5A	love. But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him	208:226,20A  !
5A	to do. Mr% Knightley does nothing mysteriously."	208:226,21A  !
5O	"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument	208:226,22O  !
5O	repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance	208:226,23O  !
5O	would, in the common course of things, occur to	208:226,24O  !
5O	him."	208:226,25O  !
5A	"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one,	208:226,26A  !
5A	he would have told her so."	208:226,27A  !
5O	"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.	208:226,28O  !
5O	I have a very strong notion that it comes from him.	208:226,29O  !
5O	I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs% Cole told	208:226,30O  !
5O	us of it at dinner."	208:226,31O  !
5A	"You take up an idea, Mrs% Weston, and run away	208:226,32A  !
5A	with it; as you have many a time reproached me with	208:226,33A  !
5A	doing. I see no sign of attachment~ I believe nothing	208:226,34A  !
5A	of the pianoforte=~ and proof only shall convince me that	208:226,35A  !
5A	Mr% Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax."	208:226,36A  !
5A	"I often feel concerned,"	208:228,18A  !
5A	"that I dare not	208:228,18A  !
5A	make \our\ carriage more useful on such occasions. It is	208:228,19A  !
5A	not that I am without the wish; but you know how	208:228,20A  !
5A	impossible my father would deem it that James should	208:228,21A  !
5A	put-to for such a purpose."	208:228,22A  !
5B	"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,"	208:228,23B  !
5B	"but you must often wish it, I am sure."	208:228,24B  !
5A	"This present from the Campbells,"	208:228,27A  !
5A	"This	208:228,27A  !
5A	pianoforte= is very kindly given."	208:228,28A  !
5B	"Yes,"	208:228,29B  !
5B	"But they would have done better had	208:228,30B  !
5B	they given her notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things.	208:228,31B  !
5B	The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is	208:228,32B  !
5B	often considerable. I should have expected better judgment	208:228,33B  !
5B	in Colonel Campbell."	208:228,34B  !
5B	"That will do,"	208:229, 3B  !
5B	"You have sung quite enough for one evening~	208:229, 4B  !
5B	now, be quiet."	208:229, 5B  !
5E	"I think you could manage	208:229, 9E  !
5E	this without effort; the first part is so trifling. The	208:229,10E  !
5E	strength of the song falls on the second."	208:229,11E  !
5B	"That fellow,"	208:229,13B  !
5B	"thinks of nothing	208:229,13B  !
5B	but showing off his own voice. This must not be."	208:229,14B  !
5B	"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing herself	208:229,16B  !
5B	hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have	208:229,17B  !
5B	no mercy on her."	208:229,18B  !
5E	"Perhaps it is as well,"	208:230,16E  !
5E	"I must have asked	208:230,17E  !
5E	Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing would not have	208:230,18E  !
5E	agreed with me, after your's."	208:230,19E  !
5M	"Oh| if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax|"	209:231,27M  !
5A	"Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no	209:231,29A  !
5A	more like her's, than a lamp is like sunshine."	209:231,30A  !
5M	"Oh| dear~ I think you play the best of the two. I	209:231,31M  !
5M	think you play quite as well as she does. I am sure I had	209:231,32M  !
5M	much rather hear you. Every body last night said how	209:232, 1M  !
5M	well you played."	209:232, 2M  !
5A	"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt	209:232, 3A  !
5A	the difference. The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is	209:232, 4A  !
5A	just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax's is much	209:232, 5A  !
5A	beyond it."	209:232, 6A  !
5M	"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well	209:232, 7M  !
5M	as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would	209:232, 8M  !
5M	ever find it out. Mr% Cole said how much taste you had;	209:232, 9M  !
5M	and Mr% Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your	209:232,10M  !
5M	taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution."	209:232,11M  !
5A	"Ah| but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet."	209:232,12A  !
5M	"Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did	209:232,13M  !
5M	not know she had any taste. Nobody talked about it.	209:232,14M  !
5M	And I hate Italian singing.~ There is no understanding a	209:232,15M  !
5M	word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you	209:232,16M  !
5M	know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she	209:232,17M  !
5M	will have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night	209:232,18M  !
5M	whether she would get into any great family. How did	209:232,19M  !
5M	you think the Coxes looked?"	209:232,20M  !
5A	"Just as they always do~ very vulgar."	209:232,21A  !
5M	"They told me something,"	209:232,22M  !
5M	"but it is nothing of any consequence."	209:232,23M  !
5M	"They told me~ that Mr% Martin dined with them last	209:232,26M  !
5M	Saturday."	209:232,27M  !
5A	"Oh|"	209:232,28A  !
5M	"He came to their father upon some business, and he	209:232,29M  !
5M	asked him to stay dinner."	209:232,30M  !
5A	"Oh|"	209:232,31A  !
5M	"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox	209:232,32M  !
5M	I do not know what she meant, but she asked me	209:232,33M  !
5M	if I thought I should go and stay there again next	209:232,34M  !
5M	summer."	209:232,35M  !
5A	"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such	209:232,36A  !
5A	an Anne Cox should be."	209:232,37A  !
5M	"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there.	209:232,38M  !
5M	He sat by her at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the	209:233, 1M  !
5M	Coxes would be very glad to marry him."	209:233, 2M  !
5A	"Very likely.~ I think they are, without exception, the	209:233, 3A  !
5A	most vulgar girls in Highbury."	209:233, 4A  !
5O	"For my companion tells me,"	209:234, 1O  !
5O	"that I absolutely	209:234, 1O  !
5O	promised Miss Bates last night, that I would come	209:234, 2O  !
5O	this morning. I was not aware of it myself. I did not	209:234, 3O  !
5O	know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I am	209:234, 4O  !
5O	going now."	209:234, 5O  !
5E	"And while Mrs% Weston pays her visit, I may be	209:234, 6E  !
5E	allowed, I hope,"	209:234, 7E  !
5E	"to join your	209:234, 7E  !
5E	party and wait for her at Hartfield~ if you are going	209:234, 8E  !
5E	home."	209:234, 9E  !
5O	"I thought you meant to go with me. They would be	209:234,11O  !
5O	very much pleased."	209:234,12O  !
5E	"Me| I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps~	209:234,13E  !
5E	I may be equally in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks	209:234,14E  !
5E	as if she did not want me. My aunt always sends me off	209:234,15E  !
5E	when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death;	209:234,16E  !
5E	and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the	209:234,17E  !
5E	same. What am I to do?"	209:234,18E  !
5A	"I am here on no business of my own,"	209:234,19A  !
5A	"I am only waiting for my friend. She will probably	209:234,20A  !
5A	have soon done, and then we shall go home. But you had	209:234,21A  !
5A	better go with Mrs% Weston and hear the instrument."	209:234,22A  !
5E	"Well~ if you advise it.~ But	209:234,23E  !
5E	if Col% Campbell	209:234,23E  !
5E	should have employed a careless friend, and if	209:234,24E  !
5E	it should prove to have an indifferent tone~ what shall I	209:234,25E  !
5E	say? I shall be no support to Mrs% Weston. She might	209:234,26E  !
5E	do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be	209:234,27E  !
5E	palateable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest	209:234,28E  !
5E	being in the world at a civil falsehood."	209:234,29E  !
5A	"I do not believe any such thing,"	209:234,30A  !
5A	"I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your	209:234,31A  !
5A	neighbours, when it is necessary; but there is no reason	209:234,32A  !
5A	to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite otherwise	209:234,33A  !
5A	indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night."	209:234,34A  !
5O	"Do come with me,"	209:234,35O  !
5O	"if it be not	209:234,35O  !
5O	very disagreeable to you. It need not detain us long. We	209:234,36O  !
5O	will go to Hartfield afterwards. We will follow them to	209:234,37O  !
5O	Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It will be	209:234,38O  !
5O	felt so great an attention| and I always thought you	209:235, 1O  !
5O	meant it."	209:235, 2O  !
5M	"Yes ~ no~ yes, to Mrs% Goddard's. Only	209:235,13M  !
5M	my pattern gown is at Hartfield. No, you shall send it to	209:235,14M  !
5M	Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs% Goddard will	209:235,15M  !
5M	want to see it.~ And I could take the pattern gown home	209:235,16M  !
5M	any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly~ so it had	209:235,17M  !
5M	better go to Hartfield~ at least the ribbon. You could	209:235,18M  !
5M	make it into two parcels, Mrs% Ford, could not you?"	209:235,19M  !
5A	"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs% Ford the	209:235,20A  !
5A	trouble of two parcels."	209:235,21A  !
5M	"No more it is."	209:235,22M  !
5M	"Oh| but indeed I would much rather have it only in	209:235,25M  !
5M	one. Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs% Goddard's~	209:235,26M  !
5M	I do not know~ No, I think, Miss Woodhouse,	209:235,27M  !
5M	I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and take it	209:235,28M  !
5M	home with me at night. What do you advise?"	209:235,29M  !
5A	"That you do not give another half-second to the	209:235,30A  !
5A	subject. To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs% Ford."	209:235,31A  !
5M	"Aye, that will be much best,"	209:235,32M  !
5M	"I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs% Goddard's."	209:235,33M  !
5D	"My dear Miss Woodhouse,"	209:235,38D  !
5D	"I am	209:235,38D  !
5D	just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and	209:236, 1D  !
5D	sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion	209:236, 2D  !
5D	of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How do	209:236, 3D  !
5D	you do, Miss Smith?~ Very well I thank you.~ And I	209:236, 4D  !
5D	begged Mrs% Weston to come with me, that I might be	209:236, 5D  !
5D	sure of succeeding."	209:236, 6D  !
5A	"I hope Mrs% Bates and Miss Fairfax are"~	209:236, 7A  !
5D	"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is	209:236, 8D  !
5D	delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night.	209:236, 9D  !
5D	How is Mr% Woodhouse?~ I am so glad to hear such a good	209:236,10D  !
5D	account. Mrs% Weston told me you were here.~ Oh| then,	209:236,11D  !
5D	said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will	209:236,12D  !
5D	allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in;	209:236,13D  !
5D	my mother will be so very happy to see her~ and now we	209:236,14D  !
5D	are such a nice party, she cannot refuse.	209:236,15D  !
5D	said Mr% Frank Churchill,	209:236,16D  !
5D	But, said I, I shall	209:236,17D  !
5D	be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.	209:236,18D  !
5D	said he,	209:236,19D  !
5E	my job.""~	209:236,20E  !
5D	For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse,	209:236,20D  !
5D	there he is, in the most obliging manner in the world,	209:236,21D  !
5D	fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.~ The	209:236,22D  !
5D	rivet came out, you know, this morning.~ So very obliging|	209:236,23D  !
5D	~ For my mother had no use of her spectacles~ could	209:236,24D  !
5D	not put them on. And, by the bye, every body ought to	209:236,25D  !
5D	have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane	209:236,26D  !
5D	said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the	209:236,27D  !
5D	first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all	209:236,28D  !
5D	the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no	209:236,29D  !
5D	saying what, you know. At one time Patty came to say	209:236,30D  !
5D	she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh|	209:236,31D  !
5D	said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me.	209:236,32D  !
5D	Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. Then	209:236,33D  !
5D	the baked apples came home, Mrs% Wallis sent them by	209:236,34D  !
5D	her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the	209:236,35D  !
5D	Wallises, always~ I have heard some people say that	209:236,36D  !
5D	Mrs% Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,	209:236,37D  !
5D	but we have never known any thing but the greatest	209:236,38D  !
5D	attention from them. And it cannot be for the value of	209:237, 1D  !
5D	our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread,	209:237, 2D  !
5D	you know? Only three of us~ besides dear Jane at	209:237, 3D  !
5D	present~ and she really eats nothing~ makes such a	209:237, 4D  !
5D	shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you	209:237, 5D  !
5D	saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she	209:237, 6D  !
5D	eats~ so I say one thing and then I say another, and it	209:237, 7D  !
5D	passes off. But about the middle of the day she gets	209:237, 8D  !
5D	hungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these	209:237, 9D  !
5D	baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I	209:237,10D  !
5D	took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr% Perry;	209:237,11D  !
5D	I happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any	209:237,12D  !
5D	doubt before~ I have so often heard Mr% Woodhouse recommend	209:237,13D  !
5D	a baked apple. I believe it is the only way that	209:237,14D  !
5D	Mr% Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome.	209:237,15D  !
5D	We have apple dumplings, however, very often. Patty	209:237,16D  !
5D	makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs% Weston,	209:237,17D  !
5D	you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us."	209:237,18D  !
5D	"How do you do, Mrs% Ford? I beg your pardon. I	209:237,22D  !
5D	did not see you before. I hear you have a charming	209:237,23D  !
5D	collection of new ribbons from town. Jane came back	209:237,24D  !
5D	delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well	209:237,25D  !
5D	~ only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is	209:237,26D  !
5D	taking them in."	209:237,27D  !
5D	"What was I talking of?"	209:237,28D  !
5D	"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.~	209:237,32D  !
5D	Oh| my mother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr% Frank Churchill|	209:237,33D  !
5D	said he,	209:237,34D  !
5D	Which you know shewed him to be so very~~ Indeed	209:237,36D  !
5D	I must say that, much as I had heard of him before and	209:237,37D  !
5D	much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any thing ~~	209:237,38D  !
5D	I do congratulate you, Mrs% Weston, most warmly. He	209:238, 1D  !
5D	seems every thing the fondest parent could~~	209:238, 2D  !
5D	said he,	209:238, 3D  !
5D	I never shall forget his manner. And when	209:238, 4D  !
5D	I brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped	209:238, 5D  !
5D	our friends would be so very obliging as to take some,	209:238, 6D  !
5D	said he, directly,	209:238, 7D  !
5D	That, you know, was	209:238, 9D  !
5D	so very~~ And I am sure, by his manner, it was no	209:238,10D  !
5D	compliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and	209:238,11D  !
5D	Mrs% Wallis does them full justice~ only we do not have	209:238,12D  !
5D	them baked more than twice, and Mr% Woodhouse made	209:238,13D  !
5D	us promise to have them done three times~ but Miss Woodhouse	209:238,14D  !
5D	will be so good as not to mention it. The	209:238,15D  !
5D	apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking,	209:238,16D  !
5D	beyond a doubt; all from Donwell~ some of Mr% Knightley's	209:238,17D  !
5D	most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year;	209:238,18D  !
5D	and certainly there never was such a keeping apple any where	209:238,19D  !
5D	as one of his trees~ I believe there is two of them.	209:238,20D  !
5D	My mother says the orchard was always famous in her	209:238,21D  !
5D	younger days. But I was really quite shocked the other	209:238,22D  !
5D	day~ for Mr% Knightley called one morning, and Jane was	209:238,23D  !
5D	eating these apples, and we talked about them and said	209:238,24D  !
5D	how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we	209:238,25D  !
5D	were not got to the end of our stock.	209:238,26D  !
5D	said he,	209:238,27D  !
5D	So I begged he would not~ for really as to ours	209:238,31D  !
5D	being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great	209:238,32D  !
5D	many left~ it was but half a dozen indeed; but they	209:238,33D  !
5D	should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear	209:238,34D  !
5D	that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had	209:238,35D  !
5D	been already; and Jane said the same. And when he	209:238,36D  !
5D	was gone, she almost quarrelled with me~ No, I should not	209:238,37D  !
5D	say quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives;	209:238,38D  !
5D	but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples	209:239, 1D  !
5D	were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe	209:239, 2D  !
5D	we had a great many left. Oh| said I, my dear, I did	209:239, 3D  !
5D	say as much as I could. However, the very same evening	209:239, 4D  !
5D	William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples,	209:239, 5D  !
5D	the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very	209:239, 6D  !
5D	much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins	209:239, 7D  !
5D	and said every thing, as you may suppose.	209:239, 8D  !
5D	William Larkins is such an old acquaintance| I am always	209:239, 9D  !
5D	glad to see him. But, however, I found afterwards from	209:239,10D  !
5D	Patty, that William said it was all the apples of \that\ sort	209:239,11D  !
5D	his master had; he had brought them all~ and now his	209:239,12D  !
5D	master had not one left to bake or boil. William did not	209:239,13D  !
5D	seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his	209:239,14D  !
5D	master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks	209:239,15D  !
5D	more of his master's profit than any thing; but Mrs% Hodges,	209:239,16D  !
5D	he said, was quite displeased at their being all	209:239,17D  !
5D	sent away. She could not bear that her master should	209:239,18D  !
5D	not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. He	209:239,19D  !
5D	told Patty this, but bid her not mind it, and be sure not	209:239,20D  !
5D	to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs% Hodges \would\ be	209:239,21D  !
5D	cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold,	209:239,22D  !
5D	it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty	209:239,23D  !
5D	told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed| I would	209:239,24D  !
5D	not have Mr% Knightley know any thing about it for the	209:239,25D  !
5D	world| He would be so very~~ I wanted to keep it from	209:239,26D  !
5D	Jane's knowledge; but unluckily, I had mentioned it	209:239,27D  !
5D	before I was aware."	209:239,28D  !
5D	"Pray take care, Mrs% Weston, there is a step at the	209:239,33D  !
5D	turning. Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather	209:239,34D  !
5D	a dark staircase~ rather darker and narrower than one	209:239,35D  !
5D	could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss Woodhouse,	209:239,36D  !
5D	I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss Smith,	209:239,37D  !
5D	the step at the turning."	209:239,38D  !
5E	"This is a pleasure,"	210:240,10E  !
5E	"coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.	210:240,11E  !
5E	You find me trying to be useful; tell me if you think I	210:240,12E  !
5E	shall succeed."	210:240,13E  !
5O	"What|"	210:240,14O  !
5O	"have not you finished	210:240,14O  !
5O	it yet? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a	210:240,15O  !
5O	working-silversmith at this rate."	210:240,16O  !
5E	"I have not been working uninterruptedly,"	210:240,17E  !
5E	"I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her	210:240,18E  !
5E	instrument stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness	210:240,19E  !
5E	in the floor, I believe. You see we have been	210:240,20E  !
5E	wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you	210:240,21E  !
5E	to be persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would	210:240,22E  !
5E	be hurrying home."	210:240,23E  !
5E	"Whoever Col% Campbell might employ,"	210:241,10E  !
5E	"the person has not	210:241,11E  !
5E	chosen ill. I heard a good deal of Col% Campbell's taste	210:241,12E  !
5E	at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes	210:241,13E  !
5E	I am sure is exactly what he and \all\ \that\ \party\ would	210:241,14E  !
5E	particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he	210:241,15E  !
5E	either gave his friend very minute directions, or wrote	210:241,16E  !
5E	to Broadwood himself. Do not you think so?"	210:241,17E  !
5A	"It is not fair,"	210:241,21A  !
5A	"mine was	210:241,21A  !
5A	a random guess. Do not distress her."	210:241,22A  !
5E	"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying	210:241,26E  !
5E	your pleasure on this occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say	210:241,27E  !
5E	they often think of you, and wonder which will be the	210:241,28E  !
5E	day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to hand.	210:241,29E  !
5E	Do you imagine Col% Campbell knows the business to be	210:241,30E  !
5E	going forward just at this time?~ Do you imagine it to	210:241,31E  !
5E	be the consequence of an immediate commission from	210:241,32E  !
5E	him, or that he may have sent only a general direction,	210:241,33E  !
5E	an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon contingencies	210:241,34E  !
5E	and conveniences?"	210:241,35E  !
5E	"Conjecture~ aye, sometimes one conjectures right,	210:242, 3E  !
5E	and sometimes one conjectures wrong. I wish I could	210:242, 4E  !
5E	conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm.	210:242, 5E  !
5E	What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at	210:242, 6E  !
5E	work, if one talks at all;~ your real workmen, I suppose,	210:242, 7E  !
5E	hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get	210:242, 8E  !
5E	hold of a word~ Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.	210:242, 9E  !
5E	There, it is done. I have the pleasure, madam,	210:242,10E  !
5E	of restoring your spectacles, healed for	210:242,11E  !
5E	the present."	210:242,12E  !
5E	"If you are very kind,"	210:242,17E  !
5E	"it will be one of the	210:242,17E  !
5E	waltzes we danced last night;~ let me live them over	210:242,18E  !
5E	again. You did not enjoy them as I did; you appeared	210:242,19E  !
5E	tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we danced	210:242,20E  !
5E	no longer; but I would have given worlds~ all the worlds	210:242,21E  !
5E	one ever has to give~ for another half hour."	210:242,22E  !
5E	"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which \has\	210:242,24E  !
5E	made one happy|~ If I mistake not that was danced at	210:242,25E  !
5E	Weymouth."	210:242,26E  !
5E	"Here is something quite new to me. Do you know	210:242,30E  !
5E	it?~ Cramer.~ And here are a new set of Irish melodies.	210:242,31E  !
5E	That, from such a quarter, one might expect. This was	210:242,32E  !
5E	all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of Col% Campbell,	210:242,33E  !
5E	was not it?~ He knew Miss Fairfax could	210:242,34E  !
5E	have no music here. I honour that part of the attention	210:242,35E  !
5E	particularly; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from	210:242,36E  !
5E	the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing incomplete.	210:242,37E  !
5E	True affection only could have prompted it."	210:242,38E  !
5A	"You speak too plain. She must understand you."	210:243,13A  !
5E	"I hope she does. I would have her understand me.	210:243,14E  !
5E	I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning."	210:243,15E  !
5A	"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never	210:243,16A  !
5A	taken up the idea."	210:243,17A  !
5E	"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated	210:243,18E  !
5E	it to me. I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways.	210:243,19E  !
5E	Leave shame to her. If she does wrong, she ought to	210:243,20E  !
5E	feel it."	210:243,21E  !
5A	"She is not entirely without it, I think."	210:243,22A  !
5E	"I do not see much sign of it. She is playing \Robin Adair\	210:243,23E  !
5E	at this moment~ \his\ favourite."	210:243,24E  !
5D	"Mr% Knightley I declare|~ I must speak to him if	210:243,27D  !
5D	possible, just to thank him. I will not open the window	210:243,28D  !
5D	here; it would give you all cold; but I can go into my	210:243,29D  !
5D	mother's room you know. I dare say he will come in	210:243,30D  !
5D	when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have	210:243,31D  !
5D	you all meet so|~ Our little room so honoured|"	210:243,32D  !
5D	"How d'ye do?~ how d'ye do?~ Very well, I thank	210:243,38D  !
5D	you. So obliged to you for the carriage last night. We	210:244, 1D  !
5D	were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray	210:244, 2D  !
5D	come in; do come in. You will find some friends here."	210:244, 3D  !
5B	"How is your niece, Miss Bates?~ I want to inquire	210:244, 7B  !
5B	after you all, but particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?~	210:244, 8B  !
5B	I hope she caught no cold last night. How is	210:244, 9B  !
5B	she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is."	210:244,10B  !
5D	"So obliged to you|~ so very much obliged to you	210:244,16D  !
5D	for the carriage,"	210:244,17D  !
5B	"I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for	210:244,19B  !
5B	you?"	210:244,20B  !
5D	"Oh| dear, Kingston~ are you?~ Mrs% Cole was saying	210:244,21D  !
5D	the other day she wanted something from Kingston."	210:244,22D  !
5B	"Mrs% Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing	210:244,23B  !
5B	for \you\?"	210:244,24B  !
5D	"No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you	210:244,25D  !
5D	think is here?~ Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so	210:244,26D  !
5D	kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte=. Do put up	210:244,27D  !
5D	your horse at the Crown, and come in."	210:244,28D  !
5B	"Well,"	210:244,29B  !
5B	"for five	210:244,29B  !
5B	minutes, perhaps."	210:244,30B  !
5D	"And here is Mrs% Weston and Mr% Frank Churchill	210:244,31D  !
5D	too|~ Quite delightful; so many friends|"	210:244,32D  !
5B	"No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two	210:244,33B  !
5B	minutes. I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can."	210:244,34B  !
5D	"Oh| do come in. They will be so very happy to	210:244,35D  !
5D	see you."	210:244,36D  !
5B	"No, no, your room is full enough. I will call another	210:244,37B  !
5B	day, and hear the pianoforte=."	210:244,38B  !
5D	"Well, I am so sorry|~ Oh| Mr% Knightley, what	210:245, 1D  !
5D	a delightful party last night; how extremely pleasant.~	210:245, 2D  !
5D	Did you ever see such dancing?~ Was not it delightful?	210:245, 3D  !
5D	~ Miss Woodhouse and Mr% Frank Churchill; I never	210:245, 4D  !
5D	saw any thing equal to it."	210:245, 5D  !
5B	"Oh| very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less,	210:245, 6B  !
5B	for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr% Frank Churchill	210:245, 7B  !
5B	are hearing every thing that passes. And	210:245, 8B  !
5B	I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not	210:245, 9B  !
5B	be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well;	210:245,10B  !
5B	and Mrs% Weston is the very best country-dance player,	210:245,11B  !
5B	without exception, in England. Now, if your friends have	210:245,12B  !
5B	any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about	210:245,13B  !
5B	you and me in return; but I cannot stay to hear it."	210:245,14B  !
5D	"Oh| Mr% Knightley, one moment more; something	210:245,15D  !
5D	of consequence~ so shocked|~ Jane and I are both so	210:245,16D  !
5D	shocked about the apples|"	210:245,17D  !
5B	"What is the matter now?"	210:245,18B  !
5D	"To think of your sending us all your store apples.	210:245,19D  !
5D	You said you had a great many, and now you have not	210:245,20D  !
5D	one left. We really are so shocked| Mrs% Hodges may	210:245,21D  !
5D	well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You	210:245,22D  !
5D	should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah|	210:245,23D  !
5D	he is off. He never can bear to be thanked. But I thought	210:245,24D  !
5D	he would have staid now, and it would have been a pity	210:245,25D  !
5D	not to have mentioned ~~ Well,	210:245,26D  !
5D	I have not been able to succeed. Mr% Knightley	210:245,27D  !
5D	cannot stop. He is going to Kingston. He asked me if	210:245,28D  !
5D	he could do any thing" ~~	210:245,29D  !
5D	"Oh| yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you	210:245,32D  !
5D	know the door was open, and the window was open, and	210:245,33D  !
5D	Mr% Knightley spoke loud. You must have heard everything	210:245,34D  !
5D	to be sure.	210:245,35D  !
5D	said he, so I just mentioned ~~ Oh| Miss Woodhouse,	210:245,36D  !
5D	must you be going?~ You seem but just come~ so very	210:245,37D  !
5D	obliging of you."	210:245,38D  !
5E	"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three,	211:248, 5E  !
5E	and the two Miss Coxes five,"	211:248, 6E  !
5E	"And there will be the two Gilberts, young	211:248, 7E  !
5E	Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr% Knightley. Yes,	211:248, 8E  !
5E	that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith,	211:248, 9E  !
5E	and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes	211:248,10E  !
5E	five; and for five couple there will be plenty of	211:248,11E  !
5E	room."	211:248,12E  !
5A	"But will there be good room for five couple?~ I really	211:248,14A  !
5A	do not think there will."	211:248,15A  !
5E	"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it	211:248,17E  !
5E	worth while to stand up. Five couple are nothing, when	211:248,18E  !
5E	one thinks seriously about it. It will not do to \invite\	211:248,19E  !
5E	five couple. It can be allowable only as the thought of	211:248,20E  !
5E	the moment."	211:248,21E  !
5E	"Might not they use both rooms, and dance	211:248,33E  !
5E	across the passage?"	211:248,34E  !
5P	"Oh| no,"	211:249, 3P  !
5P	"it would be the extreme of	211:249, 3P  !
5P	imprudence. I could not bear it for Emma|~ Emma is	211:249, 4P  !
5P	not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold. So would	211:249, 5P  !
5P	poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs% Weston, you	211:249, 6P  !
5P	would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such	211:249, 7P  !
5P	a wild thing. Pray do not let them talk of it. That	211:249, 8P  !
5P	young man	211:249, 9P  !
5P	is very thoughtless. Do not	211:249, 9P  !
5P	tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing.	211:249,10P  !
5P	He has been opening the doors very often this evening,	211:249,11P  !
5P	and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does	211:249,12P  !
5P	not think of the draught. I do not mean to set you against	211:249,13P  !
5P	him, but indeed he is not quite the thing|"	211:249,14P  !
5E	"We were too magnificent,"	211:249,24E  !
5E	"We allowed	211:249,24E  !
5E	unnecessary room. Ten couple may stand here very well."	211:249,25E  !
5A	"It would be a crowd~ a sad crowd;	211:249,26A  !
5A	and what could be worse than dancing without space to	211:249,27A  !
5A	turn in?"	211:249,28A  !
5E	"Very true,"	211:249,29E  !
5E	"it was very bad."	211:249,29E  !
5E	"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten	211:249,31E  !
5E	couple."	211:249,32E  !
5A	"No, no,"	211:249,33A  !
5A	"you are quite unreasonable. It	211:249,33A  !
5A	would be dreadful to be standing so close| Nothing can	211:249,34A  !
5A	be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd~	211:249,35A  !
5A	and a crowd in a little room|"	211:249,36A  !
5E	"There is no denying it,"	211:249,37E  !
5E	"I agree with	211:249,37E  !
5E	you exactly. A crowd in a little room~ Miss Woodhouse,	211:249,38E  !
5E	you have the art of giving pictures in a few words.	211:250, 1E  !
5E	Exquisite, quite exquisite|~ Still, however, having proceeded	211:250, 2E  !
5E	so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It	211:250, 3E  !
5E	would be a disappointment to my father~ and altogether	211:250, 4E  !
5E	~ I do not know that~ I am rather of opinion that ten	211:250, 5E  !
5E	couple might stand here very well."	211:250, 6E  !
5E	"Well, Miss Woodhouse,"	211:250,20E  !
5E	"your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened	211:250,21E  !
5E	away, I hope, by the terrors of my father's little	211:250,22E  !
5E	rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:~ a	211:250,23E  !
5E	thought of my father's, which waits only your approbation	211:250,24E  !
5E	to be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your	211:250,25E  !
5E	hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball,	211:250,26E  !
5E	to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?"	211:250,27E  !
5A	"The Crown|"	211:250,28A  !
5E	"Yes; if you and Mr% Woodhouse see no objection,	211:250,29E  !
5E	and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his friends will	211:250,30E  !
5E	be so kind as to visit him there. Better accommodations,	211:250,31E  !
5E	he can promise them, and not a less grateful welcome than	211:250,32E  !
5E	at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs% Weston sees no	211:250,33E  !
5E	objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what	211:250,34E  !
5E	we all feel. Oh| you were perfectly right| Ten couple,	211:250,35E  !
5E	in either of the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable|~	211:250,36E  !
5E	Dreadful|~ I felt how right you were the	211:250,37E  !
5E	whole time, but was too anxious for securing \any thing\	211:250,38E  !
5E	to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?~ You consent	211:251, 1E  !
5E	~ I hope you consent?"	211:251, 2E  !
5A	"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to,	211:251, 3A  !
5A	if Mr% and Mrs% Weston do not. I think it admirable;	211:251, 4A  !
5A	and, as far as I can answer for myself, shall be most happy	211:251, 5A  !
5A	~~ It seems the only improvement that could be.	211:251, 6A  !
5A	Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?"	211:251, 7A  !
5P	"No; he thought it very far from an improvement ~	211:251,11P  !
5P	a very bad plan~ much worse than the other. A room	211:251,12P  !
5P	at an inn was always damp and dangerous; never properly	211:251,13P  !
5P	aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance,	211:251,14P  !
5P	they had better dance at Randalls. He had never been	211:251,15P  !
5P	in the room at the Crown in his life~ did not know the	211:251,16P  !
5P	people who kept it by sight.~ Oh| no~ a very bad plan.	211:251,17P  !
5P	They would catch worse colds at the Crown than any where."	211:251,18P  !
5E	"I was going to observe, sir,"	211:251,20E  !
5E	"that one of the great recommendations of this change	211:251,21E  !
5E	would be the very little danger of any body's catching	211:251,22E  !
5E	cold~ so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls|	211:251,23E  !
5E	Mr% Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but	211:251,24E  !
5E	nobody else could."	211:251,25E  !
5P	"Sir,"	211:251,26P  !
5P	"you are	211:251,26P  !
5P	very much mistaken if you suppose Mr% Perry to be that	211:251,27P  !
5P	sort of character. Mr% Perry is extremely concerned	211:251,28P  !
5P	when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how the	211:251,29P  !
5P	room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's	211:251,30P  !
5P	house."	211:251,31P  !
5E	"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir.	211:251,32E  !
5E	We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all~	211:251,33E  !
5E	not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of	211:251,34E  !
5E	opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies,	211:251,35E  !
5E	which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."	211:251,36E  !
5P	"Open the windows|~ but surely, Mr% Churchill, nobody	211:251,37P  !
5P	would think of opening the windows at Randalls.	211:251,38P  !
5P	Nobody could be so imprudent| I never heard of such	211:252, 1P  !
5P	a thing. Dancing with open windows|~ I am sure,	211:252, 2P  !
5P	neither your father nor Mrs% Weston (poor Miss Taylor	211:252, 3P  !
5P	that was) would suffer it."	211:252, 4P  !
5E	"Ah| sir~ but a thoughtless young person will sometimes	211:252, 5E  !
5E	step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash,	211:252, 6E  !
5E	without its being suspected. I have often known it done	211:252, 7E  !
5E	myself."	211:252, 8E  !
5P	"Have you indeed, sir?~ Bless me| I never could	211:252, 9P  !
5P	have supposed it. But I live out of the world, and am	211:252,10P  !
5P	often astonished at what I hear. However, this does	211:252,11P  !
5P	make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk	211:252,12P  !
5P	it over~ but these sort of things require a good deal of	211:252,13P  !
5P	consideration. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.	211:252,14P  !
5P	If Mr% and Mrs% Weston will be so obliging as to call here	211:252,15P  !
5P	one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be	211:252,16P  !
5P	done."	211:252,17P  !
5E	"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited~~"	211:252,18E  !
5A	"Oh|"	211:252,19A  !
5A	"there will be plenty of	211:252,19A  !
5A	time for talking every thing over. There is no hurry at	211:252,20A  !
5A	all. If it can be contrived to be at the Crown, papa, it	211:252,21A  !
5A	will be very convenient for the horses. They will be so	211:252,22A  !
5A	near their own stable."	211:252,23A  !
5P	"So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not	211:252,24P  !
5P	that James ever complains; but it is right to spare our	211:252,25P  !
5P	horses when we can. If I could be sure of the rooms being	211:252,26P  !
5P	thoroughly aired~ but is Mrs% Stokes to be trusted? I	211:252,27P  !
5P	doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight."	211:252,28P  !
5E	"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir,	211:252,29E  !
5E	because it will be under Mrs% Weston's care. Mrs% Weston	211:252,30E  !
5E	undertakes to direct the whole."	211:252,31E  !
5A	"There, papa|~ Now you must be satisfied~ Our own	211:252,32A  !
5A	dear Mrs% Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you	211:252,33A  !
5A	remember what Mr% Perry said, so many years ago, when	211:252,34A  !
5A	I had the measles?	211:252,35A  !
5A	How	211:252,36A  !
5A	often I have heard you speak of it as such a compliment	211:252,37A  !
5A	to her|"	211:252,38A  !
5P	"Aye, very true. Mr% Perry did say so. I shall never	211:253, 1P  !
5P	forget it. Poor little Emma| You were very bad with	211:253, 2P  !
5P	the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but	211:253, 3P  !
5P	for Perry's great attention. He came four times a day	211:253, 4P  !
5P	for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort	211:253, 5P  !
5P	~ which was our great comfort; but the measles are a	211:253, 6P  !
5P	dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's	211:253, 7P  !
5P	little ones have the measles, she will send for Perry.	211:253, 8P  !
5E	"My father and Mrs% Weston are at the Crown at this	211:253, 9E  !
5E	moment,"	211:253,10E  !
5E	"examining the capabilities	211:253,10E  !
5E	of the house. I left them there and came on to	211:253,11E  !
5E	Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you	211:253,12E  !
5E	might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on	211:253,13E  !
5E	the spot. I was desired to say so from both. It would be	211:253,14E  !
5E	the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to	211:253,15E  !
5E	attend you there. They can do nothing satisfactorily	211:253,16E  !
5E	without you."	211:253,17E  !
5O	"Emma,"	211:253,25O  !
5O	"this paper is worse than I expected.	211:253,25O  !
5O	Look| in places you see it is dreadfully dirty;	211:253,26O  !
5O	and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing	211:253,27O  !
5O	I could have imagined."	211:253,28O  !
5N	"My dear, you are too particular,"	211:253,29N  !
5N	"What does all that signify? You will see nothing of it	211:253,30N  !
5N	by candle-light. It will be as clean as Randalls by candle-light.	211:253,31N  !
5N	We never see any thing of it on our club-nights."	211:253,32N  !
5O	"I do not think it \is\ so very small. We shall not be	211:254,23O  !
5O	many, you know."	211:254,24O  !
5N	"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage,	211:254,27N  !
5N	my dear. It is a mere nothing after all; and not the	211:254,28N  !
5N	least draught from the stairs."	211:254,29N  !

5E	"Yes, very true,"	211:254,34E  !
5E	"very true. You want	211:254,34E  !

5E	one could ascertain what the chief of them~ the Coles, for	211:254,36E  !
5E	instance. They are not far off. Shall I call upon them?	211:254,37E  !
5E	Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.~And I do not know	211:254,38E  !
5E	whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the	211:255, 1E  !
5E	inclinations of the rest of the people as any body. I think	211:255, 2E  !
5E	we do want a larger council. Suppose I go and invite	211:255, 3E  !
5E	Miss Bates to join us?"	211:255, 4E  !
5O	"Well~ if you please,"	211:255, 5O  !
5O	"if you think she will be of any use."	211:255, 6O  !
5A	"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,"	211:255, 7A  !
5A	"She will be all delight and gratitude, but	211:255, 8A  !
5A	she will tell you nothing. She will not even listen to your	211:255, 9A  !
5A	questions. I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates."	211:255,10A  !
5E	"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing| I am	211:255,11E  !
5E	very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk. And I need not	211:255,12E  !
5E	bring the whole family, you know."	211:255,13E  !
5N	"Aye, do, Frank.~ Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us	211:255,16N  !
5N	end the matter at once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am	211:255,17N  !
5N	sure; and I do not know a properer person for shewing	211:255,18N  !
5N	us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates. We	211:255,19N  !
5N	are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of	211:255,20N  !
5N	how to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them	211:255,21N  !
5N	both."	211:255,22N  !
5E	"Both sir| Can the old lady?"~~	211:255,23E  !
5N	"The old lady| No, the young lady, to be sure. I	211:255,24N  !
5N	shall think you a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring	211:255,25N  !
5N	the aunt without the niece."	211:255,26N  !
5E	"Oh| I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately	211:255,27E  !
5E	recollect. Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour	211:255,28E  !
5E	to persuade them both."	211:255,29E  !
5N	"He has	211:256,16N  !
5N	asked her, my dear. That's right. I knew he would|"	211:256,17N  !
5B	"Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be	212:257,26B  !
5B	at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment,	212:257,27B  !
5B	I have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not	212:257,28B  !
5B	choose pleasures for me.~ Oh| yes, I must be there; I	212:257,29B  !
5B	could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can;	212:257,30B  !
5B	but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's	212:257,31B  !
5B	week's account; much rather, I confess.~	212:257,32B  !
5B	Pleasure in seeing dancing|~ not I, indeed~ I never look	212:257,33B  !
5B	at it~ I do not know who does.~ Fine dancing, I believe,	212:258, 1B  !
5B	like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing	212:258, 2B  !
5B	by are usually thinking of something very different."	212:258, 3B  !

5O	of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any	212:259, 1O  !
5O	interest in him; and that he might be expected at Hartfield	212:259, 2O  !
5O	very soon."	212:259, 3O  !
5A	"I said it would be so,"	212:259,10A  !
5E	"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."	212:259,24E  !
5A	"But you will come again,"	212:259,25A  !
5A	"This will	212:259,25A  !
5A	not be your only visit to Randalls."	212:259,26A  !
5E	"Ah|~	212:259,27E  !
5E	the uncertainty of when	212:259,27E  !
5E	I may be able to return|~ I shall try for it with a zeal|~	212:259,28E  !
5E	It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares|~ and	212:259,29E  !
5E	if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring~ but I am	212:259,30E  !
5E	afraid~ they did not stir last spring~ I am afraid it is	212:259,31E  !
5E	a custom gone for ever."	212:259,32E  !

5E	"Ah| that ball|~ why did we wait for any thing?~	212:259,34E  !
5E	why not seize the pleasure at once?~ How often is happiness	212:259,35E  !
5E	destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation|~	212:259,36E  !
5E	You told us it would be so.~ Oh| Miss Woodhouse, why	212:259,37E  !
5E	are you always so right?"	212:259,38E  !
5A	"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance.	212:260, 1A  !
5A	I would much rather have been merry than wise."	212:260, 2A  !
5E	"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My	212:260, 3E  !
5E	father depends on it. Do not forget your engagement."	212:260, 4E  !
5E	"Such a fortnight as it has been|"	212:260, 6E  !
5E	"every day more precious and more delightful than the	212:260, 7E  !
5E	day before|~ every day making me less fit to bear my	212:260, 8E  !
5E	other place. Happy those, who can remain at Highbury|"	212:260, 9E  !
5A	"As you do us such ample justice now,"	212:260,10A  !
5A	"I will venture to ask, whether you did not	212:260,11A  !
5A	come a little doubtingly at first? Do not we rather	212:260,12A  !
5A	surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure	212:260,13A  !
5A	you did not much expect to like us. You would not have	212:260,14A  !
5A	been so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of	212:260,15A  !
5A	Highbury."	212:260,16A  !

5E	"Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk	212:260,20E  !
5E	back together, and I must be off immediately. I am	212:260,21E  !
5E	almost afraid that every moment will bring him."	212:260,22E  !
5A	"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax	212:260,23A  !
5A	and Miss Bates? How unlucky| Miss Bates's	212:260,24A  !
5A	powerful, argumentative mind might have strengthened	212:260,25A  !
5A	yours."	212:260,26A  !
5E	"Yes~ I \have\ called there; passing the door, I thought	212:260,27E  !
5E	it better. It was a right thing to do. I went in for three	212:260,28E  !
5E	minutes, and was detained by Miss Bates's being absent.	212:260,29E  !
5E	She was out; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she	212:260,30E  !
5E	came in. She is a woman that one may, that one \must\	212:260,31E  !
5E	laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was	212:260,32E  !
5E	better to pay my visit, then"~	212:260,33E  !
5E	"In short,"	212:260,35E  !
5E	"perhaps, Miss Woodhouse~	212:260,35E  !
5E	I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion"~	212:260,36E  !
5A	"You were quite in the right; it was most natural to	212:261, 4A  !
5A	pay your visit, then"~	212:261, 5A  !
5E	"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time	212:261,13E  !
5E	might be given to Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is	212:261,14E  !
5E	most warm"~	212:261,15E  !
5N	"It was time to go;"	212:261,26N  !
5E	"I shall hear about you all,"	212:261,29E  !
5E	"that is my	212:261,29E  !
5E	chief consolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going	212:261,30E  !
5E	on among you. I have engaged Mrs% Weston to correspond	212:261,31E  !
5E	with me. She has been so kind as to promise it. Oh| the	212:261,32E  !
5E	blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really	212:261,33E  !
5E	interested in the absent|~ she will tell me every thing.	212:261,34E  !
5E	In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again."	212:261,35E  !
5E	"Good bye,"	212:261,36E  !
5A	"I certainly must,"	212:262,21A  !
5A	"This sensation of	212:262,21A  !
5A	listlessness, weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit	212:262,22A  !
5A	down and employ myself, this feeling of every thing's	212:262,23A  !
5A	being dull and insipid about the house|~ I must be in	212:262,24A  !
5A	love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if	212:262,25A  !
5A	I were not~ for a few weeks at least. Well| evil to some	212:262,26A  !
5A	is always good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners	212:262,27A  !
5A	for the ball, if not for Frank Churchill; but	212:262,28A  !
5A	Mr% Knightley will be happy. He may spend the evening	212:262,29A  !
5A	with his dear William Larkins now if he likes."	212:262,30A  !
5B	"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing,	212:262,37B  !

5A	my delicate negatives, is there any allusion to making	213:264,30A  !
5A	a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not really necessary to	213:264,31A  !
5A	my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will not	213:264,32A  !
5A	persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite	213:265, 1A  !
5A	enough in love. I should be sorry to be more."	213:265, 2A  !
5A	"\He\ is undoubtedly very much in love~ every thing	213:265, 5A  !
5A	denotes it~ very much in love indeed|~ and when he	213:265, 6A  !
5A	comes again, if his affection continue, I must be on my	213:265, 7A  !
5A	guard not to encourage it.~ It would be most inexcusable	213:265, 8A  !
5A	to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not	213:265, 9A  !
5A	that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him	213:265,10A  !
5A	hitherto. No, if he had believed me at all to share his	213:265,11A  !
5A	feelings, he would not have been so wretched. Could he	213:265,12A  !
5A	have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language	213:265,13A  !
5A	at parting would have been different.~ Still, however,	213:265,14A  !
5A	I must be on my guard. This is in the supposition of his	213:265,15A  !
5A	attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know	213:265,16A  !
5A	that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite	213:265,17A  !
5A	the sort of man~ I do not altogether build upon his	213:265,18A  !
5A	steadiness or constancy.~ His feelings are warm, but I can	213:265,19A  !
5A	imagine them rather changeable.~ Every consideration of	213:265,20A  !
5A	the subject, in short, makes me thankful that my happiness	213:265,21A  !
5A	is not more deeply involved.~ I shall do very well again	213:265,22A  !
5A	after a little while~ and then, it will be a good thing over;	213:265,23A  !
5A	for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and	213:265,24A  !
5A	I shall have been let off easily."	213:265,25A  !

5A	strongest reproach you can make \me\. You could not give	213:268, 6A  !
5A	me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It was all	213:268, 7A  !
5A	my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure you.~	213:268, 8A  !
5A	Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you~ and	213:268, 9A  !

5A	the sake of what is more important than my comfort,	213:268,17A  !
5A	a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what	213:268,18A  !

5A	very important~ and sorry I am that you cannot feel them	213:268,23A  !
5A	sufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain	213:268,24A  !

5A	tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so	213:269,10A  !

5I	how very like the staircase was; placed exactly in the	214:273, 2I  !
5I	same part of the house. I really could not help exclaiming|	214:273, 3I  !
5I	I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very delightful	214:273, 4I  !
5I	to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial	214:273, 5I  !
5I	to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months	214:273, 6I  !
5I	there|	214:273, 7I  !
5I	A charming place,	214:273, 7I  !
5I	undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by its	214:273, 8I  !
5I	beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home. Whenever	214:273, 9I  !
5I	you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will	214:273,10I  !
5I	understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing	214:273,11I  !
5I	at all like what one has left behind. I always say this is	214:273,12I  !
5I	quite one of the evils of matrimony."	214:273,13I  !
5I	"So extremely like Maple Grove| And it is not merely	214:273,17I  !
5I	the house~ the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could	214:273,18I  !
5I	observe, are strikingly like. The laurels at Maple Grove	214:273,19I  !
5I	are in the same profusion as here, and stand very much in	214:273,20I  !
5I	the same way~ just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse	214:273,21I  !
5I	of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me	214:273,22I  !
5I	so exactly in mind| My brother and sister will be enchanted	214:273,23I  !
5I	with this place. People who have extensive	214:273,24I  !
5I	grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in	214:273,25I  !
5I	the same style."	214:273,26I  !
5A	"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid	214:273,33A  !
5A	you will think you have over-rated Hartfield. Surry is	214:273,34A  !
5A	full of beauties."	214:273,35A  !
5I	"Oh| yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden	214:273,36I  !
5I	of England, you know. Surry is the garden of England."	214:273,37I  !
5A	"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.	214:273,38A  !
5A	Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of	214:274, 1A  !
5A	England, as well as Surry."	214:274, 2A  !
5I	"No, I fancy not,"	214:274, 3I  !
5I	"I never heard any county but Surry	214:274, 4I  !
5I	called so."	214:274, 5I  !
5I	"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the	214:274, 7I  !
5I	spring, or summer at farthest,"	214:274, 8I  !
5I	"and that will be our time for exploring. While they are	214:274, 9I  !
5I	with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say. They	214:274,10I  !
5I	will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds	214:274,11I  !
5I	four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing	214:274,12I  !
5I	of \our\ carriage, we should be able to explore the different	214:274,13I  !
5I	beauties extremely well. They would hardly come in	214:274,14I  !
5I	their chaise, I think, at that season of the year. Indeed,	214:274,15I  !
5I	when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend	214:274,16I  !
5I	their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very	214:274,17I  !
5I	much preferable. When people come into a beautiful	214:274,18I  !
5I	country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one	214:274,19I  !
5I	naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and	214:274,20I  !
5I	Mr% Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored	214:274,21I  !
5I	to King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most	214:274,22I  !
5I	delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau.	214:274,23I  !
5I	You have many parties of that kind here,	214:274,24I  !
5I	I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?"	214:274,25I  !
5A	"No; not immediately here. We are rather out of	214:274,26A  !
5A	distance of the very striking beauties which attract the	214:274,27A  !
5A	sort of parties you speak of; and we are a very quiet set	214:274,28A  !
5A	of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home than	214:274,29A  !
5A	engage in schemes of pleasure."	214:274,30A  !
5I	"Ah| there is nothing like staying at home, for real	214:274,31I  !
5I	comfort. Nobody can be more devoted to home than	214:274,32I  !
5I	I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove. Many	214:274,33I  !
5I	a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol,	214:274,34I  !
5I	Many a time she has	214:275, 1I  !
5I	said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion.	214:275, 2I  !
5I	I think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up	214:275, 3I  !
5I	entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it	214:275, 4I  !
5I	is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper	214:275, 5I  !
5I	degree, without living in it either too much or too little.	214:275, 6I  !
5I	I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse~	214:275, 7I  !
5I	Your	214:275, 8I  !
5I	father's state of health must be a great drawback. Why	214:275, 9I  !
5I	does not he try Bath?~ Indeed he should. Let me	214:275,10I  !
5I	recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt	214:275,11I  !
5I	of its doing Mr% Woodhouse good."	214:275,12I  !
5A	"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but	214:275,13A  !
5A	without receiving any benefit; and Mr% Perry, whose	214:275,14A  !
5A	name, I dare say, is not unknown to you, does not conceive	214:275,15A  !
5A	it would be at all more likely to be useful now."	214:275,16A  !
5I	"Ah| that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,	214:275,17I  !
5I	where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the	214:275,18I  !
5I	relief they give. In my Bath life, I have seen such	214:275,19I  !
5I	instances of it| And it is so cheerful a place, that it could	214:275,20I  !
5I	not fail of being of use to Mr% Woodhouse's spirits, which,	214:275,21I  !
5I	I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to	214:275,22I  !
5I	its recommendations to \you\, I fancy I need not take much	214:275,23I  !
5I	pains to dwell on them. The advantages of Bath to the	214:275,24I  !
5I	young are pretty generally understood. It would be	214:275,25I  !
5I	a charming introduction for you, who have lived so	214:275,26I  !
5I	secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some	214:275,27I  !
5I	of the best society in the place. A line from me would	214:275,28I  !
5I	bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my particular	214:275,29I  !
5I	friend, Mrs% Partridge, the lady I have always resided with	214:275,30I  !
5I	when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any	214:275,31I  !
5I	attentions, and would be the very person for you to go	214:275,32I  !
5I	into public with."	214:275,33I  !
5A	"but their going to Bath was quite out of the	214:276, 6A  !
5A	question; and she was not perfectly convinced that the	214:276, 7A  !
5A	place might suit her better than her father."	214:276, 8A  !
5A	"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs% Elton.	214:276,11A  !
5A	Upon these occasions, a lady's character generally	214:276,12A  !
5A	precedes her; and Highbury has long known that you	214:276,13A  !
5A	are a superior performer."	214:276,14A  !
5I	"Oh| no, indeed; I must protest against any such	214:276,15I  !
5I	idea. A superior performer|~ very far from it, I assure	214:276,16I  !
5I	you. Consider from how partial a quarter your information	214:276,17I  !
5I	came. I am doatingly fond of music~ passionately	214:276,18I  !
5I	fond;~ and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of	214:276,19I  !
5I	taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my	214:276,20I  !
5I	performance is \mediocre\ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse,	214:276,21I  !
5I	I well know, play delightfully. I assure you	214:276,22I  !
5I	it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight	214:276,23I  !
5I	to me, to hear what a musical society I am got into.	214:276,24I  !
5I	I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary	214:276,25I  !
5I	of life to me; and having always been used to a very	214:276,26I  !
5I	musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would	214:276,27I  !
5I	have been a most serious sacrifice. I honestly said as	214:276,28I  !
5I	much to Mr% E% when he was speaking of my future home,	214:276,29I  !
5I	and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be	214:276,30I  !
5I	disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too~	214:276,31I  !
5I	knowing what I had been accustomed to~ of course he	214:276,32I  !
5I	was not wholly without apprehension. When he was	214:276,33I  !
5I	speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that \the\ \world\	214:276,34I  !
5I	I could give up~ parties, balls, plays~ for I had no fear	214:276,35I  !
5I	of retirement. Blessed with so many resources within	214:276,36I  !
5I	myself, the world was not necessary to \me\. I could do	214:276,37I  !
5I	very well without it. To those who had no resources it	214:276,38I  !
5I	was a different thing; but my resources made me quite	214:277, 1I  !
5I	independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had	214:277, 2I  !
5I	been used to, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped	214:277, 3I  !
5I	I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.	214:277, 4I  !
5I	Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at	214:277, 5I  !
5I	Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages	214:277, 6I  !
5I	were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious	214:277, 7I  !
5I	apartments. ""But,"" said I, ""to be quite honest, I do not	214:277, 8I  !
5I	think I can live without something of a musical society.	214:277, 9I  !
5I	I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would	214:277,10I  !
5I	be a blank for me."""	214:277,11I  !
5A	"We cannot suppose,"	214:277,12A  !
5A	"that	214:277,12A  !
5A	Mr% Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being	214:277,13A  !
5A	a \very\ musical society in Highbury; and I hope you will	214:277,14A  !
5A	not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be	214:277,15A  !
5A	pardoned, in consideration of the motive."	214:277,16A  !
5I	"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.	214:277,17I  !
5I	I am delighted to find myself in such a circle. I hope we	214:277,18I  !
5I	shall have many sweet little concerts together. I think,	214:277,19I  !
5I	Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a musical	214:277,20I  !
5I	club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or	214:277,21I  !
5I	ours. Will not it be a good plan? If \we\ exert ourselves,	214:277,22I  !
5I	I think we shall not be long in want of allies. Something	214:277,23I  !
5I	of that nature would be particularly desirable for \me\, as	214:277,24I  !
5I	an inducement to keep me in practice; for married	214:277,25I  !
5I	women, you know~ there is a sad story against them, in	214:277,26I  !
5I	general. They are but too apt to give up music."	214:277,27I  !
5A	"But you, who are so extremely fond of it~ there can	214:277,28A  !
5A	be no danger, surely."	214:277,29A  !
5I	"I should hope not; but really when I look round	214:277,30I  !
5I	among my acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely	214:277,31I  !
5I	given up music~ never touches the instrument~ though	214:277,32I  !
5I	she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs% Jeffereys~	214:277,33I  !
5I	Clara Partridge, that was~ and of the two	214:277,34I  !
5I	Milmans, now Mrs% Bird and Mrs% James Cooper; and of	214:277,35I  !
5I	more than I can enumerate. Upon my word it is enough	214:277,36I  !
5I	to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with	214:277,37I  !
5I	Selina; but really I begin to comprehend that	214:277,38I  !
5I	a married woman has many things to call her attention.	214:278, 1I  !
5I	I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my	214:278, 2I  !
5I	housekeeper."	214:278, 3I  !
5A	"But every thing of that kind,"	214:278, 4A  !
5A	"will soon	214:278, 4A  !
5A	be in so regular a train~"	214:278, 5A  !
5I	"Well,"	214:278, 6I  !
5I	"we shall see."	214:278, 6I  !
5I	"We have been calling at Randalls,"	214:278,10I  !
5I	"and	214:278,10I  !
5I	found them both at home; and very pleasant people they	214:278,11I  !
5I	seem to be. I like them extremely. Mr% Weston seems an	214:278,12I  !
5I	excellent creature~ quite a first-rate favourite with me	214:278,13I  !
5I	already, I assure you. And \she\ appears so truly good~	214:278,14I  !
5I	there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about	214:278,15I  !
5I	her, that it wins upon one directly. She was your governess,	214:278,16I  !
5I	I think?"	214:278,17I  !
5I	"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished	214:278,21I  !
5I	to find her so very lady-like| But she is really quite the	214:278,22I  !
5I	gentlewoman."	214:278,23I  !
5A	"Mrs% Weston's manners,"	214:278,24A  !
5A	"were always	214:278,24A  !
5A	particularly good. Their propriety, simplicity, and	214:278,25A  !
5A	elegance, would make them the safest model for any young	214:278,26A  !
5A	woman."	214:278,27A  !
5I	"And who do you think came in while we were there?"	214:278,28I  !
5I	"Knightley|"	214:278,31I  !
5I	"Knightley	214:278,31I  !
5I	himself|~ Was not it lucky?~ for, not being within when	214:278,32I  !
5I	he called the other day, I had never seen him before; and	214:278,33I  !
5I	of course, as so particular a friend of Mr% E%'s, I had	214:278,34I  !
5I	a great curiosity.	214:278,35I  !
5I	had been so	214:278,35I  !
5I	often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;	214:278,36I  !
5I	and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he	214:278,37I  !
5I	need not be ashamed of his friend. Knightley is quite the	214:278,38I  !
5I	gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, I think,	214:279, 1I  !
5I	a very gentleman-like man."	214:279, 2I  !
5A	"Insufferable woman|"	214:279, 5A  !
5A	"Worse than I had supposed. Absolutely insufferable|	214:279, 6A  !
5A	Knightley|~ I could not have believed it. Knightley|~	214:279, 7A  !
5A	never seen him in her life before, and call him	214:279, 8A  !
5A	Knightley|~ and discover that he is a gentleman| A little	214:279, 9A  !
5A	upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr% E%, and her \caro sposo\,	214:279,10A  !
5A	and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and	214:279,11A  !
5A	under-bred finery. Actually to discover that Mr% Knightley	214:279,12A  !
5A	is a gentleman| I doubt whether he will return the	214:279,13A  !
5A	compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could	214:279,14A  !
5A	not have believed it| And to propose that she and I should	214:279,15A  !
5A	unite to form a musical club| One would fancy we were	214:279,16A  !
5A	bosom friends| And Mrs% Weston|~ Astonished that the	214:279,17A  !
5A	person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman|	214:279,18A  !
5A	Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much	214:279,19A  !
5A	beyond my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.	214:279,20A  !
5A	Oh| what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were	214:279,21A  !
5A	here? How angry and how diverted he would be| Ah|	214:279,22A  !
5A	there I am~ thinking of him directly. Always the first	214:279,23A  !
5A	person to be thought of| How I catch myself out| Frank Churchill	214:279,24A  !
5A	comes as regularly into my mind|"~	214:279,25A  !
5P	"Well, my dear,"	214:279,30P  !
5P	"considering	214:279,30P  !
5P	we never saw her before, she seems a very pretty sort of	214:279,31P  !
5P	young lady; and I dare say she was very much pleased	214:279,32P  !
5P	with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little quickness	214:279,33P  !
5P	of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe	214:279,34P  !
5P	I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody	214:279,35P  !
5P	speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor. However, she	214:279,36P  !
5P	seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved young lady, and	214:279,37P  !
5P	no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think	214:279,38P  !
5P	he had better not have married. I made the best excuses	214:280, 1P  !
5P	I could for not having been able to wait on him and	214:280, 2P  !
5P	Mrs% Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped	214:280, 3P  !
5P	I \should\ in the course of the summer. But I ought to have	214:280, 4P  !
5P	gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss.	214:280, 5P  !
5P	Ah| it shews what a sad invalid I am| But I do not like	214:280, 6P  !
5P	the corner into Vicarage-lane."	214:280, 7P  !
5A	"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr% Elton	214:280, 8A  !
5A	knows you."	214:280, 9A  !
5P	"Yes: but the young lady~ a bride~ I ought to have	214:280,10P  !
5P	paid my respects to her if possible. It was being very	214:280,11P  !
5P	deficient."	214:280,12P  !
5A	"But my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony;	214:280,13A  !
5A	and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your	214:280,14A  !
5A	respects to a \bride\? It ought to be no recommendation	214:280,15A  !
5A	to \you\. It is encouraging people to marry if you make so	214:280,16A  !
5A	much of them."	214:280,17A  !
5P	"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry,	214:280,18P  !
5P	but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to	214:280,19P  !
5P	a lady~ and a bride, especially, is never to be neglected.	214:280,20P  !
5P	More is avowedly due to \her\. A bride, you know, my dear,	214:280,21P  !
5P	is always the first in company, let the others be who they	214:280,22P  !
5P	may."	214:280,23P  !
5A	"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry,	214:280,24A  !
5A	I do not know what is. And I should never have expected	214:280,25A  !
5A	you to be lending your sanction to such vanity-baits for	214:280,26A  !
5A	poor young ladies."	214:280,27A  !
5P	"My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter	214:280,28P  !
5P	of mere common politeness and good-breeding, and has	214:280,29P  !
5P	nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry."	214:280,30P  !
5A	"very pleasant and very elegantly dressed."	215:281,25A  !
5I	"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.~	215:282,23I  !
5I	I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.~ A sweet,	215:282,24I  !
5I	interesting creature. So mild and ladylike~ and with	215:282,25I  !
5I	such talents|~ I assure you I think she has very extraordinary	215:282,26I  !
5I	talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays	215:282,27I  !
5I	extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly	215:282,28I  !
5I	on that point. Oh| she is absolutely charming|	215:282,29I  !
5I	You will laugh at my warmth~ but upon my word; I talk	215:282,30I  !
5I	of nothing but Jane Fairfax.~ And her situation is so	215:282,31I  !
5I	calculated to affect one|~ Miss Woodhouse, we must	215:282,32I  !
5I	exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her.	215:282,33I  !
5I	We must bring her forward. Such talents as her's must	215:282,34I  !
5I	not be suffered to remain unknown.~ I dare say you have	215:282,35I  !
5I	heard those charming lines of the poet,	215:282,36I  !
5I	We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax."	215:283, 1I  !
5A	"I cannot think there is any danger of it,"	215:283, 3A  !
5A	"and when you are better acquainted with	215:283, 4A  !
5A	Miss Fairfax's situation and understand what her home	215:283, 5A  !
5A	has been, with Col% and Mrs% Campbell, I have no idea	215:283, 6A  !
5A	that you will suppose her talents can be unknown."	215:283, 7A  !
5I	"Oh| but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such	215:283, 8I  !
5I	retirement, such obscurity, so thrown away.~ Whatever	215:283, 9I  !
5I	advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are	215:283,10I  !
5I	so palpably at an end| And I think she feels it. I am sure	215:283,11I  !
5I	she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that	215:283,12I  !
5I	she feels the want of encouragement. I like her the better	215:283,13I  !
5I	for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am	215:283,14I  !
5I	a great advocate for timidity~ and I am sure one does not	215:283,15I  !
5I	often meet with it.~ But in those who are at all inferior,	215:283,16I  !
5I	it is extremely prepossessing. Oh| I assure you, Jane Fairfax	215:283,17I  !
5I	is a very delightful character, and interests me	215:283,18I  !
5I	more than I can express."	215:283,19I  !
5A	"You appear to feel a great deal ~ but I am not aware	215:283,20A  !
5A	how you or any of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any	215:283,21A  !
5A	of those who have known her longer than yourself, can	215:283,22A  !
5A	shew her any other attention than"~	215:283,23A  !
5I	"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done	215:283,24I  !
5I	by those who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid.	215:283,25I  !
5I	If \we\ set the example, many will follow it as far as they	215:283,26I  !
5I	can; though all have not our situations. \We\ have	215:283,27I  !
5I	carriages to fetch and convey her home, and \we\ live in	215:283,28I  !
5I	a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax,	215:283,29I  !
5I	at any time, the least inconvenient.~ I should be extremely	215:283,30I  !
5I	displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as	215:283,31I  !
5I	could make me regret having asked \more\ than Jane Fairfax	215:283,32I  !
5I	to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It	215:283,33I  !
5I	is not likely that I \should\, considering what I have been	215:283,34I  !
5I	used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping,	215:283,35I  !
5I	may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being	215:283,36I  !
5I	too careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my	215:283,37I  !
5I	model more than it ought to be~ for we do not at all	215:283,38I  !
5I	affect to equal my brother, Mr% Suckling, in income.~	215:284, 1I  !
5I	However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.~	215:284, 2I  !
5I	I shall certainly have her very often at my	215:284, 3I  !
5I	house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have	215:284, 4I  !
5I	musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be	215:284, 5I  !
5I	constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. My	215:284, 6I  !
5I	acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt	215:284, 7I  !
5I	of hearing of something to suit her shortly.~ I shall introduce	215:284, 8I  !
5I	her, of course, very particularly to my brother and	215:284, 9I  !
5I	sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her	215:284,10I  !
5I	extremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with	215:284,11I  !
5I	them, her fears will completely wear off, for there really	215:284,12I  !
5I	is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly	215:284,13I  !
5I	conciliating.~ I shall have her very often indeed while	215:284,14I  !
5I	they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find	215:284,15I  !
5I	a seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our	215:284,16I  !
5I	exploring parties."	215:284,17I  !
5I	"dear Miss Woodhouse."	215:284,29I  !
5A	"She is a riddle, quite a riddle|"	215:285,11A  !
5A	"To chuse	215:285,11A  !
5A	to remain here month after month, under privations of	215:285,12A  !
5A	every sort| And now to chuse the mortification of	215:285,13A  !
5A	Mrs% Elton's notice and the penury of her conversation,	215:285,14A  !
5A	rather than return to the superior companions who have	215:285,15A  !
5A	always loved her with such real, generous affection."	215:285,16A  !
5O	"We cannot suppose that she had any great enjoyment	215:285,37O  !
5O	at the Vicarage, my dear Emma~ but it is better than	215:285,38O  !
5O	being always at home. Her aunt is a good creature, but,	215:286, 1O  !
5O	as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We	215:286, 2O  !
5O	must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn	215:286, 3O  !
5O	her taste for what she goes to."	215:286, 4O  !
5B	"You are right, Mrs% Weston,"	215:286, 5B  !
5B	"Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming	215:286, 6B  !
5B	a just opinion of Mrs% Elton. Could she have chosen	215:286, 7B  !
5B	with whom to associate, she would not have chosen her.	215:286, 8B  !
5B	But	215:286, 9B  !
5B	she receives	215:286, 9B  !
5B	attentions from Mrs% Elton, which nobody else pays her."	215:286,10B  !
5A	"Such attentions as Mrs% Elton's, I should have	215:286,14A  !
5A	imagined, would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.	215:286,15A  !
5A	Mrs% Elton's invitations I should have imagined any thing	215:286,16A  !
5A	but inviting."	215:286,17A  !
5O	"I should not wonder,"	215:286,18O  !
5O	"if Miss Fairfax	215:286,18O  !
5O	were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination,	215:286,19O  !
5O	by her aunt's eagerness in accepting Mrs% Elton's	215:286,20O  !
5O	civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very likely have	215:286,21O  !
5O	committed her niece and hurried her into a greater	215:286,22O  !
5O	appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would	215:286,23O  !
5O	have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little	215:286,24O  !
5O	change."	215:286,25O  !
5B	"Another thing must be taken into consideration too~	215:286,28B  !
5B	Mrs% Elton does not talk \to\ Miss Fairfax as she speaks \of\	215:286,29B  !
5B	her. We all know the difference between the pronouns he	215:286,30B  !
5B	or she and thou, the plainest-spoken amongst us; we all	215:286,31B  !
5B	feel the influence of a something beyond common civility	215:286,32B  !
5B	in our personal intercourse with each other~ a something	215:286,33B  !
5B	more early implanted. We cannot give any body the	215:286,34B  !
5B	disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the	215:286,35B  !
5B	hour before. We feel things differently. And besides the	215:286,36B  !
5B	operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure	215:286,37B  !
5B	that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs% Elton by her superiority both	215:286,38B  !
5B	of mind and manner; and that face to face Mrs% Elton	215:287, 1B  !
5B	treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to.	215:287, 2B  !
5B	Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in	215:287, 3B  !
5B	Mrs% Elton's way before~ and no degree of vanity can	215:287, 4B  !
5B	prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness	215:287, 5B  !
5B	in action, if not in consciousness."	215:287, 6B  !
5A	"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,"	215:287, 7A  !
5B	"Yes,"	215:287,10B  !
5B	"any body may know how highly	215:287,10B  !
5B	I think of her."	215:287,11B  !
5A	"And yet,"	215:287,12A  !
5A	"And yet,	215:287,14A  !
5A	perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly	215:287,15A  !
5A	it is. The extent of your admiration may take you by	215:287,16A  !
5A	surprize some day or other."	215:287,17A  !
5B	"Oh| are you there?~ But you are miserably behindhand.	215:287,22B  !
5B	Mr% Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."	215:287,23B  !
5B	"That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax,	215:287,27B  !
5B	I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask	215:287,28B  !
5B	her~ and I am very sure I shall never ask her."	215:287,29B  !
5A	"You are not vain, Mr% Knightley. I will say that	215:287,32A  !
5A	for you."	215:287,33A  !
5B	"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax."	215:287,37B  !
5A	"No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too	215:288, 1A  !
5A	much for match-making, for me to presume to take such	215:288, 2A  !
5A	a liberty with you. What I said just now, meant nothing.	215:288, 3A  !
5A	One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea	215:288, 4A  !
5A	of a serious meaning. Oh| no, upon my word I have not	215:288, 5A  !
5A	the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane	215:288, 6A  !
5A	any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this	215:288, 7A  !
5A	comfortable way, if you were married."	215:288, 8A  !
5B	"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of	215:288,10B  !
5B	my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.~	215:288,11B  !
5B	I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure you."	215:288,12B  !
5B	"Jane Fairfax is a very charming	215:288,13B  !
5B	young woman~ but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She	215:288,14B  !
5B	has a fault. She has not the open temper which a man	215:288,15B  !
5B	would wish for in a wife."	215:288,16B  !
5A	"Well,"	215:288,18A  !
5A	"and you soon silenced Mr% Cole,	215:288,18A  !
5A	I suppose?"	215:288,19A  !
5B	"Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told	215:288,20B  !
5B	him he was mistaken; he asked my pardon and said no	215:288,21B  !
5B	more. Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his	215:288,22B  !
5B	neighbours."	215:288,23B  !
5A	"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs% Elton, who	215:288,24A  !
5A	wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world| I wonder	215:288,25A  !
5A	how she speaks of the Coles~ what she calls them| How	215:288,26A  !
5A	can she find any appellation for them, deep enough in	215:288,27A  !
5A	familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley~ what can	215:288,28A  !
5A	she do for Mr% Cole? And so I am not to be surprized	215:288,29A  !
5A	that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be	215:288,30A  !
5A	with her. Mrs% Weston, your argument weighs most with	215:288,31A  !
5A	me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation	215:288,32A  !
5A	of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the	215:288,33A  !
5A	triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over Mrs% Elton. I have	215:288,34A  !
5A	no faith in Mrs% Elton's acknowledging herself the inferior	215:288,35A  !
5A	in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any	215:288,36A  !
5A	restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.	215:288,37A  !
5A	I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting	215:288,38A  !
5A	her visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of	215:289, 1A  !
5A	service; that she will not be continually detailing her	215:289, 2A  !
5A	magnificent intentions, from the procuring her a permanent	215:289, 3A  !
5A	situation to the including her in those delightful	215:289, 4A  !
5A	exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau."	215:289, 5A  !
5B	"Jane Fairfax has feeling,"	215:289, 7B  !
5B	"I do	215:289, 7B  !
5B	not accuse her of want of feeling. Her sensibilities,	215:289, 8B  !
5B	I suspect, are strong~ and her temper excellent in its	215:289, 9B  !
5B	power of forbearance, patience, self-controul; but it	215:289,10B  !
5B	wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think,	215:289,11B  !
5B	than she used to be~ And I love an open temper. No~	215:289,12B  !
5B	till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, it had never	215:289,13B  !
5B	entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with	215:289,14B  !
5B	her, with admiration and pleasure always~ but with no	215:289,15B  !
5B	thought beyond."	215:289,16B  !
5A	"Well, Mrs% Weston,"	215:289,17A  !
5A	"what do you say now to Mr% Knightley's	215:289,18A  !
5A	marrying Jane Fairfax?"	215:289,19A  !
5O	"Why really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much	215:289,20O  !
5O	occupied by the idea of \not\ being in love with her, that	215:289,21O  !
5O	I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last.	215:289,22O  !
5O	Do not beat me."	215:289,23O  !
5I	"I see how it is,"	216:290, 7I  !
5I	"I see what a life I am to	216:290, 7I  !
5I	lead among you. Upon my word we shall be absolutely	216:290, 8I  !
5I	dissipated. We really seem quite the fashion. If this is	216:290, 9I  !
5I	living in the country, it is nothing very formidable. From	216:290,10I  !
5I	Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not	216:290,11I  !
5I	a disengaged day|~ A woman with fewer resources than	216:290,12I  !
5I	I have, need not have been at a loss."	216:290,13I  !
5M	"She would rather not be in \his\	216:291,15M  !
5M	company more than she could help. She was not yet quite	216:291,16M  !
5M	able to see him and his charming happy wife together,	216:291,17M  !
5M	without feeling uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would	216:291,18M  !
5M	not be displeased, she would rather stay at home."	216:291,19M  !
5A	"This is very true,"	216:291,31A  !
5A	"at least as far as relates	216:291,31A  !
5A	to me, which was all that was meant~ and it is very	216:291,32A  !
5A	shameful.~ Of the same age~ and always knowing her~	216:291,33A  !
5A	I ought to have been more her friend.~ She will never like	216:291,34A  !
5A	me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew	216:291,35A  !
5A	her greater attention than I have done."	216:291,36A  !
5P	"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being	216:294,27P  !
5P	out this morning in the rain. Young ladies should take	216:294,28P  !
5P	care of themselves.~ Young ladies are delicate plants.	216:294,29P  !
5P	They should take care of their health and their complexion.	216:294,30P  !
5P	My dear, did you change your stockings?"	216:294,31P  !
5P	"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be	216:294,34P  !
5P	cared for.~ I hope your good grandmamma and aunt are	216:294,35P  !
5P	well. They are some of my very old friends. I wish my	216:294,36P  !
5P	health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You do us	216:294,37P  !
5P	a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter	216:294,38P  !
5P	and I are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have	216:295, 1P  !
5P	the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield."	216:295, 2P  !
5I	"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?~ going to the	216:295, 8I  !
5I	post-office in the rain|~ This must not be, I assure you.~	216:295, 9I  !
5I	You sad girl, how could you do such a thing?~ It is a sign	216:295,10I  !
5I	I was not there to take care of you."	216:295,11I  !
5I	"Oh| do not tell \me\. You really are a very sad girl,	216:295,14I  !
5I	and do not know how to take care of yourself.~ To the	216:295,15I  !
5I	post-office indeed| Mrs% Weston, did you ever hear the	216:295,16I  !
5I	like? You and I must positively exert our authority."	216:295,17I  !
5O	"My advice,"	216:295,18O  !
5O	"I certainly do feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you	216:295,19O  !
5O	must not run such risks.~ Liable as you have been to	216:295,20O  !
5O	severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly careful,	216:295,21O  !
5O	especially at this time of year. The spring I always think	216:295,22O  !
5O	requires more than common care. Better wait an hour	216:295,23O  !
5O	or two, or even half a day for your letters, than run the	216:295,24O  !
5O	risk of bringing on your cough again. Now do not you	216:295,25O  !
5O	feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too	216:295,26O  !
5O	reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing	216:295,27O  !
5O	again."	216:295,28O  !

5I	a thing again:"~	216:295,31I  !
5I	"there must	216:295,31I  !
5I	be some arrangement made, there must indeed. I shall	216:295,32I  !
5I	speak to Mr% E%. The man who fetches our letters every	216:295,33I  !
5I	morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire	216:295,34I  !
5I	for your's too and bring them to you. That will obviate	216:295,35I  !
5I	all difficulties you know; and from \us\ I really think, my	216:295,36I  !
5I	dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept such an	216:295,37I  !
5I	accommodation."	216:295,38I  !
5I	"My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is	216:296, 6I  !
5I	determined, that is	216:296, 7I  !
5I	as far as I can	216:296, 7I  !
5I	presume to determine any thing without the concurrence	216:296, 8I  !
5I	of my lord and master. You know, Mrs% Weston, you and	216:296, 9I  !
5I	I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do	216:296,10I  !
5I	flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not	216:296,11I  !
5I	entirely worn out. If I meet with no insuperable difficulties	216:296,12I  !
5I	therefore, consider that point as settled."	216:296,13I  !
5I	"Oh| my dear; but so much as Patty has to do|~	216:296,19I  !
5I	And it is a kindness to employ our men."	216:296,20I  !
5B	"Yes,"	216:297,15B  !
5B	"there is a likeness.	216:297,15B  !
5B	I know what you mean~ but Emma's hand is the	216:297,16B  !
5B	strongest."	216:297,17B  !
5P	"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,"	216:297,18P  !
5P	"and always did. And so does poor	216:297,19P  !
5P	Mrs% Weston"~	216:297,20P  !
5A	"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting"~	216:297,21A  !
5A	"Mr% Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentlemen's	216:297,33A  !
5A	hands I ever saw."	216:297,34A  !
5B	"I do not admire it,"	216:297,35B  !
5B	"It is too	216:297,35B  !
5B	small~ wants strength. It is like a woman's writing."	216:297,36B  !
5A	"If we were in the other room,"	216:298, 6A  !
5A	"if I had	216:298, 6A  !
5A	my writing-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen.	216:298, 7A  !
5A	I have a note of his.~ Do not you remember, Mrs% Weston,	216:298, 8A  !
5A	employing him to write for you one day?"	216:298, 9A  !
5O	"He chose to say he was employed"~	216:298,10O  !
5A	"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after	216:298,11A  !
5A	dinner to convince Mr% Knightley."	216:298,12A  !
5B	"Oh| when a gallant young man, like Mr% Frank Churchill,"	216:298,13B  !
5B	"writes to a fair	216:298,14B  !
5B	lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of course, put forth his	216:298,15B  !
5B	best."	216:298,16B  !
5I	"Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always	216:298,21I  !
5I	leading the way."	216:298,22I  !
5I	"Here is April come|"	217:299,17I  !
5I	"I get quite anxious	217:299,17I  !
5I	about you. June will soon be here."	217:299,18I  !
5I	"But have you really heard of nothing?"	217:299,21I  !
5I	"Oh| my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are	217:299,24I  !
5I	not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the	217:299,25I  !
5I	desirable thing."	217:299,26I  !
5I	"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have.	217:299,29I  !
5I	You do not know how many candidates there always are	217:299,30I  !
5I	for the \first\ situations. I saw a vast deal of that in the	217:299,31I  !
5I	neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of Mr% Suckling,	217:299,32I  !
5I	Mrs% Bragge, had such an infinity of applications;	217:299,33I  !
5I	every body was anxious to be in her family, for she moves	217:299,34I  !
5I	in the first circle. Wax-candles in the school-room| You	217:300, 1I  !
5I	may imagine how desirable| Of all the houses in the kingdom	217:300, 2I  !
5I	Mrs% Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you in."	217:300, 3I  !
5I	"Trouble| aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid	217:300, 9I  !
5I	of giving me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane,	217:300,10I  !
5I	the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you	217:300,11I  !
5I	than I am. I shall write to Mrs% Partridge in a day or two,	217:300,12I  !
5I	and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out for	217:300,13I  !
5I	any thing eligible."	217:300,14I  !
5I	"But, my dear child, the time \is\ drawing near; here	217:300,18I  !
5I	is April, and June, or say even July, is very near, with	217:300,19I  !
5I	such business to accomplish before us. Your inexperience	217:300,20I  !
5I	really amuses me| A situation such as you deserve, and	217:300,21I  !
5I	your friends would require for you, is no every day	217:300,22I  !
5I	occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed,	217:300,23I  !
5I	indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."	217:300,24I  !
5I	"Oh| my dear, human flesh| You quite shock me; if	217:300,32I  !
5I	you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr% Suckling	217:300,33I  !
5I	was always rather a friend to the abolition."	217:300,34I  !
5I	"Something that would do|"	217:301, 5I  !
5I	"Aye, \that\ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;~	217:301, 6I  !
5I	I know what a modest creature you are; but it will not	217:301, 7I  !
5I	satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing	217:301, 8I  !
5I	that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in	217:301, 9I  !
5I	a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command	217:301,10I  !
5I	the elegancies of life."	217:301,11I  !
5I	"I know you, I know you; you would take up with	217:301,17I  !
5I	any thing; but I shall be a little more nice, and I am sure	217:301,18I  !
5I	the good Campbells will be quite on my side; with your	217:301,19I  !
5I	superior talents, you have a right to move in the first circle.	217:301,20I  !
5I	Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name	217:301,21I  !
5I	your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and	217:301,22I  !
5I	mix in the family as much as you chose;~ that is~ I do	217:301,23I  !
5I	not know~ if you knew the harp, you might do all that,	217:301,24I  !
5I	I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;~ yes,	217:301,25I  !
5I	I really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate	217:301,26I  !
5I	for what you chose;~ and you must and shall be delightfully,	217:301,27I  !
5I	honourably and comfortably settled before the	217:301,28I  !
5I	Campbells or I have any rest."	217:301,29I  !
5I	"And I am quite serious too, I assure you,"	217:302, 1I  !
5I	"in resolving to be always on the watch,	217:302, 2I  !
5I	and employing my friends to watch also, that nothing	217:302, 3I  !
5I	really unexceptionable may pass us."	217:302, 4I  !
5I	"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest|~	217:302, 9I  !
5I	Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the	217:302,10I  !
5I	other men|~ what a dear creature he is;~ I assure you	217:302,11I  !
5I	I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint, old-fashioned	217:302,12I  !
5I	politeness; it is much more to my taste than	217:302,13I  !
5I	modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. But this	217:302,14I  !
5I	good old Mr% Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant	217:302,15I  !
5I	speeches to me at dinner. Oh| I assure you I began to	217:302,16I  !
5I	think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy	217:302,17I  !
5I	I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How	217:302,18I  !
5I	do you like it?~ Selina's choice~ handsome, I think, but	217:302,19I  !
5I	I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the	217:302,20I  !
5I	greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed~ quite	217:302,21I  !
5I	a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments \now\	217:302,22I  !
5I	because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must	217:302,23I  !
5I	appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity;	217:302,24I  !
5I	a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery.	217:302,25I  !
5I	But I am quite in the minority, I believe; few people seem	217:302,26I  !
5I	to value simplicity of dress,~ shew and finery are every thing.	217:302,27I  !
5I	I have some notion of putting such a trimming as	217:302,28I  !
5I	this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will	217:302,29I  !
5I	look well?"	217:302,30I  !
5N	"Read it, read it,"	217:303,33N  !
5N	"it will give you pleasure;	217:303,33N  !
5N	only a few lines~ will not take you long; read it to Emma."	217:303,34N  !
5N	"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.	217:303,38N  !
5N	Well, what do you say to it?~ I always told you he would	217:304, 1N  !
5N	be here again soon, did not I?~ Anne, my dear, did not	217:304, 2N  !
5N	I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?~ In	217:304, 3N  !
5N	town next week, you see ~ at the latest, I dare say; for	217:304, 4N  !
5N	\she\ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing	217:304, 5N  !
5N	is to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or	217:304, 6N  !
5N	Saturday. As to her illness, all nothing of course. But it	217:304, 7N  !
5N	is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so	217:304, 8N  !
5N	near as town. They will stay a good while when they do	217:304, 9N  !
5N	come, and he will be half his time with us. This is precisely	217:304,10N  !
5N	what I wanted. Well, pretty good news, is not it?	217:304,11N  !
5N	Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all? Put it up,	217:304,12N  !
5N	put it up; we will have a good talk about it some other	217:304,13N  !
5N	time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the	217:304,14N  !
5N	circumstance to the others in a common way."	217:304,15N  !
5N	"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing	218:305, 1N  !
5N	my son to you,"	218:305, 2N  !
5N	"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,"	218:305, 5N  !
5N	"and know him to be my son,	218:305, 6N  !
5N	though he does not bear my name."	218:305, 7N  !
5I	"Oh| yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance.	218:305, 8I  !
5I	I am sure Mr% Elton will lose no time in calling on him;	218:305, 9I  !
5I	and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the	218:305,10I  !
5I	Vicarage."	218:305,11I  !
5N	"You are very obliging.~ Frank will be extremely	218:305,12N  !
5N	happy, I am sure.~ He is to be in town next week, if not	218:305,13N  !
5N	sooner. We have notice of it in a letter to-day. I met the	218:305,14N  !
5N	letters in my way this morning, and seeing my son's hand,	218:305,15N  !
5N	presumed to open it~ though it was not directed to me~	218:305,16N  !
5N	it was to Mrs% Weston. She is his principal correspondent,	218:305,17N  !
5N	I assure you. I hardly ever get a letter."	218:305,18N  !
5I	"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to	218:305,19I  !
5I	her| oh| Mr% Weston~	218:305,20I  !
5I	I must	218:305,20I  !
5I	protest against that.~ A most dangerous precedent	218:305,21I  !
5I	indeed|~ I beg you will not let your neighbours follow	218:305,22I  !
5I	your example.~ Upon my word, if this is what I am to	218:305,23I  !
5I	expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves|	218:305,24I  !
5I	~Oh| Mr% Weston, I could not have believed it of you|"	218:305,25I  !
5N	"Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of	218:305,26N  !
5N	yourself, Mrs% Elton.~ This letter tells us~ it is a short	218:305,27N  !
5N	letter~ written in a hurry, merely to give us notice~ it	218:305,28N  !
5N	tells us that they are all coming up to town directly, on	218:305,29N  !
5N	Mrs% Churchill's account~ she has not been well the whole	218:305,30N  !
5N	winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her~ so they are	218:305,31N  !
5N	all to move southward without loss of time."	218:305,32N  !
5I	"Indeed|~ from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in	218:305,33I  !
5I	Yorkshire?"	218:305,34I  !
5N	"Yes, they are about 190 miles from London. A considerable	218:306, 1N  !
5N	journey."	218:306, 2N  !
5I	"Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five	218:306, 3I  !
5I	miles farther than from Maple Grove to London. But	218:306, 4I  !
5I	what is distance, Mr% Weston, to people of large fortune?~	218:306, 5I  !
5I	You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr% Suckling,	218:306, 6I  !
5I	sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me~	218:306, 7I  !
5I	but twice in one week he and Mr% Bragge went to London	218:306, 8I  !
5I	and back again with four horses."	218:306, 9I  !
5N	"The evil of the distance from Enscombe,"	218:306,10N  !
5N	"is, that Mrs% Churchill, \as\ \we\ \understand\,	218:306,11N  !
5N	has not been able to leave the sopha for a week together.	218:306,12N  !
5N	In Frank's last letter she complained, he said, of being too	218:306,13N  !
5N	weak to get into her conservatory without having both his	218:306,14N  !
5N	arm and his uncle's| This, you know, speaks a great	218:306,15N  !
5N	degree of weakness~ but now she is so impatient to be in	218:306,16N  !
5N	town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.	218:306,17N  !
5N	~ So Frank writes word. Certainly, delicate ladies have	218:306,18N  !
5N	very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs% Elton. You must	218:306,19N  !
5N	grant me that."	218:306,20N  !
5I	"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take	218:306,21I  !
5I	the part of my own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice~	218:306,22I  !
5I	You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point.	218:306,23I  !
5I	I always stand up for women~ and I assure you, if you	218:306,24I  !
5I	knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn,	218:306,25I  !
5I	you would not wonder at Mrs% Churchill's making incredible	218:306,26I  !
5I	exertions to avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her~	218:306,27I  !
5I	and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety. She	218:306,28I  !
5I	always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution.	218:306,29I  !
5I	Does Mrs% Churchill do the same?"	218:306,30I  !
5N	"Depend upon it, Mrs% Churchill does everything that	218:306,31N  !
5N	any other fine lady ever did. Mrs% Churchill will not be	218:306,32N  !
5N	second to any lady in the land for"~	218:306,33N  !
5I	"Oh| Mr% Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine	218:306,35I  !
5I	lady, I assure you. Do not run away with such an idea."	218:306,36I  !
5N	"Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs% Churchill,	218:306,37N  !
5N	who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."	218:306,38N  !
5N	"Mrs% Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you	218:307, 7N  !
5N	may suspect~ but this is quite between ourselves. She	218:307, 8N  !
5N	is very fond of Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill	218:307, 9N  !
5N	of her. Besides, she is out of health now; but \that\ indeed,	218:307,10N  !
5N	by her own account, she has always been. I would not	218:307,11N  !
5N	say so to every body, Mrs% Elton, but I have not much	218:307,12N  !
5N	faith in Mrs% Churchill's illness."	218:307,13N  !
5I	"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr% Weston?~	218:307,14I  !
5I	To Bath, or to Clifton?"	218:307,15I  !
5N	"She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too	218:307,16N  !
5N	cold for her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of	218:307,17N  !
5N	Enscombe. She has now been a longer time stationary	218:307,18N  !
5N	there, than she ever was before, and she begins to want	218:307,19N  !
5N	change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very	218:307,20N  !
5N	retired."	218:307,21N  !
5I	"Aye~ like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can	218:307,22I  !
5I	stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove.	218:307,23I  !
5I	Such an immense plantation all round it| You seem shut	218:307,24I  !
5I	out from every thing~ in the most complete retirement.~	218:307,25I  !
5I	And Mrs% Churchill probably has not health or spirits like	218:307,26I  !
5I	Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she	218:307,27I  !
5I	may not have resources in herself to be qualified	218:307,28I  !
5I	for a country life. I always say a woman cannot have too	218:307,29I  !
5I	many resources~ and I feel very thankful that I have so	218:307,30I  !
5I	many myself as to be quite independent of society."	218:307,31I  !
5N	"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."	218:307,32N  !
5I	"So I remember to have heard. He will find an	218:307,33I  !
5I	\addition\ to the society of Highbury when he comes again;	218:307,34I  !
5I	that is, if I may presume to call myself an addition. But	218:307,35I  !
5I	perhaps he may never have heard of there being such	218:307,36I  !
5I	a creature in the world."	218:307,37I  !
5N	"My dear madam| Nobody but yourself could imagine	218:308, 3N  !
5N	such a thing possible. Not heard of you|~ I believe	218:308, 4N  !
5N	Mrs% Weston's letters lately have been full of very little else	218:308, 5N  !
5N	than Mrs% Elton."	218:308, 6N  !
5N	"When Frank left us,"	218:308, 8N  !
5N	"it was quite	218:308, 8N  !
5N	uncertain when we might see him again, which makes	218:308, 9N  !
5N	this day's news doubly welcome. It has been completely	218:308,10N  !
5N	unexpected. That is, \I\ always had a strong persuasion he	218:308,11N  !
5N	would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable	218:308,12N  !
5N	would turn up~ but nobody believed me. He and	218:308,13N  !
5N	Mrs% Weston were both dreadfully desponding.	218:308,14N  !
5N	and so	218:308,16N  !
5N	forth~ I always felt that something would happen in our	218:308,17N  !
5N	favour; and so it has, you see. I have observed, Mrs% Elton,	218:308,18N  !
5N	in the course of my life, that if things are going	218:308,19N  !
5N	untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next."	218:308,20N  !
5I	"Very true, Mr% Weston, perfectly true. It is just what	218:308,21I  !
5I	I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the	218:308,22I  !
5I	days of courtship, when, because things did not go quite	218:308,23I  !
5I	right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited	218:308,24I  !
5I	his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that	218:308,25I  !
5I	he was sure at this rate it would be \May\ before Hymen's	218:308,26I  !
5I	saffron robe would be put on for us| Oh| the pains I have	218:308,27I  !
5I	been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller	218:308,28I  !
5I	views| The carriage~ we had disappointments	218:308,29I  !
5I	about the carriage;~ one morning, I remember, he came	218:308,30I  !
5I	to me quite in despair."	218:308,31I  !
5N	"You were mentioning May. May is the very month	218:308,34N  !
5N	which Mrs% Churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to	218:308,35N  !
5N	spend in some warmer place than Enscombe~ in short, to	218:308,36N  !
5N	spend in London; so that we have the agreeable prospect	218:308,37N  !
5N	of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring~ precisely	218:308,38N  !
5N	the season of the year which one should have chosen for it:	218:309, 1N  !
5N	days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant,	218:309, 2N  !
5N	always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.	218:309, 3N  !
5N	When he was here before, we made the best of it; but	218:309, 4N  !
5N	there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather;	218:309, 5N  !
5N	there always is in February, you know, and we could not	218:309, 6N  !
5N	do half that we intended. Now will be the time. This	218:309, 7N  !
5N	will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs% Elton,	218:309, 8N  !
5N	whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort	218:309, 9N  !
5N	of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day	218:309,10N  !
5N	or to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more	218:309,11N  !
5N	friendly to happiness than having him actually in the	218:309,12N  !
5N	house. I think it is so. I think it is the state of mind	218:309,13N  !
5N	which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be	218:309,14N  !
5N	pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.	218:309,15N  !
5N	He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not	218:309,16N  !
5N	expect a prodigy. Mrs% Weston's partiality for him is very	218:309,17N  !
5N	great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying to me.	218:309,18N  !
5N	She thinks nobody equal to him."	218:309,19N  !
5I	"And I assure you, Mr% Weston, I have very little	218:309,20I  !
5I	doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour.	218:309,21I  !
5I	I have heard so much in praise of Mr% Frank Churchill.~	218:309,22I  !
5I	At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one of	218:309,23I  !
5I	those who always judge for themselves, and are by no	218:309,24I  !
5I	means implicitly guided by others. I give you notice that	218:309,25I  !
5I	as I find your son, so I shall judge him.~ I am no	218:309,26I  !
5I	flatterer."	218:309,27I  !
5N	"I hope,"	218:309,29N  !
5N	"I have not been severe	218:309,29N  !
5N	upon poor Mrs% Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to	218:309,30N  !
5N	do her injustice; but there are some traits in her character	218:309,31N  !
5N	which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the	218:309,32N  !
5N	forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant,	218:309,33N  !
5N	Mrs% Elton, of my connection with the family, nor of the	218:309,34N  !
5N	treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the	218:309,35N  !
5N	whole blame of it is to be laid on her. She was the instigator.	218:309,36N  !
5N	Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was	218:309,37N  !
5N	but for her. Mr% Churchill has pride; but his pride is	218:309,38N  !
5N	nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentleman-like	218:310, 1N  !
5N	sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only make	218:310, 2N  !
5N	himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is	218:310, 3N  !
5N	arrogance and insolence| And what inclines one less to	218:310, 4N  !
5N	bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood. She was	218:310, 5N  !
5N	nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of	218:310, 6N  !
5N	a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into	218:310, 7N  !
5N	a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them all in high and	218:310, 8N  !
5N	mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is an	218:310, 9N  !
5N	upstart."	218:310,10N  !
5I	"Only think| well, that must be infinitely provoking|	218:310,11I  !
5I	I have quite a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given	218:310,12I  !
5I	me a thorough disgust of people of that sort; for there is	218:310,13I  !
5I	a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance	218:310,14I  !
5I	to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves|	218:310,15I  !
5I	Your description of Mrs% Churchill made me think	218:310,16I  !
5I	of them directly. People of the name of Tupman, very	218:310,17I  !
5I	lately settled there, and encumbered with many low	218:310,18I  !
5I	connections, but giving themselves immense airs, and	218:310,19I  !
5I	expecting to be on a footing with the old established	218:310,20I  !
5I	families. A year and a half is the very utmost that they	218:310,21I  !
5I	can have lived at West Hall; and how they got their	218:310,22I  !
5I	fortune nobody knows. They came from Birmingham,	218:310,23I  !
5I	which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr% Weston.	218:310,24I  !
5I	One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always	218:310,25I  !
5I	say there is something direful in the sound: but nothing	218:310,26I  !
5I	more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good	218:310,27I  !
5I	many things I assure you are suspected; and yet by their	218:310,28I  !
5I	manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my	218:310,29I  !
5I	brother, Mr% Suckling, who happens to be one of their	218:310,30I  !
5I	nearest neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr% Suckling	218:310,31I  !
5I	who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and	218:310,32I  !
5I	whose father had it before him~ I believe, at least~ I am	218:310,33I  !
5I	almost sure that old Mr% Suckling had completed the	218:310,34I  !
5I	purchase before his death."	218:310,35I  !
5A	"I rather hope to satisfy you both,"	218:311,19A  !
5A	"for	218:311,19A  !
5A	I shall do all in my power to make them happy, which	218:311,20A  !
5A	will be enough for Isabella; and happiness must preclude	218:311,21A  !
5A	false indulgence and physic."	218:311,22A  !
5A	"That is very likely. You think so, do not you?"	218:311,25A  !
5A	"Increase|"	218:311,30A  !
5A	"Difference| No indeed I am not."	218:311,33A  !
5B	"Yes,"	218:312, 6B  !
5B	"it is Randalls that	218:312, 6B  !
5B	does it all."	218:312, 7B  !
5B	"No,"	218:312,13B  !
5B	"that need not be the	218:312,13B  !
5B	consequence. Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall	218:312,14B  !
5B	certainly be at leisure."	218:312,15B  !
5A	"Upon my word,"	218:312,16A  !
5A	"you amuse me|	218:312,16A  !
5A	I should like to know how many of all my numerous	218:312,17A  !
5A	engagements take place without your being of the party;	218:312,18A  !
5A	and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure	218:312,19A  !
5A	to attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements	218:312,20A  !
5A	of mine~ what have they been? Dining once with the	218:312,21A  !
5A	Coles~ and having a ball talked of, which never took	218:312,22A  !
5A	place. I can understand you~	218:312,23A  !
5A	your good fortune in meeting with so many	218:312,24A  !
5A	of your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass	218:312,25A  !
5A	unnoticed. But you,	218:312,26A  !
5A	who	218:312,26A  !
5A	know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from	218:312,27A  !
5A	Hartfield, why should you foresee such a series of dissipation	218:312,28A  !
5A	for me, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little	218:312,29A  !
5A	boys, I must say, that if aunt Emma has not time for	218:312,30A  !
5A	them, I do not think they would fare much better with	218:312,31A  !
5A	uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five	218:312,32A  !
5A	hours where she is absent one~ and who, when he is at	218:312,33A  !
5A	home, is either reading to himself or settling his accounts."	218:312,34A  !
5E	"He had seen a group of old	301:316,20E  !
5E	acquaintance in the street as he passed~ he had not	301:316,21E  !
5E	stopped, he would not stop for more than a word~ but he	301:316,22E  !
5E	had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he	301:316,23E  !
5E	did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer at	301:316,24E  !
5E	Hartfield, he must hurry off."	301:316,25E  !
5E	"I think she must be here	302:320,24E  !
5E	soon,"	302:320,25E  !
5E	"I have a great curiosity to see Mrs% Elton,	302:320,25E  !
5E	I have heard so much of her. It cannot be long, I think,	302:320,26E  !
5E	before she comes."	302:320,27E  !
5E	"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.	302:320,30E  !
5E	I have never seen either Mr% or Mrs% Elton. I have no	302:320,31E  !
5E	business to put myself forward."	302:320,32E  !
5N	"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax|"	302:320,35N  !
5N	"We thought you were to bring them."	302:320,36N  !
5E	"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,"	302:321, 7E  !
5E	"Miss Bates must not be	302:321, 8E  !
5E	forgotten:"	302:321, 9E  !
5I	"A very fine young man indeed, Mr% Weston. You	302:321,14I  !
5I	know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion;	302:321,15I  !
5I	and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with	302:321,16I  !
5I	him.~ You may believe me. I never compliment. I think	302:321,17I  !
5I	him a very handsome young man, and his manners are	302:321,18I  !
5I	precisely what I like and approve~ so truly the gentleman,	302:321,19I  !
5I	without the least conceit or puppyism. You must know	302:321,20I  !
5I	I have a vast dislike to puppies~ quite a horror of them.	302:321,21I  !
5I	They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither	302:321,22I  !
5I	Mr% Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them;	302:321,23I  !
5I	and we used sometimes to say very cutting things|	302:321,24I  !
5I	Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them	302:321,25I  !
5I	much better."	302:321,26I  !
5I	"I have no doubt	302:321,31I  !
5I	of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our	302:321,32I  !
5I	coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious|~	302:321,33I  !
5I	I believe we drive faster than anybody.~ What a pleasure	302:321,34I  !
5I	it is to send one's carriage for a friend|~ I understand	302:321,35I  !
5I	you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be	302:321,36I  !
5I	quite unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always	302:321,37I  !
5I	take care of \them\."	302:321,38I  !
5D	"So very obliging of you|~ No rain at all. Nothing to	302:322,11D  !
5D	signify. I do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes.	302:322,12D  !
5D	And Jane declares~ Well|~	302:322,13D  !
5D	Well| This is brilliant indeed|~ This is admirable|	302:322,14D  !
5D	~ Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting.	302:322,15D  !
5D	Could not have imagined it.~ So well lighted up.~	302:322,16D  !
5D	Jane, Jane, look~ did you ever see any thing? Oh|	302:322,17D  !
5D	Mr% Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's lamp.	302:322,18D  !
5D	Good Mrs% Stokes would not know her own room again.	302:322,19D  !
5D	I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance.	302:322,20D  !
5D	""Oh| Mrs% Stokes,"" said I~ but I had not time for	302:322,21D  !
5D	more."	302:322,22D  !
5D	"Very well,	302:322,22D  !
5D	I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very	302:322,23D  !
5D	happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headach|~	302:322,24D  !
5D	seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much	302:322,25D  !
5D	trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah|	302:322,26D  !
5D	dear Mrs% Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage|~ excellent	302:322,27D  !
5D	time.~ Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses	302:322,28D  !
5D	a moment. Most comfortable carriage.~ Oh| and I am	302:322,29D  !
5D	sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs% Weston, on that score.	302:322,30D  !
5D	Mrs% Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should	302:322,31D  !
5D	have been.~ But two such offers in one day|~ Never were	302:322,32D  !
5D	such neighbours. I said to my mother, ""Upon my word,	302:322,33D  !
5D	ma'am~."" Thank you, my mother is remarkably well.	302:322,34D  !
5D	Gone to Mr% Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl~	302:322,35D  !
5D	for the evenings are not warm~ her large new shawl~ Mrs% Dixon's	302:322,36D  !
5D	wedding present.~ So kind of her to think of my	302:322,37D  !
5D	mother| Bought at Weymouth, you know~ Mr% Dixon's	302:322,38D  !
5D	choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they	302:323, 1D  !
5D	hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather	302:323, 2D  !
5D	preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did not	302:323, 3D  !
5D	wet your feet?~ It was but a drop or two, but I am so	302:323, 4D  !
5D	afraid:~ but Mr% Frank Churchill was so extremely~ and	302:323, 5D  !
5D	there was a mat to step upon~ I shall never forget his	302:323, 6D  !
5D	extreme politeness.~ Oh| Mr% Frank Churchill, I must tell	302:323, 7D  !
5D	you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since;	302:323, 8D  !
5D	the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of	302:323, 9D  !
5D	your goodnature. Does not she, Jane?~ Do not we often	302:323,10D  !
5D	talk of Mr% Frank Churchill?~ Ah| here's Miss Woodhouse.~	302:323,11D  !
5D	Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?~ Very	302:323,12D  !
5D	well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in	302:323,13D  !
5D	fairy-land|~ Such a transformation|~ Must not compliment,	302:323,14D  !
5D	I know~	302:323,15D  !
5D	~ that	302:323,15D  !
5D	would be rude~ but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you	302:323,16D  !
5D	do look~ how do you like Jane's hair?~ You are a judge.~	302:323,17D  !
5D	She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her	302:323,18D  !
5D	hair|~ No hairdresser from London I think could.~ Ah|	302:323,19D  !
5D	Dr% Hughes I declare~ and Mrs% Hughes. Must go and	302:323,20D  !
5D	speak to Dr% and Mrs% Hughes for a moment.~ How do	302:323,21D  !
5D	you do? How do you do?~ Very well, I thank you. This	302:323,22D  !
5D	is delightful, is not it?~ Where's dear Mr% Richard?~ Oh|	302:323,23D  !
5D	there he is. Don't disturb him. Much better employed	302:323,24D  !
5D	talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr% Richard?	302:323,25D  !
5D	~ I saw you the other day as you rode through the town	302:323,26D  !
5D	~ Mrs% Otway, I protest|~ and good Mr% Otway, and	302:323,27D  !
5D	Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.~ Such a host of friends|~	302:323,28D  !
5D	and Mr% George and Mr% Arthur|~ How do you do? How	302:323,29D  !
5D	do you all do?~ Quite well, I am much obliged to you.	302:323,30D  !
5D	Never better.~ Don't I hear another carriage?~ Who can	302:323,31D  !
5D	this be?~ very likely the worthy Coles.~ Upon my word,	302:323,32D  !
5D	this is charming to be standing about among such friends|	302:323,33D  !
5D	And such a noble fire|~ I am quite roasted. No coffee,	302:323,34D  !
5D	I thank you, for me~ never take coffee.~ A little tea if	302:323,35D  !
5D	you please, sir, by and bye,~ no hurry~ Oh| here it comes.	302:323,36D  !
5D	Everything so good|"	302:323,37D  !
5I	"How do you like my	302:324, 8I  !
5I	gown?~ How do you like my trimming?~ How has	302:324, 9I  !
5I	Wright done my hair?"~	302:324,10I  !
5I	"Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do~	302:324,13I  !
5I	but upon such an occasion as this, when everybody's eyes	302:324,14I  !
5I	are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons~	302:324,15I  !
5I	who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me	302:324,16I  !
5I	honour~ I would not wish to be inferior to others. And	302:324,17I  !
5I	I see very few pearls in the room except mine.~ So Frank Churchill	302:324,18I  !
5I	is a capital dancer, I understand. We shall see	302:324,19I  !
5I	if our styles suit.~ A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.	302:324,20I  !
5I	I like him very well."	302:324,21I  !
5I	"Oh| you have found us out at last, have you, in our	302:324,29I  !
5I	seclusion?~ I was this moment telling Jane, I thought	302:324,30I  !
5I	you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us."	302:324,31I  !
5E	"Jane|"~	302:324,32E  !
5E	"That is easy~ but Miss Fairfax	302:324,33E  !
5E	does not disapprove it, I suppose."	302:324,34E  !
5A	"How do you like Mrs% Elton?"	302:324,35A  !
5E	"Not at all."	302:324,37E  !
5A	"You are ungrateful."	302:324,38A  !
5E	"Ungrateful|~ What do you mean?"	302:325, 1E  !
5E	"No, do not tell me~ I do not	302:325, 2E  !
5E	want to know what you mean.~ Where is my father?~	302:325, 3E  !
5E	When are we to begin dancing?"	302:325, 4E  !
5N	"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?"	302:325,14N  !
5N	"She will think Frank ought to ask her."	302:325,15N  !
5O	"Do not you dance, Mr% Elton?"	302:327,20O  !
5O	"Me|~ oh| no~ I would get you a better partner than	302:327,23O  !
5O	myself. I am no dancer."	302:327,24O  !
5O	"Mrs% Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is	302:327,30O  !
5O	a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to	302:327,31O  !
5O	see dancing~ Miss Smith."	302:327,32O  !
5I	"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith|~	302:328,29I  !
5I	Very goodnatured, I declare."	302:328,30I  !
5D	"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?~ Here is	302:328,35D  !
5D	your tippet. Mrs% Weston begs you to put on your	302:328,36D  !
5D	tippet. She says she is afraid there will be draughts	302:328,37D  !
5D	in the passage, though every thing has been done~ one	302:328,38D  !
5D	door nailed up~ Quantities of matting~ My dear Jane,	302:329, 1D  !
5D	indeed you must. Mr% Churchill, oh| you are too obliging|	302:329, 2D  !
5D	How well you put it on|~ so gratified| Excellent dancing	302:329, 3D  !
5D	indeed|~ Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to	302:329, 4D  !
5D	help grandmamma to bed, and got back again, and nobody	302:329, 5D  !
5D	missed me.~ I set off without saying a word, just as I told	302:329, 6D  !
5D	you. Grandmamma was quite well, had a charming	302:329, 7D  !
5D	evening with Mr% Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and	302:329, 8D  !
5D	backgammon.~ Tea was made down stairs, biscuits and	302:329, 9D  !
5D	baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing	302:329,10D  !
5D	luck in some of her throws: and she inquired a great deal	302:329,11D  !
5D	about you, how you were amused, and who were your	302:329,12D  !
5D	partners. ""Oh|"" said I, ""I shall not forestall Jane;	302:329,13D  !
5D	I left her dancing with Mr% George Otway; she will love	302:329,14D  !
5D	to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first	302:329,15D  !
5D	partner was Mr% Elton, I do not know who will ask her	302:329,16D  !
5D	next, perhaps Mr% William Cox."" My dear sir, you are	302:329,17D  !
5D	too obliging.~ Is there nobody you would not rather?~	302:329,18D  !
5D	I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my	302:329,19D  !
5D	word, Jane on one arm, and me on the other|~ Stop, stop,	302:329,20D  !
5D	let us stand a little back, Mrs% Elton is going; dear	302:329,21D  !
5D	Mrs% Elton, how elegant she looks|~ Beautiful lace|~ Now	302:329,22D  !
5D	we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening|	302:329,23D  !
5D	~ Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take	302:329,24D  !
5D	care of the two steps. Oh| no, there is but one. Well,	302:329,25D  !
5D	I was persuaded there were two. How very odd| I	302:329,26D  !
5D	was convinced there were two, and there is but one.	302:329,27D  !
5D	I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style~	302:329,28D  !
5D	Candles every where.~ I was telling you of your grandmamma,	302:329,29D  !
5D	Jane,~ There was a little disappointment.~ The	302:329,30D  !
5D	baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you	302:329,31D  !
5D	know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread	302:329,32D  !
5D	and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr% Woodhouse,	302:329,33D  !
5D	not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough,	302:329,34D  !
5D	sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmamma	302:329,35D  !
5D	loves better than sweetbread and asparagus~ so she was	302:329,36D  !
5D	rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak	302:329,37D  !
5D	of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear	302:329,38D  !
5D	Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned|~	302:330, 1D  !
5D	Well, this is brilliant| I am all amazement| could not	302:330, 2D  !
5D	have supposed any thing|~ Such elegance and profusion|	302:330, 3D  !
5D	~ I have seen nothing like it since~ Well, where shall we	302:330, 4D  !
5D	sit? where shall we sit? Any where, so that Jane is not	302:330, 5D  !
5D	in a draught. Where \I\ sit is of no consequence. Oh| do	302:330, 6D  !
5D	you recommend this side?~ Well, I am sure, Mr% Churchill	302:330, 7D  !
5D	~ only it seems too good~ but just as you please. What	302:330, 8D  !
5D	you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how	302:330, 9D  !
5D	shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmamma?	302:330,10D  !
5D	Soup too| Bless me| I should not be helped so soon, but	302:330,11D  !
5D	it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning."	302:330,12D  !
5B	"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,"	302:330,20B  !
5B	"Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?"	302:330,21B  !
5B	"\She\ ought not to be angry with you,	302:330,23B  !
5B	I suspect, whatever he may be.~ To that surmise, you say	302:330,24B  !
5B	nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did	302:330,25B  !
5B	want him to marry Harriet."	302:330,26B  !
5A	"I did,"	302:330,27A  !
5A	"and they cannot forgive me."	302:330,27A  !
5B	"I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own	302:330,30B  !
5B	reflections."	302:330,31B  !
5A	"Can you trust me with such flatterers?~ Does my	302:330,32A  !
5A	vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?"	302:330,33A  !
5B	"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.~ If one	302:330,34B  !
5B	leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."	302:330,35B  !
5A	"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken	302:330,36A  !
5A	in Mr% Elton. There is a littleness about him which you	302:330,37A  !
5A	discovered, and which I did not: and I was fully convinced	302:330,38A  !
5A	of his being in love with Harriet. It was through	302:331, 1A  !
5A	a series of strange blunders|"	302:331, 2A  !
5B	"And, in return for your acknowledging so much,	302:331, 3B  !
5B	I will do you the justice to say, that you would have	302:331, 4B  !
5B	chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.~	302:331, 5B  !
5B	Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs% Elton	302:331, 6B  !
5B	is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded,	302:331, 7B  !
5B	artless girl~ infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense	302:331, 8B  !
5B	and taste to such a woman as Mrs% Elton. I found Harriet	302:331, 9B  !
5B	more conversable than I expected."	302:331,10B  !
5N	"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax,	302:331,14N  !
5N	what are you all doing?~ Come Emma, set your companions	302:331,15N  !
5N	the example. Every body is lazy| Every body	302:331,16N  !
5N	is asleep|"	302:331,17N  !
5A	"I am ready,"	302:331,18A  !
5A	"whenever I am wanted."	302:331,18A  !
5B	"Whom are you going to dance with?"	302:331,19B  !
5A	"With you,	302:331,21A  !
5A	if you will ask me."	302:331,22A  !
5B	"Will you?"	302:331,23B  !
5A	"Indeed I will. You have shown that you can dance,	302:331,24A  !
5A	and you know we are not really so much brother and sister	302:331,25A  !
5A	as to make it at all improper."	302:331,26A  !
5B	"Brother and sister| no, indeed."	302:331,27B  !
5M	"Miss Woodhouse~ if you are at leisure~ I have something	304:337, 5M  !
5M	that I should like to tell you~ a sort of confession	304:337, 6M  !
5M	to make~ and then, you know, it will be over."	304:337, 7M  !
5M	"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,"	304:337,12M  !
5M	"to have no reserves with you on this subject.	304:337,13M  !
5M	As I am happily quite an altered creature in \one\ \respect\, it	304:337,14M  !
5M	is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing	304:337,15M  !
5M	it. I do not want to say more than is necessary~ I am too	304:337,16M  !
5M	much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and	304:337,17M  !
5M	I dare say you understand me."	304:337,18M  !
5A	"Yes,"	304:337,19A  !
5A	"I hope I do."	304:337,19A  !
5M	"How I could so long a time be fancying myself|~~"	304:337,20M  !
5M	"It seems like madness| I can see	304:337,21M  !
5M	nothing at all extraordinary in him now.~ I do not care	304:337,22M  !
5M	whether I meet him or not~ except that of the two I had	304:337,23M  !
5M	rather not see him~ and indeed I would go any distance	304:337,24M  !
5M	round to avoid him~ but I do not envy his wife in the	304:337,25M  !
5M	least; I neither admire her nor envy her, as I have done:	304:337,26M  !
5M	she is very charming, I dare say, and all that, but I think	304:337,27M  !
5M	her very ill-tempered and disagreeable~ I shall never	304:337,28M  !
5M	forget her look the other night|~ However, I assure you,	304:337,29M  !
5M	Miss Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.~ No, let them be	304:337,30M  !
5M	ever so happy together, it will not give me another	304:337,31M  !
5M	moment's pang: and to convince you that I have been	304:337,32M  !
5M	speaking truth, I am now going to destroy~ what I ought	304:337,33M  !
5M	to have destroyed long ago~ what I ought never to have	304:338, 1M  !
5M	kept~ I know that very well	304:338, 2M  !
5M	However, now I will destroy it all~ and it is my particular	304:338, 3M  !
5M	wish to do it in your presence, that you may see how	304:338, 4M  !
5M	rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel	304:338, 5M  !
5M	holds?"	304:338, 6M  !
5A	"Not the least in the world.~ Did he ever give you any thing?"	304:338, 7A  !
5M	"No~ I cannot call them gifts; but they are things	304:338, 9M  !
5M	that I have valued very much."	304:338,10M  !
5M	"Now,"	304:338,19M  !
5M	"you \must\ recollect,"	304:338,19M  !
5A	"No, indeed I do not."	304:338,20A  !
5M	"Dear me| I should not have thought it possible you	304:338,21M  !
5M	could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister,	304:338,22M  !
5M	one of the very last times we ever met in it|~ It	304:338,23M  !
5M	was but a very few days before I had my sore throat~	304:338,24M  !
5M	just before Mr% and Mrs% John Knightley came~ I think	304:338,25M  !
5M	the very evening.~ Do not you remember his cutting his	304:338,26M  !
5M	finger with your new penknife, and your recommending	304:338,27M  !
5M	court plaister?~ But as you had none about you, and	304:338,28M  !
5M	knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took	304:338,29M  !
5M	mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too	304:338,30M  !
5M	large, and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time	304:338,31M  !
5M	with what was left, before he gave it back to me. And so	304:338,32M  !
5M	then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure	304:338,33M  !
5M	of it~ so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now	304:338,34M  !
5M	and then as a great treat."	304:338,35M  !
5A	"My dearest Harriet|"	304:338,36A  !
5A	"you make me more	304:338,37A  !
5A	ashamed of myself than I can bear. Remember it? Ay,	304:338,38A  !
5A	I remember it all now; all, except your saving this	304:339, 1A  !
5A	relick~ I knew nothing of that till this moment~ but	304:339, 2A  !
5A	the cutting the finger, and my recommending court plaister,	304:339, 3A  !
5A	and saying I had none about me|~ Oh| my sins,	304:339, 4A  !
5A	my sins|~ And I had plenty all the while in my pocket|~	304:339, 5A  !
5A	One of my senseless tricks|~ I deserve to be under a continual	304:339, 6A  !
5A	blush all the rest of my life.~ Well~	304:339, 7A  !
5A	go on~ what else?"	304:339, 8A  !
5M	"And had you really some at hand yourself?~ I am sure	304:339, 9M  !
5M	I never suspected it, you did it so naturally."	304:339,10M  !
5A	"And so you actually put this piece of court plaister	304:339,11A  !
5A	by for his sake|"	304:339,12A  !
5M	"Here,"	304:339,18M  !
5M	"here is something still more valuable, I mean that \has\	304:339,19M  !
5M	\been\ more valuable, because this is what did really once	304:339,20M  !
5M	belong to him, which the court plaister never did."	304:339,21M  !
5M	"This was really his,"	304:339,24M  !
5M	"Do not you	304:339,24M  !
5M	remember one morning?~ no, I dare say you do not. But	304:339,25M  !
5M	one morning~ I forget exactly the day~ but perhaps it	304:339,26M  !
5M	was the Tuesday or Wednesday before \that\ \evening\, he	304:339,27M  !
5M	wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it	304:339,28M  !
5M	was about spruce beer. Mr% Knightley had been telling	304:339,29M  !
5M	him something about brewing spruce beer, and he wanted	304:339,30M  !
5M	to put it down; but when he took out his pencil, there was	304:339,31M  !
5M	so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and it would	304:339,32M  !
5M	not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the	304:339,33M  !
5M	table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and,	304:339,34M  !
5M	as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it	304:339,35M  !
5M	again from that moment."	304:339,36M  !
5A	"I do remember it,"	304:339,37A  !
5A	"I perfectly	304:339,37A  !
5A	remember it.~ Talking about spruce beer.~ Oh| yes~	304:339,38A  !
5A	Mr% Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and Mr% Elton's	304:340, 1A  !
5A	seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I perfectly	304:340, 2A  !
5A	remember it.~ Stop; Mr% Knightley was standing just	304:340, 3A  !
5A	here, was not he?~ I have an idea he was standing just	304:340, 4A  !
5A	here."	304:340, 5A  !
5M	"Ah| I do not know. I cannot recollect.~ It is very	304:340, 6M  !
5M	odd, but I cannot recollect.~ Mr% Elton was sitting here,	304:340, 7M  !
5M	I remember, much about where I am now."~	304:340, 8M  !
5A	"Well, go on."	304:340, 9A  !
5M	"Oh| that's all. I have nothing more to show you,	304:340,10M  !
5M	or to say~ except that I am now going to throw them	304:340,11M  !
5M	both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it."	304:340,12M  !
5A	"My poor dear Harriet| and have you actually found	304:340,13A  !
5A	happiness in treasuring up these things?"	304:340,14A  !
5M	"Yes, simpleton as I was|~ but I am quite ashamed	304:340,15M  !
5M	of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn	304:340,16M  !
5M	them. It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any	304:340,17M  !
5M	remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was~	304:340,18M  !
5M	but had not resolution enough to part with them."	304:340,19M  !
5A	"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court plaister?	304:340,20A  !
5A	~ I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the	304:340,21A  !
5A	court plaister might be useful."	304:340,22A  !
5M	"I shall be happier to burn it,"	304:340,23M  !
5M	"It	304:340,23M  !
5M	has a disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.~	304:340,24M  !
5M	There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven|	304:340,25M  !
5M	of Mr% Elton."	304:340,26M  !
5A	"Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise	304:340,37A  !
5A	you to do so and so"~	304:340,38A  !
5M	"I shall never marry."	304:341, 2M  !
5A	"Never marry|~ This is a new resolution."	304:341, 6A  !
5M	"It is one that I shall never change, however."	304:341, 7M  !
5A	"I hope it does not	304:341, 8A  !
5A	proceed from~ I hope it is not in compliment to	304:341, 9A  !
5A	Mr% Elton?"	304:341,10A  !
5M	"Mr% Elton indeed|"	304:341,11M  !
5M	"Oh|	304:341,11M  !
5M	no"~	304:341,12M  !
5M	"so superior	304:341,12M  !
5M	to Mr% Elton|"	304:341,13M  !
5A	"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your	304:341,28A  !
5A	meaning. Your resolution, or rather your expectation of	304:341,29A  !
5A	never marrying, results from an idea that the person	304:341,30A  !
5A	whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your	304:341,31A  !
5A	superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?"	304:341,32A  !
5M	"Oh| Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the	304:341,33M  !
5M	presumption to suppose~ Indeed I am not so mad.~ But	304:341,34M  !
5M	it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance~ and to	304:341,35M  !
5M	think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world,	304:341,36M  !
5M	with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so	304:341,37M  !
5M	proper, in me especially."	304:341,38M  !
5A	"I am not at all surprised at you, Harriet. The service	304:342, 1A  !
5A	he rendered you was enough to warm your heart."	304:342, 2A  !
5M	"Service| oh| it was such an inexpressible obligation|	304:342, 3M  !
5M	~ the very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time	304:342, 4M  !
5M	~ when I saw him coming~ his noble look~ and my	304:342, 5M  !
5M	wretchedness before. Such a change| In one moment	304:342, 6M  !
5M	such a change| From perfect misery to perfect happiness."	304:342, 7M  !
5A	"It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.	304:342, 8A  !
5A	~ Yes, honourable, I think, to choose so well and so gratefully.~	304:342, 9A  !
5A	But that it will be a fortunate preference is more	304:342,10A  !
5A	than I can promise. I do not advise you to give way to it,	304:342,11A  !
5A	Harriet. I do not by any means engage for its being	304:342,12A  !
5A	returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be	304:342,13A  !
5A	wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at	304:342,14A  !
5A	any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are	304:342,15A  !
5A	persuaded of his liking you. Be observant of him. Let	304:342,16A  !
5A	his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I give you	304:342,17A  !
5A	this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again	304:342,18A  !
5A	on the subject. I am determined against all interference.	304:342,19A  !
5A	Henceforward I know nothing of the matter. Let no name	304:342,20A  !
5A	ever pass our lips. We were very wrong before; we will	304:342,21A  !
5A	be cautious now.~ He is your superior, no doubt, and there	304:342,22A  !
5A	do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature;	304:342,23A  !
5A	but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place,	304:342,24A  !
5A	there have been matches of greater disparity. But take	304:342,25A  !
5A	care of yourself. I would not have you too sanguine;	304:342,26A  !
5A	though, however it may end, be assured that your raising	304:342,27A  !
5A	your thoughts to \him\, is a mark of good taste which I shall	304:342,28A  !
5A	always know how to value."	304:342,29A  !
5E	"By the bye,"	305:344,27E  !
5E	"what became of Mr% Perry's plan of setting up	305:344,28E  !
5E	his carriage?"	305:344,29E  !
5O	"I did not	305:344,30O  !
5O	know that he ever had any such plan."	305:344,31O  !
5E	"Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it	305:344,32E  !
5E	three months ago."	305:344,33E  !
5O	"Me| impossible|"	305:344,34O  !
5E	"Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You	305:344,35E  !
5E	mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon.	305:344,36E  !
5E	Mrs% Perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy	305:344,37E  !
5E	about it. It was owing to \her\ persuasion, as she thought his	305:344,38E  !
5E	being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm.	305:345, 1E  !
5E	You must remember it now?"	305:345, 2E  !
5O	"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."	305:345, 3O  !
5E	"Never| really, never|~ Bless me| how could it be?	305:345, 4E  !
5E	~ Then I must have dreamt it~ but I was completely	305:345, 5E  !
5E	persuaded~ Miss Smith, you walk as if you were tired.	305:345, 6E  !
5E	You will not be sorry to find yourself at home."	305:345, 7E  !
5N	"What is this?~ what is this?"	305:345, 8N  !
5N	"about Perry and a carriage? Is Perry going to set up	305:345, 9N  !
5N	his carriage, Frank? I am glad he can afford it. You had	305:345,10N  !
5N	it from himself, had you?"	305:345,11N  !
5E	"No, sir,"	305:345,12E  !
5E	"I seem to have	305:345,12E  !
5E	had it from nobody.~ Very odd|~ I really was persuaded	305:345,13E  !
5E	of Mrs% Weston's having mentioned it in one of	305:345,14E  !
5E	her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these	305:345,15E  !
5E	particulars~ but as she declares she never heard a syllable	305:345,16E  !
5E	of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am	305:345,17E  !
5E	a great dreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury	305:345,18E  !
5E	when I am away~ and when I have gone through my	305:345,19E  !
5E	particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr% and	305:345,20E  !
5E	Mrs% Perry."	305:345,21E  !
5N	"It is odd though,"	305:345,22N  !
5N	"that you	305:345,22N  !
5N	should have had such a regular connected dream about	305:345,23N  !
5N	people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking	305:345,24N  !
5N	of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage| and his	305:345,25N  !
5N	wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health~ just	305:345,26N  !
5N	what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other;	305:345,27N  !
5N	only a little premature. What an air of probability	305:345,28N  !
5N	sometimes runs through a dream| And at others, what	305:345,29N  !
5N	a heap of absurdities it is| Well, Frank, your dream	305:345,30N  !
5N	certainly shows that Highbury is in your thoughts	305:345,31N  !
5N	when you are absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I	305:345,32N  !
5N	think?"	305:345,33N  !
5D	"Why, to own the truth,"	305:345,37D  !
5D	"if	305:345,38D  !
5D	I must speak on this subject, there is no denying that	305:346, 1D  !
5D	Mr% Frank Churchill might have~ I do not mean to say	305:346, 2D  !
5D	that he did not dream it~ I am sure I have sometimes the	305:346, 3D  !
5D	oddest dreams in the world~ but if I am questioned about	305:346, 4D  !
5D	it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last	305:346, 5D  !
5D	spring; for Mrs% Perry herself mentioned it to my mother,	305:346, 6D  !
5D	and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves~ but it was	305:346, 7D  !
5D	quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought	305:346, 8D  !
5D	of about three days. Mrs% Perry was very anxious that	305:346, 9D  !
5D	he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great	305:346,10D  !
5D	spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed.	305:346,11D  !
5D	Jane, don't you remember grandmamma's telling us of it	305:346,12D  !
5D	when we got home?~ I forget where we had been walking	305:346,13D  !
5D	to~ very likely to Randall's; yes, I think it was to	305:346,14D  !
5D	Randall's. Mrs% Perry was always particularly fond of	305:346,15D  !
5D	my mother~ indeed I do not know who is not~ and she	305:346,16D  !
5D	had mentioned it to her in confidence; she had no objection	305:346,17D  !
5D	to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go	305:346,18D  !
5D	beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned	305:346,19D  !
5D	it to a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not	305:346,20D  !
5D	positively answer for my having never dropt a hint,	305:346,21D  !
5D	because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before	305:346,22D  !
5D	I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather	305:346,23D  !
5D	a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me	305:346,24D  !
5D	which I should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were.	305:346,25D  !
5D	I will answer for it \she\ never betrayed the least thing in	305:346,26D  !
5D	the world. Where is she?~ Oh| just behind. Perfectly	305:346,27D  !
5D	remember Mrs% Perry's coming.~ Extraordinary dream	305:346,28D  !

5B	great amusement, the poignant sting of the last word	305:349,35B  !
5B	given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the word, and am	305:349,36B  !
5B	curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to	305:349,37B  !
5B	the one, and so very distressing to the other."	305:349,38B  !
5A	"Oh|"	305:350, 5A  !
5A	"it all	305:350, 5A  !
5A	meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."	305:350, 6A  !
5B	"The joke,"	305:350, 7B  !

5B	"Have you never at any time had reason to think that	305:350,25B  !

5A	your head?"	305:350,30A  !
5B	"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of	305:350,31B  !
5B	attachment between them~ certain expressive looks,	305:350,32B  !
5B	which I did not believe meant to be public."	305:350,33B  !
5A	"Oh| you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to	305:350,34A  !

5A	wander~ but it will not do~ very sorry to check you in	305:350,36A  !
5A	your first essay~ but indeed it will not do. There is no	305:350,37A  !
5A	admiration between them, I do assure you; and the	305:350,38A  !
5A	appearances which have caught you, have arisen from	305:351, 1A  !
5A	some peculiar circumstances~ feelings rather of a totally	305:351, 2A  !
5A	different nature:~ it is impossible exactly to explain:~	305:351, 3A  !
5A	there is a good deal of nonsense in it~ but the part which	305:351, 4A  !

5A	they are as far from any attachment or admiration for	305:351, 6A  !
5A	one another, as any two beings in the world can be. That	305:351, 7A  !
5A	is, I \presume\ it to be so on her side, and I can \answer\ for	305:351, 8A  !

5N	"But I thought you would. Such	306:353,21N  !
5N	schemes as these are nothing without numbers. One	306:353,22N  !
5N	cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its	306:353,23N  !

5I	disappointments are quite odious. What are we to do?~	306:354, 1I  !
5I	The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.	306:354, 2I  !
5I	Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful	306:354, 3I  !
5I	exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."	306:354, 4I  !
5B	"You had better explore to Donwell,"	306:354, 5B  !
5B	"That may be done without horses. Come,	306:354, 6B  !
5B	and eat my strawberries. They are ripening fast."	306:354, 7B  !

5I	"I certainly	306:354,19I  !
5I	will come. Name your day, and I will come. You will	306:354,20I  !
5I	allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?"	306:354,21I  !

5I	I am Lady Patroness, you know. It is my	306:354,25I  !
5I	party. I will bring friends with me."	306:354,26I  !

5I	"Oh| now you are looking very sly. But consider;~	306:354,29I  !
5I	you need not be afraid of delegating power to \me\. I am	306:354,30I  !
5I	no young lady on her preferment. Married women, you	306:354,31I  !
5I	know, may be safely authorized. It is my party. Leave	306:354,32I  !
5I	it all to me. I will invite your guests."	306:354,33I  !
5B	"No,"~	306:354,34B  !
5B	"there is but one married	306:354,34B  !
5B	woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what	306:354,35B  !

5I	"~ Mrs% Weston, I suppose,"	306:354,37I  !

5I	"Ah| you are an odd creature|"	306:355, 3I  !
5I	"You are a humourist,	306:355, 4I  !
5I	and may say what you like. Quite a humourist. Well,	306:355, 5I  !
5I	I shall bring Jane with me~ Jane and her aunt.~ The rest	306:355, 6I  !
5I	I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting the	306:355, 7I  !
5I	Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached	306:355, 8I  !
5I	to them."	306:355, 9I  !
5B	"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and	306:355,10B  !
5B	I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home."	306:355,11B  !
5I	"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:~	306:355,12I  !
5I	but as you like. It is to be a morning scheme, you know,	306:355,13I  !
5I	Knightley; quite a simple thing. I shall wear a large	306:355,14I  !
5I	bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my	306:355,15I  !
5I	arm. Here,~ probably this basket with pink ribbon.	306:355,16I  !
5I	Nothing can be more simple, you see. And Jane will have	306:355,17I  !
5I	such another. There is to be no form or parade~ a sort	306:355,18I  !
5I	of gipsy party.~ We are to walk about your gardens, and	306:355,19I  !
5I	gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under trees;~	306:355,20I  !
5I	and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all	306:355,21I  !
5I	out of doors~ a table spread in the shade, you know.	306:355,22I  !
5I	Every thing as natural and simple as possible. Is not	306:355,23I  !
5I	that your idea?"	306:355,24I  !
5B	"Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural	306:355,25B  !
5B	will be to have the table spread in the dining-room. The	306:355,26B  !
5B	nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with	306:355,27B  !
5B	their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by	306:355,28B  !
5B	meals within doors. When you are tired of eating strawberries	306:355,29B  !
5B	in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house."	306:355,30B  !
5I	"Well~ as you please; only don't have a great set out.	306:355,31I  !
5I	And, by the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use	306:355,32I  !
5I	to you with our opinion?~ Pray be sincere, Knightley.	306:355,33I  !
5I	If you wish me to talk to Mrs% Hodges, or to inspect	306:355,34I  !
5I	anything~."	306:355,35I  !
5B	"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."	306:355,36B  !
5I	"Well~ but if any difficulties should arise, my house-keeper	306:355,37I  !
5I	is extremely clever."	306:355,38I  !
5B	"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as	306:356, 1B  !
5B	clever, and would spurn anybody's assistance."	306:356, 2B  !
5I	"I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us	306:356, 3I  !
5I	all to come on donkies, Jane, Miss Bates, and me~ and my	306:356, 4I  !
5I	caro sposo walking by. I really must talk to him about	306:356, 5I  !
5I	purchasing a donkey. In a country life I conceive it to	306:356, 6I  !
5I	be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so many	306:356, 7I  !
5I	resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up	306:356, 8I  !
5I	at home;~ and very long walks, you know~ in summer	306:356, 9I  !
5I	there is dust, and in winter there is dirt."	306:356,10I  !
5B	"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury.	306:356,11B  !
5B	Donwell-lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly	306:356,12B  !
5B	dry. Come on a donkey, however, if you prefer it. You	306:356,13B  !
5B	can borrow Mrs% Cole's. I would wish every thing to be	306:356,14B  !
5B	as much to your taste as possible."	306:356,15B  !
5I	"That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice,	306:356,16I  !
5I	my good friend. Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt	306:356,17I  !
5I	manner, I know you have the warmest heart. As I tell	306:356,18I  !
5I	Mr% E%, you are a thorough humourist.~ Yes, believe me,	306:356,19I  !
5I	Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in	306:356,20I  !
5I	the whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very	306:356,21I  !
5I	thing to please me."	306:356,22I  !
5P	"Some very	306:356,32P  !
5P	fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go very	306:356,33P  !
5P	well; and he could sit still with Mrs% Weston, while the	306:356,34P  !
5P	dear girls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose	306:356,35P  !
5P	they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He	306:356,36P  !
5P	should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and	306:356,37P  !
5P	should be very happy to meet Mr% and Mrs% Elton, and	306:356,38P  !

5E	a doubt of getting over to them."~	306:361,18E  !
5A	"Certainly, if you wish it;~ but you are not going to	306:362,28A  !
5A	walk to Highbury alone?"	306:362,29A  !
5A	"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite	306:362,32A  !

5A	the carriage. It can be round in five minutes."	306:362,34A  !
5A	"That can be no reason for your being	306:363, 1A  !
5A	exposed to danger now. I must order the carriage.	306:363, 2A  !
5A	The heat even would be danger.~ You are fatigued	306:363, 3A  !

5A	"Such a home, indeed| such an aunt|"	306:363,20A  !

5E	coming| You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole	306:364, 8E  !

5E	weather|~ absolute madness|"	306:364,10E  !
5E	"No~ he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would	306:364,20E  !
5E	only make him hotter."	306:364,21E  !
5A	"I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should	306:364,25A  !
5A	not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot	306:364,26A  !
5A	morning. Harriet's sweet easy temper will not mind it."	306:364,27A  !
5E	"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,"	306:364,36E  !
5E	"I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these	306:364,37E  !
5E	places. You will have my sketches, some time or other,	306:364,38E  !
5E	to look at~ or my tour to read~ or my poem. I shall do	306:365, 1E  !
5E	something to expose myself."	306:365, 2E  !
5A	"That may be~ but not by sketches in Swisserland.	306:365, 3A  !
5A	You will never go to Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt	306:365, 4A  !
5A	will never allow you to leave England."	306:365, 5A  !
5E	"They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may	306:365, 6E  !
5E	be prescribed for her. I have more than half an expectation	306:365, 7E  !
5E	of our all going abroad. I assure you I have. I feel	306:365, 8E  !
5E	a strong persuasion, this morning, that I shall soon be	306:365, 9E  !
5E	abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing.	306:365,10E  !
5E	I want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever	306:365,11E  !
5E	your penetrating eyes may fancy~ I am sick of	306:365,12E  !
5E	England~ and would leave it to-morrow, if I could."	306:365,13E  !
5A	"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot	306:365,14A  !
5A	you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented	306:365,15A  !
5A	to stay?"	306:365,16A  !
5E	"\I\ sick of prosperity and indulgence|~ You are quite	306:365,17E  !
5E	mistaken. I do not look upon myself as either prosperous	306:365,18E  !
5E	or indulged. I am thwarted in every thing material. I do	306:365,19E  !
5E	not consider myself at all a fortunate person."	306:365,20E  !
5A	"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you	306:365,21A  !
5A	first came. Go and eat and drink a little more, and you	306:365,22A  !
5A	will do very well. Another slice of cold meat, another	306:365,23A  !
5A	draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on	306:365,24A  !
5A	a par with the rest of us."	306:365,25A  !
5E	"No~ I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my	306:365,26E  !
5E	best cure."	306:365,27E  !
5A	"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;~ you will join	306:365,28A  !
5A	us. It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for	306:365,29A  !
5A	a young man so much in want of a change. You will stay,	306:365,30A  !
5A	and go with us?"	306:365,31A  !
5E	"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the	306:365,32E  !
5E	evening."	306:365,33E  !
5A	"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow	306:365,34A  !
5A	morning."	306:365,35A  !
5E	"No~ It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be	306:365,36E  !
5E	cross."	306:365,37E  !
5A	"Then pray stay at Richmond."	306:365,38A  !
5E	"But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear	306:366, 1E  !
5E	to think of you all there without me."	306:366, 2E  !
5A	"These are difficulties which you must settle for	306:366, 3A  !
5A	yourself. Choose your own degree of crossness. I shall	306:366, 4A  !
5A	press you no more."	306:366, 5A  !
5E	"Well;~ if \you\ wish me to stay, and join the party,	306:366,16E  !
5E	I will."	306:366,17E  !
5E	"How much I am obliged to you,"	307:368,23E  !
5E	"for telling	307:368,23E  !
5E	me to come to day|~ If it had not been for you, I should	307:368,24E  !
5E	certainly have lost all the happiness of this party. I had	307:368,25E  !
5E	quite determined to go away again."	307:368,26E  !
5A	"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what	307:368,27A  !
5A	about, except that you were too late for the best strawberries.	307:368,28A  !
5A	I was a kinder friend than you deserved. But	307:368,29A  !
5A	you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded	307:368,30A  !
5A	to come."	307:368,31A  !
5E	"Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat	307:368,32E  !
5E	overcame me."	307:368,33E  !
5A	"It is hotter to-day."	307:368,34A  !
5E	"Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable	307:368,35E  !
5E	to-day."	307:368,36E  !
5A	"You are comfortable because you are under command."	307:368,37A  !
5E	"Your command?~ Yes."	307:368,38E  !
5A	"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command.	307:369, 1A  !
5A	You had, somehow or other, broken bounds	307:369, 2A  !
5A	yesterday, and run away from your own management;	307:369, 3A  !
5A	but to-day you are got back again~ and as I cannot be	307:369, 4A  !
5A	always with you, it is best to believe your temper under	307:369, 5A  !
5A	your own command rather than mine."	307:369, 6A  !
5E	"It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command	307:369, 7E  !
5E	without a motive. You order me, whether you	307:369, 8E  !
5E	speak or not. And you can be always with me. You are	307:369, 9E  !
5E	always with me."	307:369,10E  !
5A	"Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual	307:369,11A  !
5A	influence could not begin earlier, or you would not have	307:369,12A  !
5A	been so much out of humour before."	307:369,13A  !
5E	"Three o'clock yesterday| That is your date. I	307:369,14E  !
5E	thought I had seen you first in February."	307:369,15E  !
5A	"Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But	307:369,16A  !
5A	nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is	307:369,17A  !
5A	rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment	307:369,18A  !
5A	of seven silent people."	307:369,19A  !
5E	"I say nothing of which I am ashamed,"	307:369,20E  !
5E	"I saw you first in February.	307:369,21E  !
5E	Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can. Let my	307:369,22E  !
5E	accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking on	307:369,23E  !
5E	the other. I saw you first in February."	307:369,24E  !
5E	"Our companions are excessively stupid.	307:369,25E  !
5E	What shall we do to rouse them? Any nonsense will	307:369,26E  !
5E	serve. They \shall\ talk. Ladies and gentlemen, I am	307:369,27E  !
5E	ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides,)	307:369,28E  !
5E	to say, that she desires to know what you are all	307:369,29E  !
5E	thinking of."	307:369,30E  !
5B	"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear	307:369,35B  !
5B	what we are all thinking of?"	307:369,36B  !
5A	"Oh| no, no"~	307:369,37A  !
5A	"Upon no account in the world. It is the	307:369,38A  !
5A	very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now. Let	307:370, 1A  !
5A	me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of.	307:370, 2A  !
5A	I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps,	307:370, 3A  !
5A	whose thoughts	307:370, 4A  !
5A	I might not be afraid of knowing."	307:370, 5A  !
5I	"It is a sort of thing,"	307:370, 6I  !
5I	"which \I\ should not have thought myself privileged to	307:370, 7I  !
5I	inquire into. Though, perhaps, as the \Chaperon\ of the	307:370, 8I  !
5I	party~ \I\ never was in any circle~ exploring parties~	307:370, 9I  !
5I	young ladies~ married women~"	307:370,10I  !

5E	"they	307:370,17E  !
5E	are most of them affronted. I will attack them with more	307:370,18E  !
5E	address. Ladies and gentlemen~ I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse	307:370,19E  !
5E	to say, that she waves her right of knowing	307:370,20E  !
5E	exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires	307:370,21E  !
5E	something very entertaining from each of you, in a general	307:370,22E  !
5E	way. Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is	307:370,23E  !
5E	pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she	307:370,24E  !
5E	only demands from each of you either one thing very	307:370,25E  !
5E	clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated~ or two	307:370,26E  !
5E	things moderately clever~ or three things very dull indeed,	307:370,27E  !
5E	and she engages to laugh heartily at them all."	307:370,28E  !
5D	"Oh| very well,"	307:370,29D  !
5D	"then I need	307:370,29D  !
5D	not be uneasy. ""Three things very dull indeed."" That	307:370,30D  !
5D	will just do for me, you know. I shall be sure to say three	307:370,31D  !
5D	dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan't I?~	307:370,32D  !
5D	Do not you all think I shall?"	307:370,34D  !
5A	"Ah| ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon	307:370,36A  !
5A	me~ but you will be limited as to number~ only three at	307:370,37A  !
5A	once."	307:370,38A  !
5D	"Ah|~ well~ to be sure. Yes, I see what she means,	307:371, 5D  !
5D	and I will try to hold my	307:371, 6D  !
5D	tongue. I must make myself very disagreeable, or she	307:371, 7D  !
5D	would not have said such a thing to an old friend."	307:371, 8D  !
5N	"I like your plan,"	307:371, 9N  !
5N	"Agreed,	307:371, 9N  !
5N	agreed. I will do my best. I am making a conundrum.	307:371,10N  !
5N	How will a conundrum reckon?"	307:371,11N  !
5E	"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,"	307:371,12E  !
5E	"but we shall be indulgent~ especially to any one who	307:371,13E  !
5E	leads the way."	307:371,14E  !
5A	"No, no,"	307:371,15A  !
5A	"it will not reckon low. A	307:371,15A  !
5A	conundrum of Mr% Weston's shall clear him and his next	307:371,16A  !
5A	neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me hear it."	307:371,17A  !
5N	"I doubt it's being very clever myself,"	307:371,18N  !
5N	"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.~ What	307:371,19N  !
5N	two letters of the alphabet are there, that express	307:371,20N  !
5N	perfection?"	307:371,21N  !

5B	"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted,	307:371,33B  !
5B	and Mr% Weston has done very well for himself; but he	307:371,34B  !
5B	must have knocked up every body else. \Perfection\ should	307:371,35B  !
5B	not have come quite so soon."	307:371,36B  !

5I	"\I\ really cannot attempt~ I am not at all	307:371,38I  !
5I	fond of the sort of thing. I had an acrostic once sent to	307:372, 1I  !
5I	me upon my own name, which I was not at all pleased	307:372, 2I  !
5I	with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy|~	307:372, 3I  !
5I	You know who I mean~	307:372, 4I  !
5I	These	307:372, 4I  !
5I	kind of things are very well at Christmas, when one is	307:372, 5I  !
5I	sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in my	307:372, 6I  !
5I	opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer.	307:372, 7I  !
5I	Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those	307:372, 8I  !
5I	who have witty things at every body's service. I do not	307:372, 9I  !
5I	pretend to be a wit. I have a great deal of vivacity in my	307:372,10I  !
5I	own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to	307:372,11I  !
5I	speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please,	307:372,12I  !
5I	Mr% Churchill. Pass Mr% E%, Knightley, Jane and myself.	307:372,13I  !
5I	We have nothing clever to say~ not one of us."	307:372,14I  !

5E	one another|~ Very lucky~ marrying as they did, upon	307:372,25E  !
5E	an acquaintance formed only in a public place|~ They	307:372,26E  !
5E	only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath|	307:372,27E  !
5E	Peculiarly lucky|~ for as to any real knowledge of a person's	307:372,28E  !
5E	disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give~	307:372,29E  !
5E	it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is only	307:372,30E  !
5E	by seeing women in their own homes, among their own	307:372,31E  !
5E	set, just as they always are, that you can form any just	307:372,32E  !
5E	judgment. Short of that, it is all guess and luck~ and	307:372,33E  !
5E	will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed	307:372,34E  !
5E	himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest	307:372,35E  !
5E	of his life|"	307:372,36E  !
5E	"You were speaking,"	307:373, 4E  !
5E	"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment,	307:373,17E  !
5E	that whenever I marry, I hope somebody will choose my	307:373,18E  !
5E	wife for me. Will you?	307:373,19E  !
5E	Will you	307:373,19E  !
5E	choose a wife for me?~ I am sure I should like any body	307:373,20E  !

5E	Find somebody for me. I am	307:373,22E  !

5B	"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been	307:374,27B  !

5B	perhaps, but I must still use it. I cannot see you acting	307:374,29B  !
5B	wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be so	307:374,30B  !
5B	unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent	307:374,31B  !
5B	in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?~	307:374,32B  !
5B	Emma, I had not thought it possible."	307:374,33B  !
5A	"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?~ Nobody	307:374,36A  !
5A	could have helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say	307:374,37A  !
5A	she did not understand me."	307:374,38A  !
5B	"I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning.	307:375, 1B  !
5B	She has talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how	307:375, 2B  !
5B	she talked of it~ with what candour and generosity. I wish	307:375, 3B  !
5B	you could have heard her honouring your forbearance, in	307:375, 4B  !
5B	being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever	307:375, 5B  !
5B	receiving from yourself and your father, when her society	307:375, 6B  !
5B	must be so irksome."	307:375, 7B  !
5A	"Oh|"	307:375, 8A  !
5A	"I know there is not a better	307:375, 8A  !
5A	creature in the world: but you must allow, that what is	307:375, 9A  !
5A	good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately	307:375,10A  !
5A	blended in her."	307:375,11A  !
5B	"They are blended,"	307:375,12B  !
5B	"I acknowledge; and,	307:375,12B  !
5B	were she prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional	307:375,13B  !
5B	prevalence of the ridiculous over the good. Were she	307:375,14B  !
5B	a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless absurdity	307:375,15B  !
5B	to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any	307:375,16B  !
5B	liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation~	307:375,17B  !
5B	but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.	307:375,18B  !
5B	She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was	307:375,19B  !
5B	born to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink	307:375,20B  !
5B	more. Her situation should secure your compassion.	307:375,21B  !
5B	It was badly done, indeed|~ You, whom she had known	307:375,22B  !
5B	from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period	307:375,23B  !
5B	when her notice was an honour, to have you now, in	307:375,24B  !
5B	thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh	307:375,25B  !
5B	at her, humble her~ and before her niece, too~ and before	307:375,26B  !
5B	others, many of whom (certainly \some\,) would be entirely	307:375,27B  !
5B	guided by \your\ treatment of her.~ This is not pleasant to	307:375,28B  !
5B	you, Emma~ and it is very far from pleasant to me; but	307:375,29B  !
5B	I must, I will,~ I will tell you truths while I can, satisfied	307:375,30B  !
5B	with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel,	307:375,31B  !
5B	and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater	307:375,32B  !
5B	justice than you can do now."	307:375,33B  !
5D	"Well, my dear, I shall \say\ you are laid down	308:378,16D  !
5D	upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough."	308:378,17D  !
5D	"Very happy and obliged"~	308:378,28D  !
5D	"Ah| Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are|~ I suppose	308:378,34D  !
5D	you have heard~ and are come to give us joy. This does	308:378,35D  !
5D	not seem much like joy, indeed, in me~	308:378,36D  !
5D	but it will be very trying for us to part	308:378,37D  !
5D	with her, after having had her so long, and she has	308:378,38D  !
5D	a dreadful headach just now, writing all the morning:~	308:379, 1D  !
5D	such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,	308:379, 2D  !
5D	and Mrs% Dixon. ""My dear,"" said I, ""you will	308:379, 3D  !
5D	blind yourself""~ for tears were in her eyes perpetually.	308:379, 4D  !
5D	One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great	308:379, 5D  !
5D	change; and though she is amazingly fortunate~ such	308:379, 6D  !
5D	a situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever	308:379, 7D  !
5D	met with on first going out~ do not think us ungrateful,	308:379, 8D  !
5D	Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune~	308:379, 9D  !
5D	but, poor dear soul| if you were to	308:379,10D  !
5D	see what a headach she has. When one is in great pain,	308:379,11D  !
5D	you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may	308:379,12D  !
5D	deserve. She is as low as possible. To look at her,	308:379,13D  !
5D	nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to	308:379,14D  !
5D	have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not	308:379,15D  !
5D	coming to you~ she is not able~ she is gone into her own	308:379,16D  !
5D	room~ I want her to lie down upon the bed. ""My dear,""	308:379,17D  !
5D	said I, ""I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:"" but,	308:379,18D  !
5D	however, she is not; she is walking about the room.	308:379,19D  !
5D	But, now that she has written her letters, she says she	308:379,20D  !
5D	shall soon be well. She will be extremely sorry to miss	308:379,21D  !
5D	seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will	308:379,22D  !
5D	excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door~ I was	308:379,23D  !
5D	quite ashamed~ but somehow there was a little bustle~	308:379,24D  !
5D	for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and	308:379,25D  !
5D	till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was	308:379,26D  !
5D	coming. ""It is only Mrs% Cole,"" said I, ""depend upon it.	308:379,27D  !
5D	Nobody else would come so early.""	308:379,28D  !
5D	said she,	308:379,28D  !
5D	But then Patty came in, and said it was you.	308:379,30D  !
5D	""Oh|"" said I, ""it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you	308:379,31D  !
5D	will like to see her.""~	308:379,32D  !
5D	said she; and	308:379,32D  !
5D	up she got, and would go away; and that was what made	308:379,33D  !
5D	us keep you waiting~ and extremely sorry and ashamed	308:379,34D  !
5D	we were. ""If you must go, my dear,"" said I, ""you must,	308:379,35D  !
5D	and I will say you are laid down upon the bed."" "	308:379,36D  !
5A	"It	308:380,10A  !
5A	must be a severe trial to them all. She had understood	308:380,11A  !
5A	it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return."	308:380,12A  !
5D	"So very kind|"	308:380,13D  !
5D	"But you are	308:380,13D  !
5D	always kind."	308:380,14D  !
5D	"always;"	308:380,15D  !
5A	"Where~ may I ask?~ is Miss Fairfax going?"	308:380,18A  !
5D	"To a Mrs% Smallridge~ charming woman~ most	308:380,19D  !
5D	superior~ to have the charge of her three little girls~	308:380,20D  !
5D	delightful children. Impossible that any situation could	308:380,21D  !
5D	be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,	308:380,22D  !
5D	Mrs% Suckling's own family, and Mrs% Bragge's; but	308:380,23D  !
5D	Mrs% Smallridge is intimate with both. and in the very	308:380,24D  !
5D	same neighbourhood:~ lives only four miles from Maple Grove.	308:380,25D  !
5D	Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove."	308:380,26D  !
5A	Mrs% Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom	308:380,27A  !
5A	Miss Fairfax owes~"	308:380,28A  !
5D	"Yes, our good Mrs% Elton. The most indefatigable,	308:380,29D  !
5D	true friend. She would not take a denial. She would not	308:380,30D  !
5D	let Jane say ""No;"" for when Jane first heard of it, (it	308:380,31D  !
5D	was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at	308:380,32D  !
5D	Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite	308:380,33D  !
5D	decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons	308:380,34D  !
5D	you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her	308:380,35D  !
5D	mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return,	308:380,36D  !
5D	and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement	308:380,37D  !
5D	at present~ and so she told Mrs% Elton over and over	308:380,38D  !
5D	again~ and I am sure I had no more idea that she would	308:381, 1D  !
5D	change her mind|~ but that good Mrs% Elton, whose judgement	308:381, 2D  !
5D	never fails her, saw farther than I did. It is not	308:381, 3D  !
5D	every body that would have stood out in such a kind way	308:381, 4D  !
5D	as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she	308:381, 5D  !
5D	positively declared she would \not\ write any such denial	308:381, 6D  !
5D	yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would wait ~ and,	308:381, 7D  !
5D	sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that	308:381, 8D  !
5D	Jane should go. Quite a surprise to me| I had not the	308:381, 9D  !
5D	least idea|~ Jane took Mrs% Elton aside, and told her at	308:381,10D  !
5D	once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs% Suckling's	308:381,11D  !
5D	situation, she had come to the resolution of	308:381,12D  !
5D	accepting it.~ I did not know a word of it till it was all	308:381,13D  !
5D	settled."	308:381,14D  !
5A	"You spent the evening with Mrs% Elton?"	308:381,15A  !
5D	"Yes, all of us; Mrs% Elton would have us come. It	308:381,16D  !
5D	was settled so, upon the hill, while we were walking about	308:381,17D  !
5D	with Mr% Knightley.	308:381,18D  !
5D	said she~	308:381,19D  !
5A	"Mr% Knightley was there too, was he?"	308:381,21A  !
5D	"No, not Mr% Knightley; he declined it from the first;	308:381,22D  !
5D	and though I thought he would come, because Mrs% Elton	308:381,23D  !
5D	declared she would not let him off, he did not;~ but my	308:381,24D  !
5D	mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and a very agreeable	308:381,25D  !
5D	evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse,	308:381,26D  !
5D	one must always find agreeable, though every body	308:381,27D  !
5D	seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.	308:381,28D  !
5D	Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing~ and I cannot say	308:381,29D  !
5D	that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it.	308:381,30D  !
5D	However, \I\ shall always think it a very pleasant party,	308:381,31D  !
5D	and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included	308:381,32D  !
5D	me in it."	308:381,33D  !
5A	"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware	308:381,34A  !
5A	of it, had been making up her mind the whole day."	308:381,35A  !
5D	"I dare say she had."	308:381,36D  !
5A	"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome	308:381,37A  !
5A	to her and all her friends~ but I hope her engagement will	308:381,38A  !
5A	have every alleviation that is possible~ I mean, as to the	308:382, 1A  !
5A	character and manners of the family."	308:382, 2A  !
5D	"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed,	308:382, 3D  !
5D	there is every thing in the world that can make her happy	308:382, 4D  !
5D	in it. Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is not	308:382, 5D  !
5D	such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant,	308:382, 6D  !
5D	in all Mrs% Elton's acquaintance. Mrs% Smallridge, a most	308:382, 7D  !
5D	delightful woman|~ A style of living almost equal to	308:382, 8D  !
5D	Maple Grove~ and as to the children, except the little	308:382, 9D  !
5D	Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant	308:382,10D  !
5D	sweet children any where. Jane will be treated with such	308:382,11D  !
5D	regard and kindness|~ It will be nothing but pleasure,	308:382,12D  !
5D	a life of pleasure.~ And her salary|~ I really cannot venture	308:382,13D  !
5D	to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse. Even	308:382,14D  !
5D	you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe	308:382,15D  !
5D	that so much could be given to a young person like Jane."	308:382,16D  !
5A	"Ah| madam,"	308:382,17A  !
5A	"if other children are at	308:382,17A  !
5A	all like what I remember to have been myself, I should	308:382,18A  !
5A	think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard	308:382,19A  !
5A	named as a salary on such occasions, dearly earned."	308:382,20A  !
5D	"You are so noble in your ideas|"	308:382,21D  !
5A	"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"	308:382,22A  !
5D	"Very soon, very soon indeed; that's the worst of it.	308:382,23D  !
5D	Within a fortnight. Mrs% Smallridge is in a great hurry.	308:382,24D  !
5D	My poor mother does not know how to bear it. So then,	308:382,25D  !
5D	I try to put it out of her thoughts, and say, Come ma'am,	308:382,26D  !
5D	do not let us think about it any more."	308:382,27D  !
5A	"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not	308:382,28A  !
5A	Colonel and Mrs% Campbell be sorry to find that she has	308:382,29A  !
5A	engaged herself before their return?"	308:382,30A  !
5D	"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this	308:382,31D  !
5D	is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in	308:382,32D  !
5D	declining. I was so astonished when she first told me	308:382,33D  !
5D	what she had been saying to Mrs% Elton, and when	308:382,34D  !
5D	Mrs% Elton at the same moment came congratulating me	308:382,35D  !
5D	upon it| It was before tea~ stay~ no, it could not be	308:382,36D  !
5D	before tea, because we were just going to cards~ and yet	308:382,37D  !
5D	it was before tea, because I remember thinking~ Oh| no	308:382,38D  !
5D	now I recollect, now I have it; something happened	308:383, 1D  !
5D	before tea, but not that. Mr% Elton was called out of the	308:383, 2D  !
5D	room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak	308:383, 3D  !
5D	with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him;	308:383, 4D  !
5D	he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and	308:383, 5D  !
5D	now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with	308:383, 6D  !
5D	the rheumatic gout in his joints~ I must go and see him	308:383, 7D  !
5D	to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all.	308:383, 8D  !
5D	And poor John's son came to talk to Mr% Elton about relief	308:383, 9D  !
5D	from the parish: he is very well to do himself, you know,	308:383,10D  !
5D	being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of	308:383,11D  !
5D	that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some	308:383,12D  !
5D	help; so, when Mr% Elton came back, he told us what	308:383,13D  !
5D	John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out	308:383,14D  !
5D	about the chaise having been sent to Randall's to take	308:383,15D  !
5D	Mr% Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what	308:383,16D  !
5D	happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to	308:383,17D  !
5D	Mrs% Elton."	308:383,18D  !
5D	"Ay, I see what you are thinking of, the piano forte=.	308:384, 9D  !
5D	What is to become of that?~ Very true. Poor dear Jane	308:384,10D  !
5D	was talking of it just now.~	308:384,11D  !
5D	said she.	308:384,11D  !
5D	said she;	308:384,13D  !
5D	And to this day, I do believe, she knows not	308:384,16D  !
5D	whether it was his present or his daughter's."	308:384,17D  !
5B	"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have	309:385, 7B  !
5B	no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly.	309:385, 8B  !
5B	I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and	309:385, 9B  !
5B	Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the	309:385,10B  !
5B	""love,"" which nobody carries?"	309:385,11B  !
5A	"Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"	309:385,12A  !
5B	"Yes~ rather~ I have been thinking of it some little	309:385,13B  !
5B	time."	309:385,14B  !
5P	"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?~ And	309:385,20P  !
5P	how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?	309:385,21P  !
5P	~ I dare say they must have been very much obliged to	309:385,22P  !
5P	you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs% and	309:385,23P  !
5P	Miss Bates, Mr% Knightley, as I told you before. She is	309:385,24P  !
5P	always so attentive to them|"	309:385,25P  !
5P	"I am very glad indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so	309:387, 6P  !
5P	comfortably settled. Mrs% Elton is very good-natured and	309:387, 7P  !
5P	agreeable, and I dare say her acquaintance are just what	309:387, 8P  !
5P	they ought to be. I hope it is a dry situation, and that her	309:387, 9P  !
5P	health will be taken good care of. It ought to be a first	309:387,10P  !
5P	object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.	309:387,11P  !
5P	You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady	309:387,12P  !
5P	what Miss Taylor was to us. And I hope she will be better	309:387,13P  !
5P	off in one respect, and not be induced to go away after it	309:387,14P  !
5P	has been her home so long."	309:387,15P  !
5N	"Ah| poor woman, who would have thought	309:388, 7N  !
5N	it|"	309:388, 8N  !
5D	"Indeed, the	309:390,31D  !
5D	truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see	309:390,32D  !
5D	anybody~ anybody at all~ Mrs% Elton, indeed, could not	309:390,33D  !
5D	be denied~ and Mrs% Cole had made such a point~ and	309:390,34D  !
5D	Mrs% Perry had said so much~ but, except them, Jane	309:390,35D  !
5D	would really see nobody."	309:390,36D  !
5D	"dear Jane would not be satisfied	309:391,15D  !
5D	without its being sent back; it was a thing she could not	309:391,16D  !
5D	take~ and, moreover, she insisted on her saying, that she	309:391,17D  !
5D	was not at all in want of any thing."	309:391,18D  !
5N	"could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly	310:392, 3N  !
5N	to speak with her."~	310:392, 4N  !
5N	"Can you come to Randall's at any time this morning?	310:392, 7N  !
5N	~ Do, if it be possible. Mrs% Weston wants to see you.	310:392, 8N  !
5N	She must see you."	310:392, 9N  !
5A	"Is she unwell?"	310:392,10A  !
5N	"No, no, not at all~ only a little agitated. She would	310:392,11N  !
5N	have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must	310:392,12N  !
5N	see you \alone\, and that you know~	310:392,13N  !
5N	~ Humph|~ Can you come?"	310:392,14N  !
5A	"Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible	310:392,15A  !
5A	to refuse what you ask in such a way. But what can	310:392,16A  !
5A	be the matter?~ Is she really not ill?"	310:392,17A  !
5N	"Depend upon me~ but ask no more questions. You	310:392,18N  !
5N	will know it all in time. The most unaccountable business|	310:392,19N  !
5N	But hush, hush|"	310:392,20N  !
5A	"Now,"	310:392,28A  !
5A	"now Mr% Weston, do let me know	310:392,29A  !
5A	what has happened."	310:392,30A  !
5N	"No, no,"	310:392,31N  !
5N	"Don't ask me.	310:392,31N  !
5N	I promised my wife to leave it all to her. She will break	310:392,32N  !
5N	it to you better than I can. Do not be impatient, Emma;	310:393, 1N  !
5N	it will all come out too soon."	310:393, 2N  !
5A	"Break it to me,"	310:393, 3A  !
5A	"Good God|~ Mr% Weston, tell me at once.~	310:393, 4A  !
5A	Something has happened in Brunswick Square. I know	310:393, 5A  !
5A	it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what	310:393, 6A  !
5A	it is."	310:393, 7A  !
5N	"No, indeed you are mistaken."~	310:393, 8N  !
5A	"Mr% Weston do not trifle with me.~ Consider how	310:393, 9A  !
5A	many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square.	310:393,10A  !
5A	Which of them is it?~ I charge you by all that is sacred,	310:393,11A  !
5A	not to attempt concealment."	310:393,12A  !
5N	"Upon my word, Emma."~	310:393,13N  !
5A	"Your word|~ why not your honour|~ why not say	310:393,14A  !
5A	upon your honour, that it has nothing to do with any of	310:393,15A  !
5A	them? Good Heavens|~ What can be to be \broke\ to me,	310:393,16A  !
5A	that does not relate to one of that family?"	310:393,17A  !
5N	"Upon my honour,"	310:393,18N  !
5N	"it does	310:393,18N  !
5N	not. It is not in the smallest degree connected with any	310:393,19N  !
5N	human being of the name of Knightley."	310:393,20N  !
5N	"I was wrong,"	310:393,22N  !
5N	"in talking of its being	310:393,22N  !
5N	\broke\ to you. I should not have used the expression. In	310:393,23N  !
5N	fact, it does not concern you~ it concerns only myself,~	310:393,24N  !
5N	that is, we hope.~ Humph| ~ In short, my dear Emma,	310:393,25N  !
5N	there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don't say	310:393,26N  !
5N	that it is not a disagreeable business~ but things might	310:393,27N  !
5N	be much worse.~ If we walk fast, we shall soon be at	310:393,28N  !
5N	Randall's."	310:393,29N  !
5A	"Who is that gentleman on horseback?"	310:394, 3A  !
5N	"I do not know.~ One of the Otways.~ Not Frank;~	310:394, 6N  !
5N	it is not Frank, I assure you. You will not see him. He	310:394, 7N  !
5N	is half way to Windsor by this time."	310:394, 8N  !
5A	"Has your son been with you, then?"	310:394, 9A  !
5N	"Oh| yes~ did not you know?~ Well, well, never	310:394,10N  !
5N	mind."	310:394,11N  !
5N	"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us	310:394,14N  !
5N	how we did."	310:394,15N  !
5N	"Well, my dear,"	310:394,17N  !
5N	"I have brought her, and now I hope you will soon be	310:394,18N  !
5N	better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in	310:394,19N  !
5N	delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me."	310:394,20N  !
5N	"I have been as good as my word.	310:394,22N  !
5N	She has not the least idea."	310:394,23N  !
5A	"What is it my dear friend? Something of a very	310:394,27A  !
5A	unpleasant nature, I find, has occurred;~ do let me know	310:394,28A  !
5A	directly what it is. I have been walking all this way in	310:394,29A  !
5A	complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do not let	310:394,30A  !
5A	mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your	310:394,31A  !
5A	distress, whatever it may be."	310:394,32A  !
5O	"Have you indeed no idea?"	310:394,33O  !
5O	"Cannot you, my dear Emma~	310:394,34O  !
5O	cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?"	310:394,35O  !
5A	"So far as that it relates to Mr% Frank Churchill, I do	310:394,36A  !
5A	guess."	310:394,37A  !
5O	"You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell	310:394,38O  !
5O	you directly;"	310:395, 1O  !
5O	"He has been here this very morning,	310:395, 2O  !
5O	on a most extraordinary errand. It is impossible to	310:395, 3O  !
5O	express our surprise. He came to speak to his father on	310:395, 4O  !
5O	a subject,~ to announce an attachment~"	310:395, 5O  !
5O	"More than an attachment, indeed,"	310:395, 8O  !
5O	"an engagement~ a positive engagement.~	310:395, 9O  !
5O	What will you say, Emma~ what will anybody say, when	310:395,10O  !
5O	it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are	310:395,11O  !
5O	engaged;~ nay, that they have been long engaged|"	310:395,12O  !
5A	"Jane Fairfax|~ Good God| You are not serious?	310:395,15A  !
5A	You do not mean it?"	310:395,16A  !
5O	"You may well be amazed,"	310:395,17O  !
5O	"You may well be	310:395,19O  !
5O	amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn	310:395,20O  !
5O	engagement between them ever since October~ formed	310:395,21O  !
5O	at Weymouth, and kept a secret from everybody. Not	310:395,22O  !
5O	a creature knowing it but themselves~ neither the Campbells,	310:395,23O  !
5O	nor her family, nor his.~ It is so wonderful, that	310:395,24O  !
5O	though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost	310:395,25O  !
5O	incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.~ I thought	310:395,26O  !
5O	I knew him."	310:395,27O  !
5A	"Well,"	310:395,33A  !
5A	"this	310:395,33A  !
5A	is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day,	310:395,34A  !
5A	before I can at all comprehend it. What|~ engaged	310:395,35A  !
5A	to her all the winter~ before either of them came to	310:395,36A  !
5A	Highbury?"	310:395,37A  !
5O	"Engaged since October,~ secretly engaged.~ It has	310:395,38O  !
5O	hurt me, Emma, very much. It has hurt his father	310:396, 1O  !
5O	equally. \Some\ \part\ of his conduct we cannot excuse."	310:396, 2O  !
5A	"I will	310:396, 3A  !
5A	not pretend \not\ to understand you; and to give you all	310:396, 4A  !
5A	the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has	310:396, 5A  !
5A	followed his attentions to me, as you are apprehensive	310:396, 6A  !
5A	of."	310:396, 7A  !
5A	"That you may have less difficulty in believing this	310:396,10A  !
5A	boast, of my present perfect indifference,"	310:396,11A  !
5A	"I will farther tell you, that there was a period in the	310:396,12A  !
5A	early part of our acquaintance, when I did like him, when	310:396,13A  !
5A	I was very much disposed to be attached to him~ nay,	310:396,14A  !
5A	was attached~ and how it came to cease, is perhaps the	310:396,15A  !
5A	wonder. Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really	310:396,16A  !
5A	for some time past, for at least these three months, cared	310:396,17A  !
5A	nothing about him. You may believe me, Mrs% Weston.	310:396,18A  !
5A	This is the simple truth."	310:396,19A  !
5O	"Mr% Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,"	310:396,24O  !
5O	"On this point we have been wretched. It was	310:396,25O  !
5O	our darling wish that you might be attached to each	310:396,26O  !
5O	other~ and we were persuaded that it was so.~ Imagine	310:396,27O  !
5O	what we have been feeling on your account."	310:396,28O  !
5A	"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be	310:396,29A  !
5A	a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself. But this	310:396,30A  !
5A	does not acquit \him\, Mrs% Weston; and I must say, that	310:396,31A  !
5A	I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to come	310:396,32A  !
5A	among us with affection and faith engaged, and with	310:396,33A  !
5A	manners so \very\ disengaged? What right had he to	310:396,34A  !
5A	endeavour to please, as he certainly did~ to distinguish	310:396,35A  !
5A	any one young woman with persevering attention, as he	310:396,36A  !
5A	certainly did~ while he really belonged to another?~	310:396,37A  !
5A	How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?~How	310:396,38A  !
5A	could he tell that he might not be making me in love with	310:397, 1A  !
5A	him?~ very wrong, very wrong indeed."	310:397, 2A  !
5O	"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather	310:397, 3O  !
5O	imagine~"	310:397, 4O  !
5A	"And how could \she\ bear such behaviour| Composure	310:397, 5A  !
5A	with a witness| to look on, while repeated attentions	310:397, 6A  !
5A	were offering to another woman, before her face, and not	310:397, 7A  !
5A	resent it.~ That is a degree of placidity, which I can	310:397, 8A  !
5A	neither comprehend nor respect."	310:397, 9A  !
5O	"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma;	310:397,10O  !
5O	he said so expressly. He had not time to enter into much	310:397,11O  !
5O	explanation. He was here only a quarter of an hour, and	310:397,12O  !
5O	in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even	310:397,13O  !
5O	of the time he could stay~ but that there had been misunderstandings	310:397,14O  !
5O	he decidedly said. The present crisis,	310:397,15O  !
5O	indeed, seemed to be brought on by them; and those	310:397,16O  !
5O	misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the	310:397,17O  !
5O	impropriety of his conduct."	310:397,18O  !
5A	"Impropriety| Oh| Mrs% Weston~ it is too calm	310:397,19A  !
5A	a censure. Much, much beyond impropriety|~ It has	310:397,20A  !
5A	sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion.	310:397,21A  !
5A	So unlike what a man should be|~ None of that upright	310:397,22A  !
5A	integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle,	310:397,23A  !
5A	that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man should	310:397,24A  !
5A	display in every transaction of his life."	310:397,25A  !
5O	"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for	310:397,26O  !
5O	though he has been wrong in this instance, I have known	310:397,27O  !
5O	him long enough to answer for his having many, very	310:397,28O  !
5O	many, good qualities; and~"	310:397,29O  !
5A	"Good God|"	310:397,30A  !
5A	"Mrs% Smallridge, too| Jane actually on the point of	310:397,31A  !
5A	going as governess| What could he mean by such horrible	310:397,32A  !
5A	indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself~ to suffer her	310:397,33A  !
5A	even to think of such a measure|"	310:397,34A  !
5O	"He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article	310:397,35O  !
5O	I can fully acquit him. It was a private resolution of her's,	310:397,36O  !
5O	not communicated to him~ or at least not communicated	310:397,37O  !
5O	in a way to carry conviction.~ Till yesterday, I know he	310:397,38O  !
5O	said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on	310:398, 1O  !
5O	him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message~	310:398, 2O  !
5O	and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this	310:398, 3O  !
5O	very project of her's, which determined him to come	310:398, 4O  !
5O	forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on	310:398, 5O  !
5O	his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable	310:398, 6O  !
5O	state of concealment that had been carrying on so long."	310:398, 7O  !
5O	"I am to hear from him soon,"	310:398, 9O  !
5O	"He told me at parting, that he should soon write; and	310:398,10O  !
5O	he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many	310:398,11O  !
5O	particulars that could not be given now. Let us wait,	310:398,12O  !
5O	therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations.	310:398,13O  !
5O	It may make many things intelligible and excusable which	310:398,14O  !
5O	now are not to be understood. Don't let us be severe,	310:398,15O  !
5O	don't let us be in a hurry to condemn him. Let us have	310:398,16O  !
5O	patience. I must love him; and now that I am satisfied	310:398,17O  !
5O	on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely	310:398,18O  !
5O	anxious for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that	310:398,19O  !
5O	it may. They must both have suffered a great deal under	310:398,20O  !
5O	such a system of secresy and concealment."	310:398,21O  !
5A	"\His\ sufferings,"	310:398,22A  !
5A	"do not appear	310:398,22A  !
5A	to have done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr% Churchill	310:398,23A  !
5A	take it?"	310:398,24A  !
5O	"Most favourably for his nephew~ gave his consent	310:398,25O  !
5O	with scarcely a difficulty. Conceive what the events of	310:398,26O  !
5O	a week have done in that family| While poor Mrs% Churchill	310:398,27O  !
5O	lived, I suppose there could not have been	310:398,28O  !
5O	a hope, a chance, a possibility;~ but scarcely are her	310:398,29O  !
5O	remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is	310:398,30O  !
5O	persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have	310:398,31O  !
5O	required. What a blessing it is, when undue influence	310:398,32O  !
5O	does not survive the grave|~ He gave his consent with	310:398,33O  !
5O	very little persuasion."	310:398,34O  !
5O	"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the	310:398,37O  !
5O	light this morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the	310:398,38O  !
5O	Bates's, I fancy, some time~ and then came on hither;	310:399, 1O  !
5O	but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to whom	310:399, 2O  !
5O	he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,	310:399, 3O  !
5O	he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.~ He was	310:399, 4O  !
5O	very much agitated~ very much, indeed~ to a degree	310:399, 5O  !
5O	that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing	310:399, 6O  !
5O	I had ever seen him before.~ In addition to all the rest,	310:399, 7O  !
5O	there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell,	310:399, 8O  !
5O	which he had had no previous suspicion of~ and there was	310:399, 9O  !
5O	every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."	310:399,10O  !
5A	"And do you really believe the affair to have been	310:399,11A  !
5A	carrying on with such perfect secresy?~ The Campbells,	310:399,12A  !
5A	the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?"	310:399,13A  !
5O	"None; not one. He positively said that it had been	310:399,16O  !
5O	known to no being in the world but their two selves."	310:399,17O  !
5A	"Well,"	310:399,18A  !
5A	"I suppose we shall gradually	310:399,18A  !
5A	grow reconciled to the idea, and I wish them very happy.	310:399,19A  !
5A	But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of	310:399,20A  !
5A	proceeding. What has it been but a system of hypocrisy	310:399,21A  !
5A	and deceit,~ espionage, and treachery?~ To come among	310:399,22A  !
5A	us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such	310:399,23A  !
5A	a league in secret to judge us all|~ Here have we been, the	310:399,24A  !
5A	whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying	310:399,25A  !
5A	ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with	310:399,26A  !
5A	two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying	310:399,27A  !
5A	round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments	310:399,28A  !
5A	and words that were never meant for both to hear.~ They	310:399,29A  !
5A	must take the consequence, if they have heard each other	310:399,30A  !
5A	spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable|"	310:399,31A  !
5O	"I am quite easy on that head,"	310:399,32O  !
5O	"I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to	310:399,33O  !
5O	the other, which both might not have heard."	310:399,34O  !
5A	"You are in luck.~ Your only blunder was confined to	310:399,35A  !
5A	my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of our's in love	310:399,36A  !
5A	with the lady."	310:399,37A  !
5O	"True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good	310:399,38O  !
5O	opinion of Miss Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder,	310:400, 1O  !
5O	have spoken ill of her; and as to speaking ill of him,	310:400, 2O  !
5O	there I have been safe."	310:400, 3O  !
5O	"Now, dearest Emma, let me	310:400, 7O  !
5O	intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his	310:400, 8O  !
5O	heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the	310:400, 9O  !
5O	match. Let us make the best of it~ and, indeed, almost	310:400,10O  !
5O	every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It is not	310:400,11O  !
5O	a connexion to gratify; but if Mr% Churchill does not feel	310:400,12O  !
5O	that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate	310:400,13O  !
5O	circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean, that he should	310:400,14O  !

5O	character and good judgment as I have always given her	310:400,16O  !
5O	credit for~ and still am disposed to give her credit for, in	310:400,17O  !
5O	spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of	310:400,18O  !
5O	right. And how much may be said in her situation for	310:400,19O  !
5O	even that error|"	310:400,20O  !
5A	"Much indeed|"	310:400,21A  !
5A	"If a	310:400,21A  !
5A	woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is	310:400,22A  !
5A	in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.~ Of such, one may almost	310:400,23A  !
5A	say, that ""the world is not their's, nor the world's law."" "	310:400,24A  !
5A	"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon	310:400,27A  !
5A	my word| This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my	310:400,28A  !
5A	curiosity, and exercise my talent of guessing. But you	310:400,29A  !
5A	really frightened me. I thought you had lost half your	310:400,30A  !
5A	property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter	310:400,31A  !
5A	of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.~	310:400,32A  !
5A	I congratulate you, Mr% Weston, with all my heart, on the	310:400,33A  !
5A	prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished	310:400,34A  !
5A	young women in England for your daughter."	310:400,35A  !
5B	"Emma, you	311:402,11B  !
5B	have been no friend to Harriet Smith."	311:402,12B  !
5A	"But, with common sense,"	311:402,30A  !
5A	"I am	311:402,30A  !
5A	afraid I have had little to do."	311:402,31A  !
5N	"For the present, the whole affair was to be completely	311:403,30N  !
5N	a secret. Mr% Churchill had made a point of it, as a token	311:403,31N  !
5N	of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and	311:403,32N  !
5N	everybody admitted it to be no more than due decorum."~	311:403,33N  !
5M	"Well, Miss Woodhouse|"	311:404, 9M  !
5M	"is not this the oddest news that	311:404,10M  !
5M	ever was?"	311:404,11M  !
5A	"What news do you mean?"	311:404,12A  !
5M	"About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing	311:404,15M  !
5M	so strange? Oh|~ you need not be afraid of owning it	311:404,16M  !
5M	to me, for Mr% Weston has told me himself. I met him	311:404,17M  !
5M	just now. He told me it was to be a great secret; and,	311:404,18M  !
5M	therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body	311:404,19M  !
5M	but you, but he said you knew it."	311:404,20M  !
5A	"What did Mr% Weston tell you?"~	311:404,21A  !
5M	"Oh| he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and	311:404,23M  !
5M	Mr% Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have	311:404,24M  !
5M	been privately engaged to one another this long while.	311:404,25M  !
5M	How very odd|"	311:404,26M  !
5M	"Had you any idea,"	311:404,33M  !
5M	"of his being in	311:404,33M  !
5M	love with her?~ You, perhaps, might.~ You	311:404,34M  !
5M	who can see into everybody's heart; but	311:404,35M  !
5M	nobody else~"	311:404,36M  !
5A	"Upon my word,"	311:404,37A  !
5A	"I begin to doubt my	311:404,37A  !
5A	having any such talent. Can you seriously ask me, Harriet,	311:404,38A  !
5A	whether I imagined him attached to another woman at	311:405, 1A  !
5A	the very time that I was~ tacitly, if not openly~ encouraging	311:405, 2A  !
5A	you to give way to your own feelings?~ I never	311:405, 3A  !
5A	had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of	311:405, 4A  !
5A	Mr% Frank Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.	311:405, 5A  !
5A	You may be very sure that if I had, I should	311:405, 6A  !
5A	have cautioned you accordingly."	311:405, 7A  !
5M	"Me|"	311:405, 8M  !
5M	"Why should you caution me?~ You do not think I care	311:405, 9M  !
5M	about Mr% Frank Churchill."	311:405,10M  !
5A	"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the	311:405,11A  !
5A	subject,"	311:405,12A  !
5A	"but you do not mean	311:405,12A  !
5A	to deny that there was a time~ and not very distant either	311:405,13A  !
5A	~ when you gave me reason to understand that you did	311:405,14A  !
5A	care about him?"	311:405,15A  !
5M	"Him|~ never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how	311:405,16M  !
5M	could you so mistake me?"	311:405,17M  !
5A	"Harriet|"	311:405,18A  !
5A	"What do you mean?~ Good Heaven| what do you	311:405,19A  !
5A	mean?~ Mistake you|~ Am I to suppose then?~"	311:405,20A  !
5M	"I should not have thought it possible,"	311:405,28M  !
5M	"that you could have misunderstood me| I know we	311:405,29M  !
5M	agreed never to name him~ but considering how infinitely	311:405,30M  !
5M	superior he is to every body else, I should not have	311:405,31M  !
5M	thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any	311:405,32M  !
5M	other person. Mr% Frank Churchill, indeed| I do not	311:405,33M  !
5M	know who would ever look at him in the company of the	311:405,34M  !
5M	other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of	311:405,35M  !
5M	Mr% Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And	311:405,36M  !
5M	that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing|~ I am	311:405,37M  !
5M	sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and	311:405,38M  !
5M	meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have	311:406, 1M  !
5M	considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to	311:406, 2M  !
5M	dare to think of him. At first, if you had not told me that	311:406, 3M  !
5M	more wonderful things had happened; that there had	311:406, 4M  !
5M	been matches of greater disparity (those were your very	311:406, 5M  !
5M	words);~ I should not have dared to give way to~	311:406, 6M  !
5M	I should not have thought it possible~ But if \you\, who	311:406, 7M  !
5M	had been always acquainted with him~"	311:406, 8M  !
5A	"Harriet|"	311:406, 9A  !
5A	"Let us understand each other now, without the possibility	311:406,10A  !
5A	of farther mistake. Are you speaking of ~ Mr% Knightley?"	311:406,11A  !
5M	"To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body	311:406,13M  !
5M	else~ and so I thought you knew. When we talked	311:406,14M  !
5M	about him, it was clear as possible."	311:406,15M  !
5A	"Not quite,"	311:406,16A  !
5A	"for all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to	311:406,17A  !
5A	a different person. I could almost assert that you had	311:406,18A  !
5A	\named\ Mr% Frank Churchill. I am sure the service	311:406,19A  !
5A	Mr% Frank Churchill rendered you, in protecting you	311:406,20A  !
5A	from the gipsies, was spoken of."	311:406,21A  !
5M	"Oh| Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget|"	311:406,22M  !
5A	"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance	311:406,23A  !
5A	of what I said on the occasion. I told you that I did not	311:406,24A  !
5A	wonder at your attachment; that considering the service	311:406,25A  !
5A	he had rendered you, it was extremely natural:~ and you	311:406,26A  !
5A	agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your	311:406,27A  !
5A	sense of that service, and mentioning even what your	311:406,28A  !
5A	sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your	311:406,29A  !
5A	rescue.~ The impression of it is strong on my memory."	311:406,30A  !
5M	"Oh, dear,"	311:406,31M  !
5M	"now I recollect what you	311:406,31M  !
5M	mean; but I was thinking of something very different at	311:406,32M  !
5M	the time. It was not the gipsies~ it was not Mr% Frank Churchill	311:406,33M  !
5M	that I meant. No|	311:406,34M  !
5M	I was	311:406,34M  !
5M	thinking of a much more precious circumstance~ of	311:406,35M  !
5M	Mr% Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when	311:406,36M  !
5M	Mr% Elton would not stand up with me; and when there	311:406,37M  !
5M	was no other partner in the room. That was the kind	311:406,38M  !
5M	action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity;	311:407, 1M  !
5M	that was the service which made me begin to feel how	311:407, 2M  !
5M	superior he was to every other being upon earth."	311:407, 3M  !
5A	"Good God|"	311:407, 4A  !
5A	"this has been a most	311:407, 4A  !
5A	unfortunate~ most deplorable mistake|~ What is to be	311:407, 5A  !
5A	done?"	311:407, 6A  !
5M	"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had	311:407, 7M  !
5M	understood me. At least, however, I cannot be worse off	311:407, 8M  !
5M	than I should have been, if the other had been the person;	311:407, 9M  !
5M	and now~ it \is\ possible~."	311:407,10M  !
5M	"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,"	311:407,12M  !
5M	"that you should feel a great difference between the two,	311:407,13M  !
5M	as to me or as to anybody. You must think one five	311:407,14M  !
5M	hundred million times more above me than the other.	311:407,15M  !
5M	But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing~ that if~	311:407,16M  !
5M	strange as it may appear~. But you know they were	311:407,17M  !
5M	your own words, that \more\ wonderful things had happened,	311:407,18M  !
5M	matches of \greater\ disparity had taken place than between	311:407,19M  !
5M	Mr% Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as	311:407,20M  !
5M	if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before~	311:407,21M  !
5M	and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to~	311:407,22M  !
5M	if Mr% Knightley should really~ if \he\ does not mind the	311:407,23M  !
5M	disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set	311:407,24M  !
5M	yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way.	311:407,25M  !
5M	But you are too good for that, I am sure."	311:407,26M  !
5A	"Have you any idea of Mr% Knightley's returning your	311:407,30A  !
5A	affection?"	311:407,31A  !
5M	"Yes,"	311:407,32M  !
5M	"I must say that I have."	311:407,33M  !
5A	"Might he not?~ Is it not possible, that when enquiring,	311:410,33A  !
5A	as you thought, into the state of your affections, he might	311:410,34A  !
5A	be alluding to Mr% Martin~ he might have Mr% Martin's	311:410,35A  !
5A	interest in view?"	311:410,36A  !
5M	"Mr% Martin| No indeed|~ There was not a hint of	311:410,38M  !
5M	Mr% Martin. I hope I know better now, than to care for	311:411, 1M  !
5M	Mr% Martin, or to be suspected of it."	311:411, 2M  !
5M	"I never should have presumed to think of it at first,"	311:411, 6M  !
5M	"but for you. You told me to observe him	311:411, 7M  !
5M	carefully, and let his behaviour be the rule of mine~ and	311:411, 8M  !
5M	so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him;	311:411, 9M  !
5M	and that if he does choose me, it will not be any thing	311:411,10M  !
5M	so very wonderful."	311:411,11M  !
5A	"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr% Knightley	311:411,15A  !
5A	is the last man in the world, who would intentionally	311:411,16A  !
5A	give any woman the idea of his feeling for her	311:411,17A  !
5A	more than he really does."	311:411,18A  !
5M	"She could not compose	311:411,24M  !
5M	herself~ Mr% Woodhouse would be alarmed~ she had	311:411,25M  !
5M	better go;"~	311:411,26M  !
5A	"Oh God| that I had never	311:411,29A  !
5A	seen her|"	311:411,30A  !
5N	"such things,"	312:417,36N  !
5N	"always got about."	312:417,37N  !
5O	"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the	312:418,29O  !
5O	concealment of so many months,"	312:418,30O  !
5O	"she was energetic. This was one of her expressions.	312:418,31O  !
5O	and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an	312:418,35O  !
5O	attestation that I felt at my heart."	312:418,36O  !
5A	"Poor girl|"	312:418,37A  !
5A	"She thinks herself wrong,	312:418,37A  !
5A	then, for having consented to a private engagement?"	312:418,38A  !
5O	"Wrong|~ No one, I believe, can blame her more than	312:419, 1O  !
5O	she is disposed to blame herself.	312:419, 2O  !
5O	said	312:419, 2O  !
5O	she,	312:419, 3O  !
5O	she continued,	312:419,10O  !
5A	"Poor girl|"	312:419,17A  !
5A	"She loves him then	312:419,17A  !
5A	excessively, I suppose. It must have been from attachment	312:419,18A  !
5A	only, that she could be led to form the engagement.	312:419,19A  !
5A	Her affection must have overpowered her judgment."	312:419,20A  !
5O	"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached	312:419,21O  !
5O	to him."	312:419,22O  !
5A	"I am afraid,"	312:419,23A  !
5A	"that I must	312:419,23A  !
5A	often have contributed to make her unhappy."	312:419,24A  !
5O	"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.	312:419,25O  !
5O	But she probably had something of that in her thoughts,	312:419,26O  !
5O	when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had	312:419,27O  !
5O	given us hints of before.	312:419,28O  !
5O	she said,	312:419,29O  !
5O	said she,	312:419,34O  !
5O	She	312:419,38O  !
5O	then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness	312:420, 1O  !
5O	you had shown her during her illness; and with a blush	312:420, 2O  !
5O	which showed me how it was all connected,	312:420, 3O  !
5O	She was sensible that you had never	312:420, 6O  !
5O	received any proper acknowledgment from herself."	312:420, 7O  !
5A	"If I did not know her to be happy now,"	312:420, 8A  !
5A	"which, in spite of every little drawback from	312:420, 9A  !
5A	her scrupulous conscience, she must be, I could not bear	312:420,10A  !
5A	these thanks; ~ for, oh| Mrs% Weston, if there were an	312:420,11A  !
5A	account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done	312:420,12A  !
5A	Miss Fairfax|~ Well,	312:420,13A  !
5A	this is all to be forgotten. You are very	312:420,14A  !
5A	kind to bring me these interesting particulars. They show	312:420,15A  !
5A	her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is very good~	312:420,16A  !
5A	I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune	312:420,17A  !
5A	should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on	312:420,18A  !
5A	her's."	312:420,19A  !

5A	"You have some news to hear, now you are come back,	313:425,11A  !
5A	that will rather surprise you."	313:425,12A  !
5B	"Have I?"	313:425,13B  !
5B	"of	313:425,13B  !
5B	what nature?"	313:425,14B  !
5A	"Oh| the best nature in the world~ a wedding."	313:425,15A  !
5B	"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have	313:425,18B  !
5B	heard that already."	313:425,19B  !
5A	"How is it possible?"	313:425,20A  !
5B	"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr% Weston	313:425,24B  !
5B	this morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief	313:425,25B  !
5B	account of what had happened."	313:425,26B  !
5A	"\You\ probably have been less surprised than any of us,	313:425,29A  !
5A	for you have had your suspicions.~ I have not forgotten	313:425,30A  !
5A	that you once tried to give me a caution.~ I wish I had	313:425,31A  !
5A	attended to it~ but~	313:425,32A  !
5A	I seem to have been doomed to blindness."	313:425,33A  !

5A	"You are very kind~ but you are mistaken~ and	313:426,13A  !
5A	I must set you right.~ I am not in want of that sort of	313:426,14A  !
5A	compassion. My blindness to what was going on, led me	313:426,15A  !
5A	to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed	313:426,16A  !
5A	of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many	313:426,17A  !
5A	things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures,	313:426,18A  !
5A	but I have no other reason to regret that I was	313:426,19A  !

5B	the degree of what you felt~ I could only be certain that	313:426,29B  !
5B	there was a preference~ and a preference which I never	313:426,30B  !
5B	believed him to deserve.~ He is a disgrace to the name	313:426,31B  !
5B	of man.~ And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young	313:426,32B  !
5B	woman?~ Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature."	313:426,33B  !
5A	"Mr% Knightley,"	313:426,34A  !
5A	"I am in a very extraordinary situation.	313:426,35A  !
5A	I cannot let you continue in your error; and yet, perhaps,	313:426,36A  !
5A	since my manners gave such an impression, I have as	313:426,37A  !
5A	much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never	313:426,38A  !
5A	have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of,	313:427, 1A  !
5A	as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing	313:427, 2A  !
5A	exactly the reverse.~ But I never have."	313:427, 3A  !
5A	"I have very little to say for my own conduct.~ I was	313:427, 9A  !
5A	tempted by his attentions, and allowed myself to appear	313:427,10A  !
5A	pleased.~ An old story, probably~ a common case~ and	313:427,11A  !
5A	no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before;	313:427,12A  !
5A	and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets	313:427,13A  !
5A	up as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted	313:427,14A  !
5A	the temptation. He was the son of Mr% Weston~ he was	313:427,15A  !
5A	continually here~ I always found him very pleasant~ and,	313:427,16A  !
5A	in short, for	313:427,17A  !
5A	let me swell out the causes ever	313:427,17A  !
5A	so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last~ my vanity	313:427,18A  !
5A	was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly,	313:427,19A  !
5A	however~ for some time, indeed~ I have had no idea of	313:427,20A  !
5A	their meaning any thing.~ I thought them a habit,	313:427,21A  !
5A	a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.	313:427,22A  !
5A	He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have	313:427,23A  !
5A	never been attached to him. And now I can tolerably	313:427,24A  !
5A	comprehend his behaviour. He never wished to attach	313:427,25A  !
5A	me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation	313:427,26A  !
5A	with another.~ It was his object to blind all about him;	313:427,27A  !
5A	and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded	313:427,28A  !
5A	than myself~ except that I was \not\ blinded~ that it was	313:427,29A  !
5A	my good fortune~ that, in short, I was somehow or other	313:427,30A  !
5A	safe from him."	313:427,31A  !
5B	"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.~	313:427,36B  !
5B	I can suppose, however, that I may have under-rated him.	313:427,37B  !
5B	My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.~ And	313:427,38B  !
5B	even if I have not under-rated him hitherto, he may yet	313:428, 1B  !
5B	turn out well.~ With such a woman he has a chance.~	313:428, 2B  !
5B	I have no motive for wishing him ill~ and for her sake,	313:428, 3B  !
5B	whose happiness will be involved in his good character and	313:428, 4B  !
5B	conduct, I shall certainly wish him well."	313:428, 5B  !
5A	"I have no doubt of their being happy together,"	313:428, 6A  !
5A	"I believe them to be very mutually and very	313:428, 7A  !
5A	sincerely attached."	313:428, 8A  !
5B	"He is a most fortunate man|"	313:428, 9B  !
5B	"So early in life~ at three and twenty~ a	313:428,10B  !
5B	period when, if a man chooses a wife, he generally chooses	313:428,11B  !
5B	ill. At three and twenty to have drawn such a prize|~	313:428,12B  !
5B	What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,	313:428,13B  !
5B	has before him|~ Assured of the love of such a woman~	313:428,14B  !
5B	the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches	313:428,15B  !
5B	for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,~	313:428,16B  !
5B	equality of situation~ I mean, as far as regards society,	313:428,17B  !
5B	and all the habits and manners that are important;	313:428,18B  !
5B	equality in every point but one~ and that one, since the	313:428,19B  !
5B	purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such as must	313:428,20B  !
5B	increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the only	313:428,21B  !
5B	advantages she wants.~ A man would always wish to give	313:428,22B  !
5B	a woman a better home than the one he takes her from;	313:428,23B  !
5B	and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of \her\ regard,	313:428,24B  !
5B	must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.~ Frank Churchill	313:428,25B  !
5B	is, indeed, the favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out	313:428,26B  !
5B	for his good.~ He meets with a young woman at a watering-place,	313:428,27B  !
5B	gains her affection, cannot even weary her by	313:428,28B  !
5B	negligent treatment~ and had he and all his family sought	313:428,29B  !
5B	round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not	313:428,30B  !
5B	have found her superior.~ His aunt is in the way.~ His	313:428,31B  !
5B	aunt dies.~ He has only to speak.~ His friends are eager	313:428,32B  !
5B	to promote his happiness.~ He has used every body ill~	313:428,33B  !
5B	and they are all delighted to forgive him.~ He is a fortunate	313:428,34B  !
5B	man indeed|"	313:428,35B  !
5A	"You speak as if you envied him."	313:428,36A  !
5B	"And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the	313:428,37B  !
5B	object of my envy."	313:428,38B  !
5B	"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.~	313:429, 7B  !
5B	You are determined, I see, to have no curiosity.~ You are	313:429, 8B  !
5B	wise~ but \I\ cannot be wise. Emma, I must tell what you	313:429, 9B  !
5B	will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment."	313:429,10B  !
5A	"Oh| then, don't speak it, don't speak it,"	313:429,11A  !
5A	"Take a little time, consider, do not commit	313:429,12A  !
5A	yourself."	313:429,13A  !
5B	"Thank you,"	313:429,14B  !
5B	"You are going in, I suppose,"	313:429,24B  !
5A	"No"~	313:429,25A  !
5A	"I should like	313:429,26A  !
5A	to take another turn. Mr% Perry is not gone."	313:429,27A  !
5A	"I stopped you ungraciously,	313:429,28A  !
5A	just now, Mr% Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave	313:429,29A  !
5A	you pain.~ But if you have any wish to speak openly to	313:429,30A  !
5A	me as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you	313:429,31A  !
5A	may have in contemplation~ as a friend, indeed, you may	313:429,32A  !

5B	that I fear is a word~ No, I have no wish~ Stay, yes, why	313:429,36B  !
5B	should I hesitate?~ I have gone too far already for concealment.~	313:429,37B  !
5B	Emma, I accept your offer~ Extraordinary	313:429,38B  !
5B	as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as	313:430, 1B  !
5B	a friend.~ Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?"	313:430, 2B  !
5B	"My dearest Emma,"	313:430, 6B  !
5B	"for dearest you will	313:430, 6B  !
5B	always be, whatever the event of this hour's conversation,	313:430, 7B  !
5B	my dearest, most beloved Emma~ tell me at once. Say	313:430, 8B  !
5B	""No,"" if it is to be said."~	313:430, 9B  !

5B	less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know	313:430,18B  !
5B	what I am.~ You hear nothing but truth from me.~	313:430,19B  !
5B	I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne	313:430,20B  !
5B	it as no other woman in England would have borne it.~	313:430,21B  !
5B	Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma,	313:430,22B  !
5B	as well as you have borne with them. The manner,	313:430,23B  !
5B	perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God	313:430,24B  !
5B	knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.~ But you	313:430,25B  !
5B	understand me.~ Yes, you see, you understand my	313:430,26B  !
5B	feelings~ and will return them if you can. At present,	313:430,27B  !
5B	I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice."	313:430,28B  !
5O	"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in	314:436,15O  !
5O	forwarding to you the enclosed. I know what thorough	314:436,16O  !
5O	justice you will do it, and have scarcely a doubt of its	314:436,17O  !
5O	happy effect.~ I think we shall never materially disagree	314:436,18O  !
5O	about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long	314:436,19O  !
5O	preface.~ We are quite well.~ This letter has been the	314:436,20O  !
5O	cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.	314:436,21O  !
5O	~ I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday, but it was	314:436,22O  !
5O	an ungenial morning; and though you will never own	314:436,23O  !
5O	being affected by weather, I think every body feels	314:436,24O  !
5O	a north-east wind.~ I felt for your dear father very much	314:436,25O  !
5O	in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning,	314:436,26O  !
5O	but had the comfort of hearing last night, by Mr% Perry,	314:436,27O  !
5O	that it had not made him ill.	314:436,28O  !

5O	"A% W%"	314:436,30O  !
5E	Windsor-July.	314:436,32E  !
5E	MY DEAR MADAM,	314:436,33E  !
5E	"If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will	314:436,34E  !
5E	be expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read	314:436,35E  !
5E	with candour and indulgence.~ You are all goodness, and	314:436,36E  !
5E	I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to	314:436,37E  !
5E	allow for some parts of my past conduct.~ But I have been	314:436,38E  !
5E	forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage	314:437, 1E  !
5E	rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous	314:437, 2E  !
5E	to be humble. I have already met with such success in	314:437, 3E  !
5E	two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of	314:437, 4E  !
5E	thinking myself too sure of your's, and of those among	314:437, 5E  !
5E	your friends who have had any ground of offence.~ You	314:437, 6E  !
5E	must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of	314:437, 7E  !
5E	my situation when I first arrived at Randall's; you must	314:437, 8E  !
5E	consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all	314:437, 9E  !
5E	hazards. This was the fact. My right to place myself in	314:437,10E  !
5E	a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.	314:437,11E  !
5E	I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to \think\	314:437,12E  !
5E	it a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed	314:437,13E  !
5E	windows below, and casements above, in Highbury.	314:437,14E  !
5E	I dared not address her openly; my difficulties in the	314:437,15E  !
5E	then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require	314:437,16E  !
5E	definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before	314:437,17E  !
5E	we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright	314:437,18E  !
5E	female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret	314:437,19E  !
5E	engagement.~ Had she refused, I should have gone mad.	314:437,20E  !
5E	~ But you will be ready to say, what was your hope in	314:437,21E  !
5E	doing this?~ What did you look forward to?~ To any thing,	314:437,22E  !
5E	every thing~ to time, chance, circumstance, slow	314:437,23E  !
5E	effects, sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health	314:437,24E  !
5E	and sickness. Every possibility of good was before me,	314:437,25E  !
5E	and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her promises	314:437,26E  !
5E	of faith and correspondence. If you need farther explanation,	314:437,27E  !
5E	I have the honour, my dear madam, of being	314:437,28E  !
5E	your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition	314:437,29E  !
5E	to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses	314:437,30E  !
5E	or lands can ever equal the value of.~ See me, then,	314:437,31E  !
5E	under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to	314:437,32E  !
5E	Randall's;~ and here I am conscious of wrong, for that	314:437,33E  !
5E	visit might have been sooner paid. You will look back	314:437,34E  !
5E	and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in	314:437,35E  !
5E	Highbury; and as \you\ were the person slighted, you will	314:437,36E  !
5E	forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's	314:437,37E  !
5E	compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented	314:437,38E  !
5E	myself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing	314:438, 1E  !
5E	you. My behaviour, during the very happy fortnight	314:438, 2E  !
5E	which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to	314:438, 3E  !
5E	reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I come	314:438, 4E  !
5E	to the principal, the only important part of my conduct	314:438, 5E  !
5E	while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety,	314:438, 6E  !
5E	or requires very solicitous explanation. With the greatest	314:438, 7E  !
5E	respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse;	314:438, 8E  !
5E	my father perhaps will think I ought to	314:438, 9E  !
5E	add, with the deepest humiliation.~ A few words which	314:438,10E  !
5E	dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some	314:438,11E  !
5E	censure I acknowledge myself liable to.~ My behaviour	314:438,12E  !
5E	to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it	314:438,13E  !
5E	ought.~ In order to assist a concealment so essential to me,	314:438,14E  !
5E	I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the	314:438,15E  !
5E	sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.	314:438,16E  !
5E	~ I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible	314:438,17E  !
5E	object~ but I am sure you will believe the declaration,	314:438,18E  !
5E	that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would	314:438,19E  !
5E	not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.~	314:438,20E  !
5E	Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never	314:438,21E  !
5E	gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached;	314:438,22E  !
5E	and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to	314:438,23E  !
5E	being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my	314:438,24E  !
5E	wish.~ She received my attentions with an easy, friendly,	314:438,25E  !
5E	goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me. We	314:438,26E  !
5E	seemed to understand each other. From our relative	314:438,27E  !
5E	situation, those attentions were her due, and were felt to	314:438,28E  !
5E	be so.~ Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand	314:438,29E  !
5E	me before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot	314:438,30E  !
5E	say;~ when I called to take leave of her, I remember that	314:438,31E  !
5E	I was within a moment of confessing the truth, and I then	314:438,32E  !
5E	fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no	314:438,33E  !
5E	doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some	314:438,34E  !
5E	degree.~ She may not have surmised the whole, but her	314:438,35E  !
5E	quickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it.	314:438,36E  !
5E	You will find, whenever the subject becomes freed from	314:438,37E  !
5E	its present restraints, that it did not take her wholly	314:438,38E  !
5E	by surprise. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember	314:439, 1E  !
5E	her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs% Elton	314:439, 2E  !
5E	gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.~ I hope this	314:439, 3E  !
5E	history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by	314:439, 4E  !
5E	you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw	314:439, 5E  !
5E	amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against	314:439, 6E  !
5E	Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either.	314:439, 7E  !
5E	Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable,	314:439, 8E  !
5E	the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse,	314:439, 9E  !
5E	whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,	314:439,10E  !
5E	as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as	314:439,11E  !
5E	myself.~ Whatever strange things I said or did during	314:439,12E  !
5E	that fortnight, you have now a key to. My heart was in	314:439,13E  !
5E	Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither	314:439,14E  !
5E	as often as might be, and with the least suspicion. If you	314:439,15E  !
5E	remember any queerness, set them all to the right	314:439,16E  !
5E	account.~ Of the pianoforte= so much talked of, I feel it	314:439,17E  !
5E	only necessary to say, that its being ordered was absolutely	314:439,18E  !
5E	unknown to Miss% F@@, who would never have allowed	314:439,19E  !
5E	me to send it, had any choice been given her.~ The	314:439,20E  !
5E	delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,	314:439,21E  !
5E	my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing	314:439,22E  !
5E	justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her	314:439,23E  !
5E	thoroughly yourself.~ No description can describe her.	314:439,24E  !
5E	She must tell you herself what she is~ yet not by word,	314:439,25E  !
5E	for never was there a human creature who would so	314:439,26E  !
5E	designedly suppress her own merit.~ Since I began this	314:439,27E  !
5E	letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard	314:439,28E  !
5E	from her.~ She gives a good account of her own health;	314:439,29E  !
5E	but as she never complains, I dare not depend. I want	314:439,30E  !
5E	to have your opinion of her looks. I know you will soon	314:439,31E  !
5E	call on her; she is living in dread of the visit. Perhaps	314:439,32E  !
5E	it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay;	314:439,33E  !
5E	I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember	314:439,34E  !
5E	how few minutes I was at Randall's, and in how bewildered,	314:439,35E  !
5E	how mad a state: and I am not much better	314:439,36E  !
5E	yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. When	314:439,37E  !
5E	I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of	314:439,38E  !
5E	her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity,	314:440, 1E  !
5E	I am mad with joy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness	314:440, 2E  !
5E	I occasioned her, and how little I deserve to be	314:440, 3E  !
5E	forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her	314:440, 4E  !
5E	again|~ But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has	314:440, 5E  !
5E	been too good for me to encroach.~ I must still add to	314:440, 6E  !
5E	this long letter. You have not heard all that you ought	314:440, 7E  !
5E	to hear. I could not give any connected detail yesterday;	314:440, 8E  !
5E	but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness,	314:440, 9E  !
5E	with which the affair burst out, needs explanation;	314:440,10E  !
5E	for though the event of the 26th ult%, as you will conclude,	314:440,11E  !
5E	immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should	314:440,12E  !
5E	not have presumed on such early measures, but from the	314:440,13E  !
5E	very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour	314:440,14E  !
5E	to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so	314:440,15E  !
5E	hasty, and she would have felt every scruple of mine with	314:440,16E  !
5E	multiplied strength and refinement.~ But I had no	314:440,17E  !
5E	choice. The hasty engagement she had entered into with	314:440,18E  !
5E	that woman~ Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to	314:440,19E  !
5E	leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.~	314:440,20E  !
5E	I have been walking over the country, and am now,	314:440,21E  !
5E	I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter	314:440,22E  !
5E	what it ought to be.~ It is, in fact, a most mortifying	314:440,23E  !
5E	retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here	314:440,24E  !
5E	I can admit, that my manners to Miss W%, in being unpleasant	314:440,25E  !
5E	to Miss F%, were highly blamable. \She\ disapproved	314:440,26E  !
5E	them, which ought to have been enough.~ My	314:440,27E  !
5E	plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.	314:440,28E  !
5E	~ She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so;	314:440,29E  !
5E	I thought her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily	314:440,30E  !
5E	scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. But	314:440,31E  !
5E	she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and	314:440,32E  !
5E	subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper,	314:440,33E  !
5E	I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have	314:440,34E  !
5E	ever known.~ We quarrelled.~ Do you remember the	314:440,35E  !
5E	morning spent at Donwell?~ \There\ every little dissatisfaction	314:440,36E  !
5E	that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was	314:440,37E  !
5E	late; I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to	314:440,38E  !
5E	walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely	314:441, 1E  !
5E	refused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable.	314:441, 2E  !
5E	Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very	314:441, 3E  !
5E	natural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to	314:441, 4E  !
5E	blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one	314:441, 5E  !
5E	hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,	314:441, 6E  !
5E	was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which	314:441, 7E  !
5E	might have made every previous caution useless?~ Had	314:441, 8E  !
5E	we been met walking together between Donwell and	314:441, 9E  !
5E	Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.~ I was	314:441,10E  !
5E	mad enough, however, to resent.~ I doubted her affection.	314:441,11E  !
5E	I doubted it more the next day on Box-Hill; when,	314:441,12E  !
5E	provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful,	314:441,13E  !
5E	insolent neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to	314:441,14E  !
5E	Miss W%, as it would have been impossible for any woman	314:441,15E  !
5E	of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of	314:441,16E  !
5E	words perfectly intelligible to me.~ In short, my dear	314:441,17E  !
5E	madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable	314:441,18E  !
5E	on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,	314:441,19E  !
5E	though I might have staid with you till the next morning,	314:441,20E  !
5E	merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.	314:441,21E  !
5E	Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be	314:441,22E  !
5E	reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured	314:441,23E  !
5E	by her coldness, and I went away determined that she	314:441,24E  !
5E	should make the first advances.~ I shall always congratulate	314:441,25E  !
5E	myself that you were not of the Box-Hill party.	314:441,26E  !
5E	Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly	314:441,27E  !
5E	suppose you would ever have thought well of me again.	314:441,28E  !
5E	Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it	314:441,29E  !
5E	produced: as soon as she found I was really gone from	314:441,30E  !
5E	Randall's, she closed with the offer of that officious	314:441,31E  !
5E	Mrs% Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,	314:441,32E  !
5E	by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.	314:441,33E  !
5E	I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has	314:441,34E  !
5E	been so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise,	314:441,35E  !
5E	I should loudly protest against the share of it which that	314:441,36E  !
5E	woman has known.~	314:441,37E  !
5E	indeed|~ You will observe	314:441,37E  !
5E	that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that	314:441,38E  !
5E	name, even to you. Think, then, what I must have endured	314:442, 1E  !
5E	in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all	314:442, 2E  !
5E	the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence	314:442, 3E  !
5E	of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall	314:442, 4E  !
5E	soon have done.~ She closed with this offer, resolving to	314:442, 5E  !
5E	break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me	314:442, 6E  !
5E	that we never were to meet again.~	314:442, 7E  !
5E	This letter reached me on the very morning of my	314:442, 9E  !
5E	poor aunt's death. I answered it within an hour; but	314:442,10E  !
5E	from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of	314:442,11E  !
5E	business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being	314:442,12E  !
5E	sent with all the many other letters of that day, was	314:442,13E  !
5E	locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had	314:442,14E  !
5E	written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her,	314:442,15E  !
5E	remained without any uneasiness.~ I was rather disappointed	314:442,16E  !
5E	that I did not hear from her again speedily;	314:442,17E  !
5E	but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and~ may	314:442,18E  !
5E	I add?~ too cheerful in my views to be captious.~ We	314:442,19E  !
5E	removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received	314:442,20E  !
5E	a parcel from her, my own letters all returned|~ and	314:442,21E  !
5E	a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her	314:442,22E  !
5E	extreme surprise at not having had the smallest reply to	314:442,23E  !
5E	her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could	314:442,24E  !
5E	not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable	314:442,25E  !
5E	to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded	314:442,26E  !
5E	as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe conveyance,	314:442,27E  !
5E	all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly	314:442,28E  !
5E	command her's, so as to send them to Highbury within	314:442,29E  !
5E	a week, I would forward them after that period to her at	314:442,30E  !
5E	~~ : in short, the full direction to Mr% Smallridge's,	314:442,31E  !
5E	near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the name,	314:442,32E  !
5E	the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she	314:442,33E  !
5E	had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that	314:442,34E  !
5E	resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and	314:442,35E  !
5E	the secrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in	314:442,36E  !
5E	her former letter, was equally descriptive of its anxious	314:442,37E  !
5E	delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to	314:442,38E  !
5E	threaten me.~ Imagine the shock; imagine how, till	314:443, 1E  !
5E	I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the	314:443, 2E  !
5E	blunders of the post.~ What was to be done?~ One thing	314:443, 3E  !
5E	only.~ I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction	314:443, 4E  !
5E	I could not hope to be listened to again.~ I spoke; circumstances	314:443, 5E  !
5E	were in my favour; the late event had	314:443, 6E  !
5E	softened away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could	314:443, 7E  !
5E	have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; and	314:443, 8E  !
5E	could say at last, poor man| with a deep sigh, that he	314:443, 9E  !
5E	wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage	314:443,10E  !
5E	state as he had done.~ I felt that it would be of a different	314:443,11E  !
5E	sort.~ Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have	314:443,12E  !
5E	suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense	314:443,13E  !
5E	while all was at stake?~ No; do not pity me till I reached	314:443,14E  !
5E	Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity	314:443,15E  !
5E	me till I saw her wan, sick looks.~ I reached Highbury at	314:443,16E  !
5E	the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late	314:443,17E  !
5E	breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance of finding	314:443,18E  !
5E	her alone.~ I was not disappointed; and at last I was	314:443,19E  !
5E	not disappointed either in the object of my journey.	314:443,20E  !
5E	A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure	314:443,21E  !
5E	I had to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled,	314:443,22E  !
5E	dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's	314:443,23E  !
5E	uneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my	314:443,24E  !
5E	dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude	314:443,25E  !
5E	before. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the	314:443,26E  !
5E	kindness you have ever shown me, and ten thousand for	314:443,27E  !
5E	the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.~	314:443,28E  !
5E	If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve,	314:443,29E  !
5E	I am quite of your opinion.~ Miss W% calls me the child	314:443,30E  !
5E	of good fortune. I hope she is right.~ In one respect, my	314:443,31E  !
5E	good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe	314:443,32E  !
5E	myself,	314:443,33E  !

5B	words, were they?~ And a fine ending~	315:448, 2B  !
5B	and there is the letter. The child of good fortune| That	315:448, 3B  !
5B	was your name for him, was it?"	315:448, 4B  !
5A	"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as	315:448, 5A  !
5A	I am; but still you must, at least I hope you must, think	315:448, 6A  !
5A	the better of him for it. I hope it does him some service	315:448, 7A  !
5A	with you."	315:448, 8A  !
5B	"Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults	315:448, 9B  !
5B	of inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very	315:448,10B  !
5B	much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier	315:448,11B  !
5B	than he deserves: but still as he is, beyond a doubt,	315:448,12B  !
5B	really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be	315:448,13B  !
5B	hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her.	315:448,14B  !
5B	I am very ready to believe his character will improve,	315:448,15B  !
5B	and acquire from her's the steadiness and delicacy of	315:448,16B  !
5B	principle that it wants. And now, let me talk to you of	315:448,17B  !
5B	something else. I have another person's interest at present	315:448,18B  !
5B	so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about	315:448,19B  !
5B	Frank Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning,	315:448,20B  !
5B	Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject."	315:448,21B  !
5A	"While her dear father lived, any change of condition	315:448,27A  !
5A	must be impossible for her. She could never quit him."	315:448,28A  !
5A	"Ah| there is one difficulty unprovided for,"	315:449,24A  !
5A	"I am sure William Larkins will not like it. You	315:449,25A  !
5A	must get his consent before you ask mine."	315:449,26A  !
5D	"Beg her to walk up;"	316:452,37D  !
5I	"We can finish this some other time, you know. You	316:453,35I  !
5I	and I shall not want opportunities. And, in fact, you	316:453,36I  !
5I	have heard all the essential already. I only wanted to	316:453,37I  !
5I	prove to you that Mrs% S% admits our apology, and is not	316:453,38I  !
5I	offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh| she	316:454, 1I  !
5I	is a sweet creature| You would have doated on her, had	316:454, 2I  !
5I	you gone.~ But not a word more. Let us be discreet~	316:454, 3I  !
5I	quite on our good behaviour.~ Hush|~ You remember	316:454, 4I  !
5I	those lines~ I forget the poem at this moment:	316:454, 5I  !
5I	Now I say, my dear, in \our\ case, for \lady\, read ~ mum|	316:454, 8I  !
5I	a word to the wise.~ I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I?	316:454, 9I  !
5I	But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs% S%. ~ \My\	316:454,10I  !
5I	representation, you see, has quite appeased her."	316:454,11I  !
5I	"I mentioned no \names\, you will observe.~ Oh| no;	316:454,14I  !
5I	cautious as a minister of state. I managed it extremely	316:454,15I  !
5I	well."	316:454,16I  !
5I	"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little	316:454,21I  !
5I	friend here is charmingly recovered?~ Do not you think	316:454,22I  !
5I	her cure does Perry the highest credit?~	316:454,23I  !
5I	Upon my word,	316:454,24I  !
5I	Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time|~ Oh|	316:454,25I  !
5I	if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst|"	316:454,26I  !
5I	"We do not say a word of any \assistance\	316:454,28I  !
5I	that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young	316:454,29I  !
5I	physician from Windsor.~ Oh| no; Perry shall have all	316:454,30I  !
5I	the credit."	316:454,31I  !
5I	"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,"	316:454,32I  !
5I	"since the	316:454,33I  !
5I	party to Box-Hill. Very pleasant party. But yet I think	316:454,34I  !
5I	there was something wanting. Things did not seem~ that	316:454,35I  !
5I	is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.~ So	316:454,36I  !
5I	it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However,	316:454,37I  !
5I	I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again.	316:454,38I  !
5I	what say you both to our collecting the same party, and	316:455, 1I  !
5I	exploring to Box-Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?	316:455, 2I  !
5I	~ It must be the same party, you know, quite the same	316:455, 3I  !
5I	party, not \one\ exception."	316:455, 4I  !
5D	"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.~	316:455, 9D  !
5D	It is impossible to say~ Yes, indeed, I quite understand~	316:455,10D  !
5D	dearest Jane's prospects~ that is, I do not mean.~	316:455,11D  !
5D	But she is charmingly recovered.~ How is Mr% Woodhouse?~	316:455,12D  !
5D	I am so glad.~ Quite out of my power.~ Such	316:455,13D  !
5D	a happy little circle as you find us here.~ Yes, indeed.~	316:455,14D  !
5D	Charming young man|~ that is~ so very friendly; I mean	316:455,15D  !
5D	good Mr% Perry|~ such attention to Jane|"~	316:455,16D  !
5I	"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have	316:455,23I  !
5I	been so long, that anywhere else I should think it necessary	316:455,24I  !
5I	to apologize: but the truth is, that I am waiting for my	316:455,25I  !
5I	lord and master. He promised to join me here, and pay	316:455,26I  !
5I	his respects to you."	316:455,27I  !
5D	"What| are we to have the pleasure of a call from	316:455,28D  !
5D	Mr% Elton?~ That will be a favour indeed| for I know	316:455,29D  !
5D	gentlemen do not like morning visits, and Mr% Elton's	316:455,30D  !
5D	time is so engaged."	316:455,31D  !
5I	"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.~ He really is engaged	316:455,32I  !
5I	from morning to night.~ There is no end of people's	316:455,33I  !
5I	coming to him, on some pretence or other.~ The magistrates,	316:455,34I  !
5I	and overseers, and churchwardens, are always	316:455,35I  !
5I	wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing	316:455,36I  !
5I	without him.~ ""Upon my word, Mr% E%, I often say,rather	316:455,37I  !
5I	you than I.~ I do not know what would become of my	316:455,38I  !
5I	crayons and my instrument, if I had half so many	316:456, 1I  !
5I	applicants.""~ Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect	316:456, 2I  !
5I	them both to an unpardonable degree.~ I believe I have	316:456, 3I  !
5I	not played a bar this fortnight.~ However, he is coming,	316:456, 4I  !
5I	I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all."	316:456, 5I  !
5I	"A congratulatory visit, you know.~ Oh| yes,	316:456, 7I  !
5I	quite indispensable."	316:456, 8I  !
5I	"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage	316:456,10I  !
5I	himself from Knightley; but he and Knightley	316:456,11I  !
5I	are shut up together in deep consultation.~ Mr% E% is	316:456,12I  !
5I	Knightley's right hand."	316:456,13I  !
5A	"Is Mr% Elton gone on foot to Donwell?~ He will	316:456,15A  !
5A	have a hot walk."	316:456,16A  !
5I	"Oh| no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular	316:456,17I  !
5I	meeting. Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is	316:456,18I  !
5I	apt to speak only of those who lead.~ I fancy Mr% E% and	316:456,19I  !
5I	Knightley have every thing their own way."	316:456,20I  !
5A	"Have not you mistaken the day?"	316:456,21A  !
5A	"I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not	316:456,22A  !
5A	till to-morrow.~ Mr% Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday,	316:456,23A  !
5A	and spoke of it as for Saturday."	316:456,24A  !
5I	"Oh| no; the meeting is certainly to-day,"	316:456,25I  !
5I	"I do believe,"	316:456,27I  !
5I	"this is the most troublesome parish that ever	316:456,28I  !
5I	was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove."	316:456,29I  !
5I	"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never	316:456,31I  !
5I	heard the subject talked of."	316:456,32I  !
5I	"Ah| you clever creature, that's very true. What	316:456,37I  !
5I	a thinking brain you have| I say, Jane, what a perfect	316:456,38I  !
5I	character you and I should make, if we could be shaken	316:457, 1I  !
5I	together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce	316:457, 2I  !
5I	perfection.~ Not that I presume to insinuate, however,	316:457, 3I  !
5I	that \some\ people may not think \you\ perfection already.~	316:457, 4I  !
5I	But hush|~ not a word, if you please."	316:457, 5I  !
5I	"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here,	316:457,13I  !
5I	to be an encumbrance to my friends, so long before you	316:457,14I  !
5I	vouchsafe to come|~ But you knew what a dutiful	316:457,15I  !
5I	creature you had to deal with. You knew I should not	316:457,16I  !
5I	stir till my lord and master appeared.~ Here have I been	316:457,17I  !
5I	sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of	316:457,18I  !
5I	true conjugal obedience~ for who can say, you know, how	316:457,19I  !
5I	soon it may be wanted?"	316:457,20I  !
5I	"Donwell|"	316:457,30I  !
5I	"My dear Mr% E%, you	316:457,30I  !
5I	have not been to Donwell|~ You mean the Crown; you	316:457,31I  !
5I	come from the meeting at the Crown."	316:457,32I  !
5I	"I cannot imagine,"	316:458,10I  !
5I	"I cannot imagine how	316:458,11I  !
5I	he could do such a thing by you, of all people in the world|	316:458,12I  !
5I	The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten|~	316:458,13I  !
5I	My dear Mr% E%, he must have left a message for	316:458,14I  !
5I	you, I am sure he must.~ Not even Knightley could be	316:458,15I  !
5I	so very eccentric;~ and his servants forgot it. Depend	316:458,16I  !
5I	upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen	316:458,17I  !
5I	with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often	316:458,18I  !
5I	observed, extremely awkward and remiss.~ I am sure	316:458,19I  !
5I	I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at	316:458,20I  !
5I	our sideboard for any consideration. And as for Mrs% Hodges,	316:458,21I  !
5I	Wright holds her very cheap indeed.~ She	316:458,22I  !
5I	promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it."	316:458,23I  !
5A	"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.	316:459, 5A  !
5A	Had you not been surrounded by other friends,	316:459, 6A  !
5A	I might have been tempted to introduce a subject, to ask	316:459, 7A  !
5A	questions, to speak more openly than might have been	316:459, 8A  !
5A	strictly correct.~ I feel that I should certainly have been	316:459, 9A  !
5A	impertinent."	316:459,10A  !
5A	"Oh| you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,"	316:459,26A  !
5A	"You owe me no	316:459,27A  !
5A	apologies; and every body to whom you might be supposed	316:459,28A  !
5A	to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted even ~"	316:459,29A  !
5A	"Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should	316:459,34A  !
5A	be on my side. Let us forgive each other at once. We	316:459,35A  !
5A	must do whatever is to be done quickest, and I think our	316:459,36A  !
5A	feelings will lose no time there. I hope you have pleasant	316:459,37A  !
5A	accounts from Windsor?"	316:459,38A  !
5A	"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to	316:460, 2A  !
5A	lose you~ just as I begin to know you."	316:460, 3A  !
5A	"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,"	316:460, 7A  !
5A	"but, excuse me, it must be thought of."	316:460, 8A  !
5A	"Thank you, thank you.~ This is just what I wanted	316:460,16A  !
5A	to be assured of.~ Oh| if you knew how much I love	316:460,17A  !
5A	every thing that is decided and open|~ Good bye, good bye."	316:460,18A  !
5A	"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising	317:461,17A  !
5A	on me,"	317:461,18A  !
5A	"like La Baronne d'Almane on	317:461,18A  !
5A	La Comtesse d'Ostalis', in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore,	317:461,19A  !
5A	and we shall now see her own little Adelaide	317:461,20A  !
5A	educated on a more perfect plan."	317:461,21A  !
5B	"That is,"	317:461,22B  !
5B	"she will indulge	317:461,22B  !
5B	her even more than she did you, and believe that she does	317:461,23B  !
5B	not indulge her at all. It will be the only difference."	317:461,24B  !
5A	"Poor child|"	317:461,25A  !
5A	"at that rate, what will	317:461,25A  !
5A	become of her?"	317:461,26A  !
5B	"Nothing very bad.~ The fate of thousands. She will	317:461,27B  !
5B	be disagreeable in infancy, and correct herself as she grows	317:461,28B  !
5B	older. I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children,	317:461,29B  !
5B	my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all my happiness	317:461,30B  !
5B	to \you\, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be	317:461,31B  !
5B	severe on them?"	317:461,32B  !
5A	"But I had the assistance	317:462, 1A  !
5A	of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other	317:462, 2A  !
5A	people. I doubt whether my own sense would have	317:462, 3A  !
5A	corrected me without it."	317:462, 4A  !
5B	"Do you?~ I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:~	317:462, 5B  !
5B	Miss Taylor gave you principles. You must	317:462, 6B  !
5B	have done well. My interference was quite as likely to do	317:462, 7B  !
5B	harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what	317:462, 8B  !
5B	right has he to lecture me?~ and I am afraid very natural	317:462, 9B  !
5B	for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner.	317:462,10B  !
5B	I do not believe I did you any good. The good was all to	317:462,11B  !
5B	myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection	317:462,12B  !
5B	to me. I could not think about you so much without	317:462,13B  !
5B	doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying	317:462,14B  !
5B	so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you	317:462,15B  !
5B	were thirteen at least."	317:462,16B  !
5A	"I am sure you were of use to me,"	317:462,17A  !
5A	"I was very often influenced rightly by you~ oftener than	317:462,18A  !
5A	I would own at the time. I am very sure you did me good.	317:462,19A  !
5A	And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled, it will be	317:462,20A  !
5A	the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you	317:462,21A  !
5A	have done for me, except falling in love with her when	317:462,22A  !
5A	she is thirteen."	317:462,23A  !
5B	"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me,	317:462,24B  !
5B	with one of your saucy looks~	317:462,25B  !
5A	""Mr% Knightley, I am going	317:462,25A  !
5A	to do so and so; papa says I may, or, I have Miss Taylor's	317:462,26A  !
5A	leave""~	317:462,27A  !
5B	something which, you knew, I did not approve.	317:462,27B  !
5B	In such cases my interference was giving you two bad	317:462,28B  !
5B	feelings instead of one."	317:462,29B  !
5A	"What an amiable creature I was|~ No wonder you	317:462,30A  !
5A	should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance."	317:462,31A  !
5A	""Mr% Knightley.""~	317:462,33A  !
5B	You always called me,	317:462,33B  !
5A	""Mr% Knightley;""	317:462,33A  !
5B	and, from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.	317:462,34B  !
5B	~ And yet it is formal. I want you to call me something	317:462,35B  !
5B	else, but I do not know what."	317:462,36B  !
5A	"I remember once calling you ""George,"" in one of my	317:462,37A  !
5A	amiable fits, about ten years ago. I did it because	317:462,38A  !
5A	I thought it would offend you; but, as you made no	317:463, 1A  !
5A	objection, I never did it again."	317:463, 2A  !
5B	"And cannot you call me	317:463, 3B  !
5A	""George""	317:463, 3A  !
5B	now?"	317:463, 3B  !
5A	"Impossible|~ I never can call you any thing but	317:463, 4A  !
5A	""Mr% Knightley."" I will not promise even to equal the	317:463, 5A  !
5A	elegant terseness of Mrs% Elton, by calling you Mr% K%~	317:463, 6A  !
5A	But I will promise,"	317:463, 7A  !
5A	"I will promise to call you once by your	317:463, 8A  !
5A	Christian name. I do not say when, but perhaps you may	317:463, 9A  !
5A	guess where;~ in the building in which N% takes M% for	317:463,10A  !
5A	better, for worse."	317:463,11A  !
5B	"John does not even mention your friend,"	317:464, 4B  !
5B	"Here is his answer, if you like to see it."	317:464, 5B  !
5B	"John enters like a brother into my happiness,"	317:464,11B  !
5B	"but he is no complimenter; and	317:464,12B  !
5B	though I well know him to have, likewise, a most brotherly	317:464,13B  !
5B	affection for you, he is so far from making flourishes, that	317:464,14B  !
5B	any other young woman might think him rather cool in her	317:464,15B  !
5B	praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he	317:464,16B  !
5B	writes."	317:464,17B  !
5A	"He writes like a sensible man,"	317:464,18A  !
5A	"I honour his sincerity. It is	317:464,19A  !
5A	very plain that he considers the good fortune of the	317:464,20A  !
5A	engagement as all on my side, but that he is not without	317:464,21A  !
5A	hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection,	317:464,22A  !
5A	as you think me already. Had he said any thing to bear	317:464,23A  !
5A	a different construction, I should not have believed him."	317:464,24A  !
5B	"My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means	317:464,25B  !
5B	~ "	317:464,26B  !
5A	"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of	317:464,27A  !
5A	the two,"	317:464,28A  !
5A	"much less, perhaps, than he is aware of, if we could	317:464,29A  !
5A	enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject."	317:464,30A  !
5B	"Emma, my dear Emma ~"	317:464,31B  !
5A	"Oh|"	317:464,32A  !
5A	"if you	317:464,32A  !
5A	fancy your brother does not do me justice, only wait till	317:464,33A  !
5A	my dear father is in the secret, and hear his opinion.	317:464,34A  !
5A	Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing \you\	317:464,35A  !
5A	justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage,	317:464,36A  !
5A	on your side of the question; all the merit on mine.	317:464,37A  !
5A	I wish I may not sink into ""poor Emma"" with him at once.	317:464,38A  !
5A	~ His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go	317:465, 1A  !
5A	no farther."	317:465, 2A  !
5B	"Ah|"	317:465, 3B  !
5B	"I wish your father might be half as	317:465, 3B  !
5B	easily convinced as John will be, of our having every right	317:465, 4B  !
5B	that equal worth can give, to be happy together. I am	317:465, 5B  !
5B	amused by one part of John's letter~ did you notice it?~	317:465, 6B  !
5B	where he says, that my information did not take him	317:465, 7B  !
5B	wholly by surprise, that he was rather in expectation of	317:465, 8B  !
5B	hearing something of the kind."	317:465, 9B  !
5A	"If I understand your brother, he only means so far	317:465,10A  !
5A	as your having some thoughts of marrying. He had no	317:465,11A  !
5A	idea of me. He seems perfectly unprepared for that."	317:465,12A  !
5B	"Yes, yes~ but I am amused that he should have seen	317:465,13B  !
5B	so far into my feelings. What has he been judging by?~	317:465,14B  !
5B	I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation	317:465,15B  !
5B	that could prepare him at this time for my	317:465,16B  !
5B	marrying any more than at another.~ But it was so,	317:465,17B  !
5B	I suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was	317:465,18B  !
5B	staying with them the other day. I believe I did not play	317:465,19B  !
5B	with the children quite so much as usual. I remember one	317:465,20B  !
5B	evening the poor boys saying,	317:465,21B  !
5N	"It is to be a secret, I conclude,"	317:468,22N  !
5N	"These	317:468,22N  !
5N	matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body	317:468,23N  !
5N	knows them. Only let me be told when I may	317:468,24N  !
5N	speak out.~ I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion."	317:468,25N  !
5I	"Poor Knightley| poor fellow|~ sad business for him.~"	317:469,12I  !
5I	She was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric,	317:469,13I  !
5I	he had a thousand good qualities.~ How could he be so	317:469,14I  !
5I	taken in?~ Did not think him at all in love~ not in the	317:469,15I  !
5I	least.~ Poor Knightley|~ There would be an end of all	317:469,16I  !
5I	pleasant intercourse with him.~ How happy he had been	317:469,17I  !
5I	to come and dine with them whenever they asked him|	317:469,18I  !
5I	But that would be all over now.~ Poor fellow|~ No more	317:469,19I  !
5I	exploring parties to Donwell made for \her\. Oh| no;	317:469,20I  !
5I	there would be a Mrs% Knightley to throw cold water on	317:469,21I  !
5I	every thing.~ Extremely disagreeable| But she was not	317:469,22I  !
5I	at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other	317:469,23I  !
5I	day.~ Shocking plan, living together. It would never do.	317:469,24I  !
5I	She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it, and	317:469,25I  !
5I	been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter.	317:469,26I  !
5B	"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."	318:470, 8B  !
5A	"Good or bad?"	318:470, 9A  !
5B	"I do not know which it ought to be called."	318:470,11B  !
5A	"Oh| good I am sure.~ I see it in your countenance.	318:470,12A  !
5A	You are trying not to smile."	318:470,13A  !
5B	"I am afraid,"	318:470,14B  !
5B	"I am	318:470,14B  !
5B	very much afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile	318:470,15B  !
5B	when you hear it."	318:470,16B  !
5A	"Indeed| but why so?~ I can hardly imagine that	318:470,17A  !
5A	any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please	318:470,18A  !
5A	and amuse me too."	318:470,19A  !
5B	"There is one subject,"	318:470,20B  !
5B	"I hope but one,	318:470,20B  !
5B	on which we do not think alike."	318:470,21B  !
5B	"Does	318:470,22B  !
5B	nothing occur to you?~ Do not you recollect?~ Harriet Smith."	318:470,23B  !
5B	"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?"	318:470,26B  !
5B	"You have, I believe, and know the whole."	318:470,27B  !
5A	"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."	318:470,28A  !
5B	"You are prepared for the worst, I see~ and very bad	318:470,29B  !
5B	it is. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."	318:470,30B  !
5B	"It is so, indeed,"	318:471, 3B  !
5B	"I have	318:471, 3B  !
5B	it from Robert Martin himself. He left me not half an	318:471, 4B  !
5B	hour ago."	318:471, 5B  !
5B	"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.~ I wish	318:471, 8B  !
5B	our opinions were the same. But in time they will. Time,	318:471, 9B  !
5B	you may be very sure, will make one or the other of us	318:471,10B  !
5B	think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not talk	318:471,11B  !
5B	much on the subject."	318:471,12B  !
5A	"You mistake me, you quite mistake me,"	318:471,13A  !
5A	"It is not that such a circumstance	318:471,14A  !
5A	would now make me unhappy, but I cannot believe it.	318:471,15A  !
5A	It seems an impossibility|~ You cannot mean to say, that	318:471,16A  !
5A	Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot	318:471,17A  !
5A	mean that he has even proposed to her again~ yet. You	318:471,18A  !
5A	only mean, that he intends it."	318:471,19A  !
5B	"I mean that he has done it,"	318:471,20B  !
5B	"and been accepted."	318:471,21B  !
5A	"Good God|"	318:471,23A  !
5A	"Well|"~	318:471,23A  !
5A	"Well, now tell me every thing; make this	318:471,27A  !
5A	intelligible to me. How, where, when?~ Let me know it	318:471,28A  !
5A	all. I never was more surprised~ but it does not make	318:471,29A  !
5A	me unhappy, I assure you.~ How~ how has it been possible?"	318:471,30A  !
5B	"It is a very simple story. He went to town on	318:471,32B  !
5B	business three days ago, and I got him to take charge of	318:471,33B  !
5B	some papers which I was wanting to send to John.~ He	318:471,34B  !
5B	delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was	318:471,35B  !
5B	asked by him to join their party the same evening to	318:471,36B  !
5B	Astley's. They were going to take the two eldest boys	318:471,37B  !
5B	to Astley's. The party was to be our brother and sister,	318:471,38B  !
5B	Henry, John~ and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could	318:472, 1B  !
5B	not resist. They called for him in their way; were all	318:472, 2B  !
5B	extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine	318:472, 3B  !
5B	with them the next day~ which he did~ and in the course	318:472, 4B  !
5B	of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of	318:472, 5B  !
5B	speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.	318:472, 6B  !
5B	~She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he	318:472, 7B  !
5B	is deserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and	318:472, 8B  !
5B	was with me this morning immediately after breakfast,	318:472, 9B  !
5B	to report his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on	318:472,10B  !
5B	his own. This is all that I can relate of the how, where,	318:472,11B  !
5B	and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer	318:472,12B  !
5B	history when you see her.~ She will give you all the	318:472,13B  !
5B	minute particulars, which only woman's language can	318:472,14B  !
5B	make interesting.~ In our communications we deal only	318:472,15B  !
5B	in the great.~ However, I must say that Robert Martin's	318:472,16B  !
5B	heart seemed for \him\, and to \me\, very overflowing; and	318:472,17B  !
5B	that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose,	318:472,18B  !
5B	that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother	318:472,19B  !
5B	took charge of Mrs% John Knightley and little John, and	318:472,20B  !
5B	he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one	318:472,21B  !
5B	time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith	318:472,22B  !
5B	rather uneasy."	318:472,23B  !
5B	"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance	318:472,30B  !
5B	would not now make you unhappy; but I am afraid it	318:472,31B  !
5B	gives you more pain than you expected. His situation is	318:472,32B  !
5B	an evil~ but you must consider it as what satisfies your	318:472,33B  !
5B	friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and	318:472,34B  !
5B	better of him as you know him more. His good sense and	318:472,35B  !
5B	good principles would delight you.~ As far as the man is	318:472,36B  !
5B	concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands.	318:472,37B  !
5B	His rank in society I would alter if I could; which is saying	318:472,38B  !
5B	a great deal I assure you, Emma.~ You laugh at me about	318:473, 1B  !
5B	William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."	318:473, 2B  !
5A	"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the	318:473, 7A  !
5A	match. I think Harriet is doing extremely well. \Her\	318:473, 8A  !
5A	connexions may be worse than \his\. In respectability of	318:473, 9A  !
5A	character, there can be no doubt that they are. I have	318:473,10A  !
5A	been silent from surprise merely, excessive surprise. You	318:473,11A  !
5A	cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me| how	318:473,12A  !
5A	peculiarly unprepared I was|~ for I had reason to believe	318:473,13A  !
5A	her very lately more determined against him, much more,	318:473,14A  !
5A	than she was before."	318:473,15A  !
5B	"You ought to know your friend best,"	318:473,16B  !
5B	"but I should say she was a good-tempered,	318:473,17B  !
5B	soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined	318:473,18B  !
5B	against any young man who told her he loved her."	318:473,19B  !
5A	"Upon	318:473,20A  !
5A	my word, I believe you know her quite as well as I do.~	318:473,21A  !
5A	But, Mr% Knightley, are you perfectly sure that she has	318:473,22A  !
5A	absolutely and downright \accepted\ him.~ I could suppose	318:473,23A  !
5A	she might in time~ but can she already?~ Did not you	318:473,24A  !
5A	misunderstand him?~ You were both talking of other	318:473,25A  !
5A	things; of business, shows of cattle, or new drills~ and	318:473,26A  !
5A	might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects,	318:473,27A  !
5A	mistake him?~ It was not Harriet's hand that he was	318:473,28A  !
5A	certain of~ it was the dimensions of some famous ox."	318:473,29A  !
5M	"No, I hope I know better than to think of	318:473,35M  !
5M	Robert Martin,"	318:473,36M  !
5B	"Do you dare say this?"	318:474, 1B  !
5B	"Do	318:474, 1B  !
5B	you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to	318:474, 2B  !
5B	know what a man is talking of?~ What do you deserve?"	318:474, 3B  !
5A	"Oh| I always deserve the best treatment, because	318:474, 4A  !
5A	I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must	318:474, 5A  !
5A	give me a plain, direct answer. Are you quite sure that	318:474, 6A  !
5A	you understand the terms on which Mr% Martin and	318:474, 7A  !
5A	Harriet now are?"	318:474, 8A  !
5B	"I am quite sure,"	318:474, 9B  !
5B	"that he told me she had accepted him; and that there	318:474,10B  !
5B	was no obscurity, nothing doubtful, in the words he used;	318:474,11B  !
5B	and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so.	318:474,12B  !
5B	He asked my opinion as to	318:474,13B  !
5B	I assured him that I could not.	318:474,17B  !
5B	he said,	318:474,17B  !
5A	"I am perfectly satisfied,"	318:474,19A  !
5A	"and most sincerely wish them happy."	318:474,20A  !
5B	"You are materially changed since we talked on this	318:474,21B  !
5B	subject before."	318:474,22B  !
5A	"I hope so~ for at that time I was a fool."	318:474,23A  !
5B	"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing	318:474,24B  !
5B	to grant you all Harriet's good qualities. I have taken	318:474,25B  !
5B	some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin's sake,	318:474,26B  !
5B	(whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love	318:474,27B  !
5B	with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often	318:474,28B  !
5B	talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did.	318:474,29B  !
5B	Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting	318:474,30B  !
5B	me of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was	318:474,31B  !
5B	never the case: but, from all my observations, I am	318:474,32B  !
5B	convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very	318:474,33B  !
5B	good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing	318:474,34B  !
5B	her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.	318:474,35B  !
5B	~ Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for."	318:474,36B  !
5A	"Me|"	318:474,37A  !
5A	"Ah| poor	318:474,37A  !
5A	Harriet|"	318:474,38A  !
5O	"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,"	318:476,12O  !
5O	"I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprise in	318:476,13O  !
5O	seeing him arrive this morning. He stays till to-morrow,	318:476,14O  !
5O	and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day	318:476,15O  !
5O	with us.~ They are coming in, I hope."	318:476,16O  !
5E	"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind	318:476,31E  !
5E	forgiving message in one of Mrs% Weston's letters. I hope	318:476,32E  !
5E	time has not made you less willing to pardon. I hope you	318:476,33E  !
5E	do not retract what you then said."	318:476,34E  !
5A	"No, indeed,"	318:476,35A  !
5A	"not	318:476,35A  !
5A	in the least. I am particularly glad to see and shake	318:476,36A  !
5A	hands with you~ and to give you joy in person."	318:476,37A  !
5E	"Is not she looking well?"	318:477, 3E  !
5E	"Better than she ever used to do?~ You	318:477, 4E  !
5E	see how my father and Mrs% Weston doat upon her."	318:477, 5E  !
5A	"I can never think of it,"	318:477,10A  !
5A	"without extreme	318:477,10A  !
5A	shame."	318:477,11A  !
5E	"The shame,"	318:477,12E  !
5E	"is all mine, or ought to be.	318:477,12E  !
5E	But is it possible that you had no suspicion?~ I mean of	318:477,13E  !
5E	late. Early, I know you had none."	318:477,14E  !
5A	"I never had the smallest, I assure you."	318:477,15A  !
5E	"That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near	318:477,16E  !
5E	~ and I wish I had~ it would have been better. But	318:477,17E  !
5E	though I was always doing wrong things, they were very	318:477,18E  !
5E	\bad\ wrong things, and such as did me no service.~ It	318:477,19E  !
5E	would have been a much better transgression had I broken	318:477,20E  !
5E	the bond of secrecy and told you every thing."	318:477,21E  !
5A	"It is not now worth a regret,"	318:477,22A  !
5E	"I have some hope,"	318:477,23E  !
5E	"of my uncle's being	318:477,23E  !
5E	persuaded to pay a visit at Randall's; he wants to be	318:477,24E  !
5E	introduced to her. When the Campbells are returned, we	318:477,25E  !
5E	shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,	318:477,26E  !
5E	till we may carry her northward.~ But now, I am at such	318:477,27E  !
5E	a distance from her~ is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?~	318:477,28E  !
5E	Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of	318:477,29E  !
5E	reconciliation. Do not you pity me?"	318:477,30E  !
5E	"Ah| by the bye,"~	318:477,33E  !
5E	"I hope Mr% Knightley is well?"	318:477,34E  !
5E	"I know you	318:477,35E  !
5E	saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish in	318:477,36E  !
5E	your favour. Let me return your congratulations.~	318:477,37E  !
5E	I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest	318:477,38E  !

5E	such delicacy|~ and yet without being actually fair.~	318:478, 8E  !
5E	One cannot call her fair. It is a most uncommon complexion,	318:478, 9E  !
5E	with her dark eye-lashes and hair~ a most distinguishing	318:478,10E  !
5E	complexion|~ So peculiarly the lady in it.~	318:478,11E  !
5E	Just colour enough for beauty."	318:478,12E  !

5E	"Oh| no~ what an impudent dog I was|~ How could	318:478,17E  !
5E	I dare~"	318:478,18E  !
5A	"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at	318:478,21A  !
5A	that time, you had very great amusement in tricking us	318:478,22A  !
5A	all.~ I am sure you had.~ I am sure it was a consolation	318:478,23A  !
5A	to you."	318:478,24A  !
5E	"Oh| no, no, no~ how can you suspect me of such	318:478,25E  !
5E	a thing?~ I was the most miserable wretch|"	318:478,26E  !
5A	"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.	318:478,27A  !
5A	I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you, to	318:478,28A  !
5A	feel that you were taking us all in.~ Perhaps I am the	318:478,29A  !
5A	readier to suspect, because, to tell you the truth, I think	318:478,30A  !
5A	it might have been some amusement to myself in the	318:478,31A  !
5A	same situation. I think there is a little likeness between	318:478,32A  !
5A	us."	318:478,33A  !
5A	"If not in our dispositions,"	318:478,35A  !
5A	"there is a likeness in our	318:478,36A  !
5A	destiny; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with	318:478,37A  !
5A	two characters so much superior to our own."	318:478,38A  !
5E	"True, true,"	318:479, 1E  !
5E	"No, not true on	318:479, 1E  !
5E	your side. You can have no superior, but most true on	318:479, 2E  !
5E	mine.~ She is a complete angel. Look at her. Is not she	318:479, 3E  !
5E	an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her	318:479, 4E  !
5E	throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my	318:479, 5E  !
5E	father.~ You will be glad to hear	318:479, 6E  !
5E	that my uncle means to give her all	318:479, 7E  !
5E	my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set. I am resolved	318:479, 8E  !
5E	to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be	318:479, 9E  !
5E	beautiful in her dark hair?"	318:479,10E  !
5A	"Very beautiful, indeed,"	318:479,11A  !
5E	"How delighted I am to see you again| and to see you	318:479,13E  !
5E	in such excellent looks|~ I would not have missed this	318:479,14E  !
5E	meeting for the world. I should certainly have called at	318:479,15E  !
5E	Hartfield, had you failed to come."	318:479,16E  !
5P	"She should always send for Perry, if	318:479,28P  !
5P	the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were	318:479,29P  !
5P	it only for a moment. She could not be too soon alarmed,	318:479,30P  !
5P	nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps, that	318:479,31P  !
5P	he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed	318:479,32P  !
5P	well now, very well considering, it would probably have	318:479,33P  !
5P	been better if Perry had seen it."	318:479,34P  !
5E	"Perry|"	318:479,36E  !
5E	"My friend Mr% Perry|	318:479,37E  !
5E	What are they saying about Mr% Perry?~ Has he been	318:479,38E  !
5E	here this morning?~ And how does he travel now?~	318:480, 1E  !
5E	Has he set up his carriage?"	318:480, 2E  !
5E	"Such an extraordinary dream of mine|"	318:480, 7E  !
5E	"I can never think of it without laughing.~ She hears us,	318:480, 8E  !
5E	she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see it in her cheek, her	318:480, 9E  !
5E	smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do not	318:480,10E  !
5E	you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own	318:480,11E  !
5E	letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye	318:480,12E  !
5E	~ that the whole blunder is spread before her~ that she	318:480,13E  !
5E	can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen	318:480,14E  !
5E	to the others?"	318:480,15E  !
5I	"Very little white satin, very few lace veils;	319:484,18I  !
5I	a most pitiful business|~ Selina would stare when she	319:484,19I  !
5I	heard of it."	319:484,20I  !
6A	"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us,	103: 19,12A  !
6A	have at least an equal claim with any other set of men, for	103: 19,13A  !
6A	all the comforts and all the privileges which any home	103: 19,14A  !
6A	can give.  Sailors work hard enough for their comforts,	103: 19,15A  !
6A	we must all allow."	103: 19,16A  !
6A	"He is rear admiral of the white.  He was in the	103: 21,38A  !
6A	Trafalgar action, and has been in the East Indies since;	103: 22, 1A  !
6A	he has been stationed there, I believe, several years."	103: 22, 2A  !
6A	"You mean Mr% Wentworth, I suppose,"	103: 23,24A  !
6A	"a few months more, and	103: 25, 5A  !
6A	\he\, perhaps, may be walking here."	103: 25, 6A  !
6D	"I thought we should	105: 32,29D  !
6D	soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told	105: 32,30D  !
6D	us at Taunton.  The baronet will never set the Thames on	105: 32,31D  !
6D	fire, but there seems no harm in him:" ~	105: 32,32D  !
6P	"I cannot possibly do without Anne,"	105: 33,30P  !
6A	"There is hardly any personal defect,"	105: 35,25A  !
6A	"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile	105: 35,26A  !
6A	one to."	105: 35,27A  !
6P	"So, you are come at last|  I began to think I should	105: 37,18P  !
6P	never see you.  I am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have	105: 37,19P  !
6P	not seen a creature the whole morning|"	105: 37,20P  !
6A	"I am sorry to find you unwell,"	105: 37,21A  !
6A	"You	105: 37,21A  !
6A	sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday|"	105: 37,22A  !
6P	"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do; but I was	105: 37,23P  !
6P	very far from well at the time; and I do not think I ever	105: 37,24P  !
6P	was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning ~ very	105: 37,25P  !
6P	unfit to be left alone, I am sure.  Suppose I were to be	105: 37,26P  !
6P	seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not able	105: 37,27P  !
6P	to ring the bell|  So, Lady Russell would not get out.	105: 37,28P  !
6P	I do not think she has been in this house three times	105: 37,29P  !
6P	this summer."	105: 37,30P  !
6P	"Oh| Charles is out shooting.  I have not	105: 37,32P  !
6P	seen him since seven o'clock.  He would go, though I told	105: 37,33P  !
6P	him how ill I was.  He said he should not stay out long;	105: 37,34P  !
6P	but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.	105: 37,35P  !
6P	I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long	105: 37,36P  !
6P	morning."	105: 37,37P  !
6A	"You have had your little boys with you?"	105: 37,38A  !
6P	"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are	105: 38, 1P  !
6P	so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good.	105: 38, 2P  !
6P	Little Charles does not mind a word I say, and Walter	105: 38, 3P  !
6P	is growing quite as bad."	105: 38, 4P  !
6A	"Well, you will soon be better now,"	105: 38, 5A  !
6A	"You know I always cure you when I come.	105: 38, 6A  !
6A	How are your neighbours at the Great House?"	105: 38, 7A  !
6P	"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen	105: 38, 8P  !
6P	one of them to-day, except Mr% Musgrove, who just	105: 38, 9P  !
6P	stopped and spoke through the window, but without	105: 38,10P  !
6P	getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,	105: 38,11P  !
6P	not one of them had been near me.  It did not happen	105: 38,12P  !
6P	to suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never	105: 38,13P  !
6P	put themselves out of their way."	105: 38,14P  !
6A	"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning	105: 38,15A  !
6A	is gone.  It is early."	105: 38,16A  !
6P	"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh	105: 38,17P  !
6P	a great deal too much for me.  Oh| Anne, I am so very	105: 38,18P  !
6P	unwell|  It was quite unkind of you not to come on	105: 38,19P  !
6P	Thursday."	105: 38,20P  !
6A	"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account	105: 38,21A  !
6A	you sent me of yourself|  You wrote in the cheerfullest	105: 38,22A  !
6A	manner, and said you were perfectly well, and in no	105: 38,23A  !
6A	hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be	105: 38,24A  !
6A	aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell	105: 38,25A  !
6A	to the last:  and besides what I felt on her	105: 38,26A  !
6A	account, I have really been so busy, have had so much	105: 38,27A  !
6A	to do, that I could not very conveniently have left	105: 38,28A  !
6A	Kellynch sooner."	105: 38,29A  !
6P	"Dear me| what can \you\ possibly have to do?"	105: 38,30P  !
6A	"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can	105: 38,31A  !
6A	recollect in a moment:  but I can tell you some.  I have	105: 38,32A  !
6A	been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's	105: 38,33A  !
6A	books and pictures.  I have been several times in the	105: 38,34A  !
6A	garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make	105: 38,35A  !
6A	him understand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell.	105: 38,36A  !
6A	I have had all my own little concerns to arrange	105: 38,37A  !
6A	~ books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,	105: 38,38A  !
6A	from not having understood in time what was intended	105: 39, 1A  !
6A	as to the waggons.  And one thing I have had to do,	105: 39, 2A  !
6A	Mary, of a more trying nature; going to almost every	105: 39, 3A  !
6A	house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.  I was told	105: 39, 4A  !
6A	that they wished it.  But all these things took up a great	105: 39, 5A  !
6A	deal of time."	105: 39, 6A  !
6P	"Oh| well;" ~	105: 39, 7P  !
6P	"But	105: 39, 7P  !
6P	you have never asked me one word about our dinner at	105: 39, 8P  !
6P	the Pooles yesterday."	105: 39, 9P  !
6A	"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because	105: 39,10A  !
6A	I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the	105: 39,11A  !
6A	party."	105: 39,12A  !
6P	"Oh| yes, I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing	105: 39,13P  !
6P	at all the matter with me till this morning.  It would have	105: 39,14P  !
6P	been strange if I had not gone."	105: 39,15P  !
6A	"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope	105: 39,16A  !
6A	you had a pleasant party."	105: 39,17A  !
6P	"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand	105: 39,18P  !
6P	what the dinner will be, and who will be there.  And it	105: 39,19P  !
6P	is so very uncomfortable, not having a carriage of one's	105: 39,20P  !
6P	own.  Mr% and Mrs% Musgrove took me, and we were	105: 39,21P  !
6P	so crowded|  They are both so very large, and take up	105: 39,22P  !
6P	so much room|  And Mr% Musgrove always sits forward.	105: 39,23P  !
6P	So, there was I, crowded into the back seat with Henrietta	105: 39,24P  !
6P	and Louisa.  And I think it very likely that my illness	105: 39,25P  !
6P	to-day may be owing to it."	105: 39,26P  !
6P	"Where shall we go?"	105: 39,35P  !
6P	"I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House	105: 39,36P  !
6P	before they have been to see you?"	105: 39,37P  !
6A	"I have not the smallest objection on that account,"	105: 39,38A  !
6A	"I should never think of standing on such	105: 40, 1A  !
6A	ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs% and the	105: 40, 2A  !
6A	Miss Musgroves."	105: 40, 3A  !
6P	"Oh| but they ought to call upon you as soon as	105: 40, 4P  !
6P	possible.  They ought to feel what is due to you as \my\	105: 40, 5P  !
6P	sister.  However, we may as well go and sit with them	105: 40, 6P  !
6P	a little while, and when we have got that over, we can	105: 40, 7P  !
6P	enjoy our walk."	105: 40, 8P  !
6P	"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off,	106: 42,25P  !
6P	when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath|"	106: 42,26P  !
6P	"Charles spoils the children	106: 44,13P  !
6P	so that I cannot get them into any order," ~	106: 44,14P  !
6P	"I do believe if	106: 44,24P  !
6P	Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there	106: 44,25P  !
6P	was any thing the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne,	106: 44,26P  !
6P	if you would, you might persuade him that I really am	106: 44,27P  !
6P	very ill ~ a great deal worse than I ever own."	106: 44,28P  !
6P	"I hate sending the children	106: 44,29P  !
6P	to the Great House, though their grandmamma is always	106: 44,30P  !
6P	wanting to see them, for she humours and indulges them	106: 44,31P  !
6P	to such a degree, and gives them so much trash and sweet	106: 44,32P  !
6P	things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross	106: 44,33P  !
6P	for the rest of the day." ~	106: 44,34P  !
6P	"Mrs% Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady, that	106: 45,15P  !
6P	it would be high treason to call it in question; but I am	106: 45,16P  !
6P	sure, without exaggeration, that her upper house-maid	106: 45,17P  !
6P	and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are	106: 45,18P  !
6P	gadding about the village, all day long.  I meet them	106: 45,19P  !
6P	wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my	106: 45,20P  !
6P	nursery without seeing something of them.  If Jemima	106: 45,21P  !
6P	were not the trustiest, steadiest creature in the world,	106: 45,22P  !
6P	it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells me, they	106: 45,23P  !
6P	are always tempting her to take a walk with them."	106: 45,24P  !
6P	"Dear me| is not this the day the Crofts	106: 48, 5P  !
6P	were to come to Kellynch?  I am glad I did not think of	106: 48, 6P  !
6P	it before.  How low it makes me|"	106: 48, 7P  !
6P	"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.	106: 48,10P  !
6P	She should put it off as long as she could."	106: 48,11P  !
6D	"We are expecting a brother of Mrs% Croft's here soon;	106: 49,26D  !
6D	I dare say you know him by name."	106: 49,27D  !
6P	"Oh, no| indeed, Charles, I cannot bear to have you go	107: 55,13P  !
6P	away.  Only think, if any thing should happen|"	107: 55,14P  !
6P	"So|  You and I are to be left to shift by ourselves,	107: 56, 4P  !
6P	with this poor sick child ~ and not a creature coming near	107: 56, 5P  !
6P	us all the evening|  I knew how it would be.  This is	107: 56, 6P  !
6P	always my luck|  If there is any thing disagreeable going	107: 56, 7P  !
6P	on, men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles is	107: 56, 8P  !
6P	as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling|  I must say it	107: 56, 9P  !
6P	is very unfeeling of him, to be running away from his	107: 56,10P  !
6P	poor little boy; talks of his being going on so well|	107: 56,11P  !
6P	How does he know that he is going on well, or that there	107: 56,12P  !
6P	may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?  I did	107: 56,13P  !
6P	not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So, here	107: 56,14P  !
6P	he is to go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the	107: 56,15P  !
6P	poor mother, I am not to be allowed to stir; ~ and yet,	107: 56,16P  !
6P	I am sure, I am more unfit than any body else to be about	107: 56,17P  !
6P	the child.  My being the mother is the very reason why	107: 56,18P  !
6P	my feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all equal	107: 56,19P  !
6P	to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday."	107: 56,20P  !
6A	"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your	107: 56,21A  !
6A	alarm ~ of the shock.  You will not be hysterical again.	107: 56,22A  !
6A	I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us.  I perfectly	107: 56,23A  !
6A	understand Mr% Robinson's directions, and have no fears;	107: 56,24A  !
6A	and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.	107: 56,25A  !
6A	Nursing does not belong to a man, it is not his province.	107: 56,26A  !
6A	A sick child is always the mother's property, her own	107: 56,27A  !
6A	feelings generally make it so."	107: 56,28A  !
6P	"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother ~ but	107: 56,29P  !
6P	I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick-room	107: 56,30P  !
6P	than Charles, for I cannot be always scolding and teazing	107: 56,31P  !
6P	a poor child when it is ill; and you saw, this morning,	107: 56,32P  !
6P	that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin	107: 56,33P  !
6P	kicking about.  I have not nerves for the sort of thing."	107: 56,34P  !
6A	"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending	107: 56,35A  !
6A	the whole evening away from the poor boy?"	107: 56,36A  !
6P	"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I? ~	107: 56,37P  !
6P	Jemima is so careful|  And she could send us word every	107: 56,38P  !
6P	hour how he was.  I really think Charles might as well	107: 57, 1P  !
6P	have told his father we would all come.  I am not more	107: 57, 2P  !
6P	alarmed about little Charles now than he is.  I was	107: 57, 3P  !
6P	dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very	107: 57, 4P  !
6P	different to-day."	107: 57, 5P  !
6A	"Well ~ if you do not think it too late to give notice	107: 57, 6A  !
6A	for yourself, suppose you were to go, as well as your	107: 57, 7A  !
6A	husband.  Leave little Charles to my care.  Mr% and	107: 57, 8A  !
6A	Mrs% Musgrove cannot think it wrong, while I remain	107: 57, 9A  !
6A	with him."	107: 57,10A  !
6P	"Are you serious?"	107: 57,11P  !
6P	"Dear me| that's a very good thought, very good	107: 57,12P  !
6P	indeed.  To be sure I may just as well go as not, for I am	107: 57,13P  !
6P	of no use at home ~ am I? and it only harasses me.  You,	107: 57,14P  !
6P	who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the	107: 57,15P  !
6P	properest person.  You can make little Charles do any thing;	107: 57,16P  !
6P	he always minds you at a word.  It will be a great	107: 57,17P  !
6P	deal better than leaving him with only Jemima.  Oh|	107: 57,18P  !
6P	I will certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as	107: 57,19P  !
6P	much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be	107: 57,20P  !
6P	acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know you do	107: 57,21P  !
6P	not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,	107: 57,22P  !
6P	indeed, Anne|  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready	107: 57,23P  !
6P	directly.  You can send for us, you know, at a moment's	107: 57,24P  !
6P	notice, if any thing is the matter; but I dare say there	107: 57,25P  !
6P	will be nothing to alarm you.  I should not go, you may	107: 57,26P  !
6P	be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear	107: 57,27P  !
6P	child."	107: 57,28P  !
6P	"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more	107: 57,33P  !

6P	for ever with the child, I should not be able to persuade	107: 57,35P  !
6P	him to do any thing he did not like.  Anne will stay;	107: 57,36P  !
6P	Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.	107: 57,37P  !
6P	It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you,	107: 57,38P  !
6P	which will be a great deal better, for I have not dined at	107: 58, 1P  !
6P	the other house since Tuesday."	107: 58, 2P  !

6P	"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne,	107: 60,30P  !
6P	though he was so attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him	107: 60,31P  !
6P	what he thought of you, when they went away; and he	107: 60,32P  !
6P	said,	107: 60,33P  !
6B	"You were so altered he should not have known	107: 60,33B  !

6B	match.  Any body between fifteen and thirty may have	107: 62, 4B  !
6B	me for asking.  A little beauty, and a few smiles, and	107: 62, 5B  !
6B	a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost man.	107: 62, 6B  !

6P	which the Musgroves have made, she has no right to	109: 76, 2P  !
6P	throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman	109: 76, 3P  !
6P	has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and	109: 76, 4P  !

6P	giving bad connections to those who have not been used	109: 76, 6P  !
6P	to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?  Nothing	109: 76, 7P  !

6P	Miss Musgrove, of Uppercross."	109: 76, 9P  !

6B	of life, she will cherish all her present powers of mind."	110: 88,24B  !
6B	"Do you mean that she refused him?"	110: 89, 2B  !
6B	"When did that happen?"	110: 89, 4B  !
6D	"He certainly means to have one or other of those	110: 92, 3D  !
6D	two girls, Sophy,"	110: 92, 4D  !
6D	"but there is no	110: 92, 4D  !
6D	saying which.  He has been running after them, too,	110: 92, 5D  !
6D	long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.  Ay,	110: 92, 6D  !
6D	this comes of the peace.  If it were war, now, he would	110: 92, 7D  !
6D	have settled it long ago. ~ We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot	110: 92, 8D  !
6D	afford to make long courtships in time of war.  How many	110: 92, 9D  !
6D	days was it, my dear, between the first time of my seeing	110: 92,10D  !
6D	you, and our sitting down together in our lodgings at	110: 92,11D  !
6D	North Yarmouth?"	110: 92,12D  !
6D	"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl;	110: 92,18D  !
6D	and what were we to wait for besides? ~ I do not like	110: 92,19D  !
6D	having such things so long in hand.  I wish Frederick	110: 92,20D  !
6D	would spread a little more canvas, and bring us home one	110: 92,21D  !
6D	of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then, there would	110: 92,22D  !
6D	always be company for them. ~ And very nice young	110: 92,23D  !
6D	ladies they both are; I hardly know one from the other."	110: 92,24D  !
6A	"And yet,"	111: 97,19A  !
6A	"he has not, perhaps, a more	111: 97,20A  !
6A	sorrowing heart than I have.  I cannot believe his	111: 97,21A  !
6A	prospects so blighted for ever.  He is younger than I am;	111: 97,22A  !
6A	younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man.	111: 97,23A  !
6A	He will rally again, and be happy with another."	111: 97,24A  !
6B	"Ah|"	112:105,18B  !
6B	"it is the very man we passed."	112:105,19B  !
6B	"Pray,"	112:105,24B  !
6B	"can	112:105,24B  !
6B	you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone	112:105,25B  !
6B	away?"	112:105,26B  !
6P	"Bless me|"	112:105,34P  !
6P	"it must be our cousin; ~	112:105,34P  !
6P	it must be our Mr% Elliot, it must, indeed| ~ Charles,	112:105,35P  !
6P	Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you see, just as our	112:105,36P  !
6P	Mr% Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary|  In the	112:105,37P  !
6P	very same inn with us|  Anne, must not it be our Mr% Elliot;	112:105,38P  !
6P	my father's next heir?  Pray Sir,"	112:106, 1P  !
6P	"did not you hear, ~ did not his servant say	112:106, 2P  !
6P	whether he belonged to the Kellynch family?"	112:106, 3P  !
6P	"There| you see|"	112:106, 7P  !
6P	"Just	112:106, 7P  !
6P	as I said|  Heir to Sir Walter Elliot| ~ I was sure that	112:106, 8P  !
6P	would come out, if it was so.  Depend upon it, that is	112:106, 9P  !
6P	a circumstance which his servants take care to publish	112:106,10P  !
6P	wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary|	112:106,11P  !
6P	I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we	112:106,12P  !
6P	had been aware in time, who it was, that he might have	112:106,13P  !
6P	been introduced to us.  What a pity that we should not	112:106,14P  !
6P	have been introduced to each other| ~ Do you think he	112:106,15P  !
6P	had the Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him,	112:106,16P  !
6P	I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something	112:106,17P  !
6P	of the Elliot countenance.  I wonder the arms did not	112:106,18P  !
6P	strike me|  Oh| ~ the great-coat was hanging over the	112:106,19P  !
6P	pannel, and hid the arms; so it did, otherwise, I am sure,	112:106,20P  !
6P	I should have observed them, and the livery too; if the	112:106,21P  !
6P	servant had not been in mourning, one should have known	112:106,22P  !
6P	him by the livery."	112:106,23P  !
6B	"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances	112:106,24B  !
6B	together,"	112:106,25B  !
6B	"we must consider	112:106,25B  !
6B	it to be the arrangement of Providence, that you should	112:106,26B  !
6B	not be introduced to your cousin."	112:106,27B  !
6P	"Of course,"	112:107, 6P  !
6P	"you will mention our seeing	112:107, 6P  !
6P	Mr% Elliot, the next time you write to Bath.  I think my	112:107, 7P  !
6P	father certainly ought to hear of it; do mention all about	112:107, 8P  !
6P	him."	112:107, 9P  !
6A	"No,"	112:108, 3A  !
6A	"that I can easily believe to be	112:108, 3A  !
6A	impossible; but in time, perhaps ~ we know what time	112:108, 4A  !
6A	does in every case of affliction, and you must remember,	112:108, 5A  !
6A	Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called	112:108, 6A  !
6A	a young mourner ~ Only last summer, I understand."	112:108, 7A  !
6A	"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon."	112:108, 9A  !
6P	"She is dead| she is dead|"	112:109,36P  !
6B	"Is there no one to help me?"	112:110, 5B  !
6A	"Go to him, go to him,"	112:110, 8A  !
6A	"for heaven's	112:110, 8A  !
6A	sake go to him.  I can support her myself.  Leave me,	112:110, 9A  !
6A	and go to him.  Rub her hands, rub her temples; here	112:110,10A  !
6A	are salts, ~ take them, take them."	112:110,11A  !
6B	"Oh God| her father and mother|"	112:110,19B  !
6A	"A surgeon|"	112:110,20A  !
6B	"True, true, a surgeon this instant,"	112:110,22B  !
6A	"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?	112:110,24A  !
6A	He knows where a surgeon is to be found."	112:110,25A  !
6A	"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am	112:111,10A  !
6A	sure, carry her gently to the inn."	112:111,11A  !
6B	"Yes, yes, to the inn,"	112:111,12B  !
6B	"I will carry her myself.  Musgrove, take care of the	112:111,14B  !
6B	others."	112:111,15B  !
6B	"Thank God|"	112:112,23B  !
6B	"We must be decided, and without the loss of another	112:113,30B  !
6B	minute.  Every minute is valuable.  Some must resolve	112:113,31B  !
6B	on being off for Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either	112:113,32B  !
6B	you or I must go."	112:113,33B  !
6B	"Then it is settled, Musgrove,"	112:114,12B  !
6B	"that you stay, and that I take care of your	112:114,13B  !
6B	sister home.  But as to the rest; ~ as to the others; ~	112:114,14B  !
6B	If one stays to assist Mrs% Harville, I think it need be	112:114,15B  !
6B	only one. ~ Mrs% Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish	112:114,16B  !
6B	to get back to her children; but, if Anne will stay, no	112:114,17B  !
6B	one so proper, so capable as Anne|"	112:114,18B  !
6B	"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse	112:114,22B  !
6B	her;"	112:114,23B  !
6A	"It was what she had been	112:114,27A  !
6A	thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do. ~ A bed on	112:114,28A  !
6A	the floor in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if	112:114,29A  !
6A	Mrs% Harville would but think so."	112:114,30A  !
6B	"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it,"	112:116,26B  !
6B	"Oh	112:116,26B  !
6B	God|  that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment|	112:116,27B  !
6B	Had I done as I ought|  But so eager and so resolute|	112:116,28B  !
6B	Dear, sweet Louisa|"	112:116,29B  !
6B	"I have been considering what we had best do.  She	112:117,13B  !
6B	must not appear at first.  She could not stand it.  I have	112:117,14B  !
6B	been thinking whether you had not better remain in the	112:117,15B  !
6B	carriage with her, while I go in and break it to Mr% and	112:117,16B  !
6B	Mrs% Musgrove.  Do you think this a good plan?"	112:117,17B  !
6A	"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the	201:125,22A  !
6A	two; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than	201:125,23A  !
6A	mine.  By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become	201:125,24A  !
6A	inured to it."	201:125,25A  !
6D	"Ay, a very bad business indeed. ~ A new sort of way	201:126,37D  !
6D	this, for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking	201:126,38D  !
6D	his mistress's head| ~ is not it, Miss Elliot? ~ This is	201:127, 1D  !
6D	breaking a head and giving a plaister truly|"	201:127, 2D  !
6D	"Now, this must be very bad for you,"	201:127, 6D  !
6D	"to be coming and	201:127, 7D  !
6D	finding us here. ~ I had not recollected it before, I declare,	201:127, 8D  !
6D	~ but it must be very bad. ~ But now, do not stand upon	201:127, 9D  !
6D	ceremony. ~ Get up and go over all the rooms in the	201:127,10D  !
6D	house if you like it."	201:127,11D  !
6A	"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now."	201:127,12A  !
6D	"Well, whenever it suits you. ~ You can slip in from	201:127,13D  !
6D	the shrubbery at any time.  And there you will find we	201:127,14D  !
6D	keep our umbrellas, hanging up by that door.  A good	201:127,15D  !
6D	place, is not it?  But"	201:127,16D  !
6D	"you will not	201:127,16D  !
6D	think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the	201:127,17D  !
6D	butler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.  One man's	201:127,18D  !
6D	ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our	201:127,19D  !
6D	own best.  And so you must judge for yourself, whether	201:127,20D  !
6D	it would be better for you to go about the house or not."	201:127,21D  !
6D	"We have made very few changes either|"	201:127,24D  !
6D	"Very few. ~ We	201:127,25D  !
6D	told you about the laundry-door, at Uppercross.  That	201:127,26D  !
6D	has been a very great improvement.  The wonder was,	201:127,27D  !
6D	how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience	201:127,28D  !
6D	of its opening as it did, so long| ~ You will tell	201:127,29D  !
6D	Sir Walter what we have done, and that Mr% Shepherd	201:127,30D  !
6D	thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had.	201:127,31D  !
6D	Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the	201:127,32D  !
6D	few alterations we have made have been all very much	201:127,33D  !
6D	for the better.  My wife should have the credit of them,	201:127,34D  !
6D	however.  I have done very little besides sending away	201:127,35D  !
6D	some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room,	201:127,36D  !
6D	which was your father's.  A very good man, and very	201:127,37D  !
6D	much the gentleman I am sure ~ but I should think, Miss Elliot"	201:127,38D  !
6D	"I should think	201:128, 1D  !
6D	he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life. ~	201:128, 2D  !
6D	Such a number of looking-glasses| oh Lord| there was	201:128, 3D  !
6D	no getting away from oneself.  So I got Sophy to lend	201:128, 4D  !
6D	me a hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now	201:128, 5D  !
6D	I am quite snug, with my little shaving glass in one	201:128, 6D  !
6D	corner, and another great thing that I never go near."	201:128, 7D  !
6D	"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,	201:128,11D  !
6D	pray give my compliments and Mrs% Croft's, and	201:128,12D  !
6D	say that we are settled here quite to our liking, and have	201:128,13D  !
6D	no fault at all to find with the place.  The breakfast-room	201:128,14D  !
6D	chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only	201:128,15D  !
6D	when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may	201:128,16D  !
6D	not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,	201:128,17D  !
6D	now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts	201:128,18D  !
6D	and can judge, there is not one that we like better	201:128,19D  !
6D	than this.  Pray say so, with my compliments.  He will	201:128,20D  !
6D	be glad to hear it."	201:128,21D  !
6P	"Oh|  Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he	202:130,11P  !
6P	is a very odd young man.  I do not know what he would	202:130,12P  !
6P	be at.  We asked him to come home with us for a day	202:130,13P  !
6P	or two; Charles undertook to give him some shooting,	202:130,14P  !
6P	and he seemed quite delighted, and for my part, I thought	202:130,15P  !
6P	it was all settled; when behold| on Tuesday night, he	202:130,16P  !
6P	made a very awkward sort of excuse; ""he never shot""	202:130,17P  !
6P	and he had ""been quite misunderstood,"" ~ and he had	202:130,18P  !
6P	promised this and he had promised that, and the end of	202:130,19P  !
6P	it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.  I suppose	202:130,20P  !
6P	he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word	202:130,21P  !
6P	I should have thought we were lively enough at the	202:130,22P  !
6P	Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick."	202:130,23P  !
6P	"I declare, Charles,	202:131, 4P  !
6P	I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time	202:131, 5P  !
6P	I was there.  I declare, Anne, he never talks of you	202:131, 6P  !
6P	at all."	202:131, 7P  !
6P	"And I am sure,"	202:131,21P  !
6P	"it was very	202:131,21P  !
6P	little to his credit, if he did.  Miss Harville only died last	202:131,22P  !
6P	June.  Such a heart is very little worth having; is it,	202:131,23P  !
6P	Lady Russell?  I am sure you will agree with me."	202:131,24P  !
6P	"Oh| as to being Anne's acquaintance,"	202:132, 3P  !
6P	"I think he is rather my acquaintance, for I have been	202:132, 4P  !
6P	seeing him every day this last fortnight."	202:132, 5P  !
6P	"You will not find any thing very agreeable in him,	202:132, 8P  !
6P	I assure you, ma'am.  He is one of the dullest young	202:132, 9P  !
6P	men that ever lived.  He has walked with me, sometimes,	202:132,10P  !
6P	from one end of the sands to the other, without saying	202:132,11P  !
6P	a word.  He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am	202:132,12P  !
6P	sure you will not like him."	202:132,13P  !
6A	"There we differ, Mary,"	202:132,14A  !
6A	"I think Lady Russell	202:132,14A  !
6A	would like him.  I think she would be so much	202:132,15A  !
6A	pleased with his mind, that she would very soon see no	202:132,16A  !
6A	deficiency in his manner."	202:132,17A  !
6P	"Yes, that he will|"	202:132,21P  !
6P	"He will sit poring over his book, and not know when	202:132,22P  !
6P	a person speaks to him, or when one drops one's scissors,	202:132,23P  !
6P	or any thing that happens.  Do you think Lady Russell	202:132,24P  !
6P	would like that?"	202:132,25P  !
6P	"You will not like him, I will answer for it."	202:132,35P  !
6A	"Oh| no, that must have been quite accidental.  In	203:142,21A  !
6A	general she has been in very good health, and very good	203:142,22A  !
6A	looks since Michaelmas."	203:142,23A  !
6A	"an accident,"	203:144,25A  !
6A	"No, nothing."	204:145,33A  !
6A	"No, nothing at all."	204:146, 1A  !
6A	"Elizabeth."	204:147,25A  !
6A	"My idea of good company, Mr% Elliot, is the company	204:150,16A  !
6A	of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of	204:150,17A  !
6A	conversation; that is what I call good company."	204:150,18A  !
6A	"Yes,"	204:150,37A  !
6A	"we shall, indeed, be known to	204:150,37A  !
6A	be related to them|" ~	204:150,38A  !
6A	"I certainly do think	204:151, 1A  !
6A	there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure	204:151, 2A  !
6A	the acquaintance.  I suppose	204:151, 3A  !
6A	I have more pride	204:151, 3A  !
6A	than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we	204:151, 4A  !
6A	should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged,	204:151, 5A  !
6A	which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect	204:151, 6A  !
6A	indifference to them."	204:151, 7A  !
6A	"Well,"	204:151,13A  !
6A	"I certainly am proud, too proud	204:151,13A  !
6A	to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place."	204:151,14A  !
6V	"And she,"	205:155, 8V  !
6V	"besides nursing me most admirably, has	205:155, 9V  !
6V	really proved an invaluable acquaintance. ~ As soon as	205:155,10V  !
6V	I could use my hands, she taught me to knit, which has	205:155,11V  !
6V	been a great amusement; and she put me in the way	205:155,12V  !
6V	of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks,	205:155,13V  !
6V	which you always find me so busy about, and which	205:155,14V  !
6V	supply me with the means of doing a little good to one	205:155,15V  !
6V	or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.  She has	205:155,16V  !
6V	a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among	205:155,17V  !
6V	those who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my	205:155,18V  !
6V	merchandize.  She always takes the right time for applying.	205:155,19V  !
6V	Every body's heart is open, you know, when they	205:155,20V  !
6V	have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering	205:155,21V  !
6V	the blessing of health, and nurse Rooke thoroughly understands	205:155,22V  !
6V	when to speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent,	205:155,23V  !
6V	sensible woman.  Hers is a line for seeing human nature;	205:155,24V  !
6V	and she has a fund of good sense and observation which,	205:155,25V  !
6V	as a companion, make her infinitely superior to thousands	205:155,26V  !
6V	of those who having only received ""the best education	205:155,27V  !

6V	gossip if you will; but when nurse Rooke has half an	205:155,29V  !
6V	hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something	205:155,30V  !
6V	to relate that is entertaining and profitable, something	205:155,31V  !
6V	that makes one know one's species better.  One	205:155,32V  !
6V	likes to hear what is going on, to be \au\ \fait\ as to the	205:155,33V  !
6V	newest modes of being trifling and silly.  To me, who live	205:155,34V  !
6V	so much alone, her conversation I assure you is a treat."	205:155,35V  !
6A	"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great	205:155,37A  !
6A	opportunities, and if they are intelligent may be well	205:155,38A  !
6A	worth listening to.  Such varieties of human nature as	205:156, 1A  !
6A	they are in the habit of witnessing|  And it is not merely	205:156, 2A  !
6A	in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it	205:156, 3A  !
6A	occasionally under every circumstance that can be most	205:156, 4A  !
6A	interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before	205:156, 5A  !
6A	them of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of	205:156, 6A  !
6A	heroism, fortitude, patience, resignation ~ of all the conflicts	205:156, 7A  !
6A	and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber	205:156, 8A  !
6A	may often furnish the worth of volumes."	205:156, 9A  !
6V	"Yes,"	205:156,10V  !
6V	"sometimes	205:156,10V  !
6V	it may, though I fear its lessons are not often in the	205:156,11V  !

6V	nature may be great in times of trial, but generally	205:156,13V  !
6V	speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that	205:156,14V  !
6V	appears in a sick chamber; it is selfishness and impatience	205:156,15V  !
6V	rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.	205:156,16V  !
6V	There is so little real friendship in the world| ~ and	205:156,17V  !
6V	unfortunately"	205:156,18V  !
6V	"there	205:156,18V  !
6V	are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost	205:156,19V  !
6V	too late."	205:156,20V  !
6V	"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs% Rooke	205:156,27V  !
6V	is in at present, will furnish much either to interest or	205:156,28V  !
6V	edify me. ~ She is only nursing Mrs% Wallis of Marlborough-buildings	205:156,29V  !
6V	~ a mere pretty, silly, expensive, fashionable	205:156,30V  !
6V	woman, I believe ~ and of course will have nothing to	205:156,31V  !
6V	report but of lace and finery. ~ I mean to make my profit	205:156,32V  !
6V	of Mrs% Wallis, however.  She has plenty of money, and	205:156,33V  !
6V	I intend she shall buy all the high-priced things I have	205:156,34V  !
6V	in hand now."	205:156,35V  !
6A	"She was	205:157, 9A  !
6A	engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow."	205:157,10A  !
6A	"No, Sir, she is not one and thirty; but I do not	205:157,28A  !
6A	think I can put off my engagement, because it is the only	205:157,29A  !
6A	evening for some time which will at once suit her and	205:157,30A  !
6A	myself. ~ She goes into the warm bath to-morrow, and for	205:157,31A  !
6A	the rest of the week you know we are engaged."	205:157,32A  !
6A	"She sees nothing to blame in it,"	205:157,35A  !
6A	"on	205:157,35A  !
6A	the contrary, she approves it; and has generally taken	205:157,36A  !
6A	me, when I have called on Mrs% Smith."	205:157,37A  !

6A	many respects I think highly of him,"	205:159,33A  !

6A	"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir."	206:162,18A  !
6P	"February 1st @@@@.	206:162,28P  !
6P	"MY DEAR ANNE,	206:162,29P  !
6P	"I make no apology for my silence, because I know	206:162,30P  !
6P	"how little people think of letters in such a place as	206:162,31P  !
6P	"Bath.  You must be a great deal too happy to care for	206:162,32P  !
6P	"Uppercross, which, as you well know, affords little to	206:162,33P  !
6P	"write about.  We have had a very dull Christmas;	206:162,34P  !
6P	"Mr% and Mrs% Musgrove have not had one dinner-party	206:163, 1P  !
6P	"all the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as any body.	206:163, 2P  !
6P	"The holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe	206:163, 3P  !
6P	"no children ever had such long ones.  I am sure I had	206:163, 4P  !
6P	"not.  The house was cleared yesterday, except of the	206:163, 5P  !
6P	"little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear that	206:163, 6P  !
6P	"they have never gone home.  Mrs% Harville must be an	206:163, 7P  !
6P	"odd mother to part with them so long.  I do not understand	206:163, 8P  !
6P	"it.  They are not at all nice children, in my	206:163, 9P  !
6P	"opinion; but Mrs% Musgrove seems to like them quite	206:163,10P  !
6P	"as well, if not better, than her grand-children.  What	206:163,11P  !
6P	"dreadful weather we have had|  It may not be felt in	206:163,12P  !
6P	"Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country	206:163,13P  !
6P	"it is of some consequence.  I have not had a creature	206:163,14P  !
6P	"call on me since the second week in January, except	206:163,15P  !
6P	"Charles Hayter, who has been calling much oftener than	206:163,16P  !
6P	"was welcome.  Between ourselves, I think it a great	206:163,17P  !
6P	"pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as	206:163,18P  !
6P	"Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.	206:163,19P  !
6P	"The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the	206:163,20P  !
6P	"Harvilles to-morrow.  We are not asked to dine with	206:163,21P  !
6P	"them, however, till the day after, Mrs% Musgrove is so	206:163,22P  !
6P	"afraid of her being fatigued by the journey, which is	206:163,23P  !
6P	"not very likely, considering the care that will be taken	206:163,24P  !
6P	"of her; and it would be much more convenient to me	206:163,25P  !
6P	"to dine there to-morrow.  I am glad you find Mr% Elliot	206:163,26P  !
6P	"so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him	206:163,27P  !
6P	"too; but I have my usual luck, I am always out of	206:163,28P  !
6P	"the way when any thing desirable is going on; always	206:163,29P  !
6P	"the last of my family to be noticed.  What an immense	206:163,30P  !
6P	"time Mrs% Clay has been staying with Elizabeth|  Does	206:163,31P  !
6P	"she never mean to go away?  But perhaps if she were	206:163,32P  !
6P	"to leave the room vacant we might not be invited.	206:163,33P  !
6P	"Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect	206:163,34P  !
6P	"my children to be asked, you know.  I can leave them	206:163,35P  !
6P	"at the Great House very well, for a month or six weeks.	206:163,36P  !
6P	"I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to	206:163,37P  !
6P	"Bath almost immediately; they think the admiral	206:163,38P  !
6P	"gouty.  Charles heard it quite by chance:  they have	206:164, 1P  !
6P	"not had the civility to give me any notice, or offer to	206:164, 2P  !
6P	"take any thing.  I do not think they improve at all as	206:164, 3P  !
6P	"neighbours.  We see nothing of them, and this is really	206:164, 4P  !
6P	"an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me in	206:164, 5P  !
6P	"love, and every thing proper.  Yours, affectionately,	206:164, 6P  !
6P	"MARY M@@@@."	206:164, 7P  !
6P	"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and	206:164, 9P  !
6P	"Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there	206:164,10P  !
6P	"is a bad sore-throat very much about.  I dare say	206:164,11P  !
6P	"I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are	206:164,12P  !
6P	"always worse than anybody's."	206:164,13P  !
6P	"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word	206:164,16P  !
6P	"how Louisa bore her journey, and now I am extremely	206:164,17P  !
6P	"glad I did, having a great deal to add.  In the first	206:164,18P  !
6P	"place, I had a note from Mrs% Croft yesterday, offering	206:164,19P  !
6P	"to convey any thing to you; a very kind, friendly note	206:164,20P  !
6P	"indeed, addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore	206:164,21P  !
6P	"be able to make my letter as long as I like.  The	206:164,22P  !
6P	"admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely hope	206:164,23P  !
6P	"Bath will do him all the good he wants.  I shall be	206:164,24P  !
6P	"truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood	206:164,25P  !
6P	"cannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now	206:164,26P  !
6P	"for Louisa.  I have something to communicate that will	206:164,27P  !
6P	"astonish you not a little.  She and the Harvilles came	206:164,28P  !
6P	"on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening we went	206:164,29P  !
6P	"to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised	206:164,30P  !
6P	"not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had	206:164,31P  !
6P	"been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you	206:164,32P  !
6P	"think was the reason?  Neither more nor less than his	206:164,33P  !
6P	"being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture	206:164,34P  !
6P	"to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr% Musgrove;	206:164,35P  !
6P	"for it was all settled between him and her before	206:164,36P  !
6P	"she came away, and he had written to her father by	206:164,37P  !
6P	"Captain Harville.  True, upon my honour.  Are not	206:164,38P  !
6P	"you astonished?  I shall be surprised at least if you	206:165, 1P  !
6P	"ever received a hint of it, for I never did.  Mrs% Musgrove	206:165, 2P  !
6P	"protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.	206:165, 3P  !
6P	"We are all very well pleased, however; for though it	206:165, 4P  !
6P	"is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth, it is	206:165, 5P  !
6P	"infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr% Musgrove	206:165, 6P  !
6P	"has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is	206:165, 7P  !
6P	"expected to-day.  Mrs% Harville says her husband feels	206:165, 8P  !
6P	"a good deal on his poor sister's account; but, however,	206:165, 9P  !
6P	"Louisa is a great favourite with both.  Indeed Mrs% Harville	206:165,10P  !
6P	"and I quite agree that we love her the better for	206:165,11P  !
6P	"having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth	206:165,12P  !
6P	"will say; but if you remember, I never	206:165,13P  !
6P	"thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see	206:165,14P  !
6P	"any thing of it.  And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's	206:165,15P  !
6P	"being supposed to be an admirer of yours.	206:165,16P  !
6P	"How Charles could take such a thing into his head was	206:165,17P  !
6P	"always incomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more	206:165,18P  !
6P	"agreeable now.  Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove;	206:165,19P  !
6P	"but a million times better than marrying	206:165,20P  !
6P	"among the Hayters."	206:165,21P  !
6A	"They come on the Admiral's account.  He is thought	206:165,37A  !
6A	to be gouty."	206:165,38A  !
6A	"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at	206:166, 4A  !
6A	Admiral Croft's time of life, and in his profession, he	206:166, 5A  !
6A	should not have many acquaintance in such a place as	206:166, 6A  !
6A	this."	206:166, 7A  !
6D	"Ha| is it you?  Thank you, thank you.	206:169, 9D  !
6D	This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,	206:169,10D  !
6D	staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without	206:169,11D  !
6D	stopping.  But what a thing here is, by way of a boat.	206:169,12D  !
6D	Do look at it.  Did you ever see the like?  What queer	206:169,13D  !
6D	fellows your fine painters must be, to think that any body	206:169,14D  !
6D	would venture their lives in such a shapeless old	206:169,15D  !
6D	cockleshell as that.  And yet, here are two gentlemen	206:169,16D  !
6D	stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about	206:169,17D  !
6D	them at the rocks and mountains, as if they were not to	206:169,18D  !
6D	be upset the next moment, which they certainly must be.	206:169,19D  !
6D	I wonder where that boat was built|"	206:169,20D  !
6D	"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.  Well,"	206:169,21D  !
6D	"now, where are you bound?  Can I go	206:169,22D  !
6D	any where for you, or with you?  Can I be of any use?"	206:169,23D  !
6A	"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the	206:169,24A  !
6A	pleasure of your company the little way our road lies	206:169,25A  !
6A	together.  I am going home."	206:169,26A  !
6D	"That I will, with all my heart, and farther too.  Yes,	206:169,27D  !
6D	yes, we will have a snug walk together; and I have	206:169,28D  !
6D	something to tell you as we go along.  There, take my	206:169,29D  !
6D	arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if I have	206:169,30D  !
6D	not a woman there.  Lord| what a boat it is|"	206:169,31D  !
6A	"Did you say that you had something to tell me,	206:169,33A  !
6A	sir?"	206:169,34A  !
6D	"Yes, I have.  Presently.  But here comes a friend,	206:169,35D  !
6D	Captain Brigden; I shall only say, ""How d'ye do,"" as	206:169,36D  !
6D	we pass, however.  I shall not stop.  ""How d'ye do.""	206:169,37D  !
6D	Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.	206:169,38D  !
6D	She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on	206:170, 1D  !
6D	one of her heels, as large as a three shilling piece.  If you	206:170, 2D  !
6D	look across the street, you will see Admiral Brand coming	206:170, 3D  !
6D	down and his brother.  Shabby fellows, both of them|	206:170, 4D  !
6D	I am glad they are not on this side of the way.  Sophy	206:170, 5D  !
6D	cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once ~	206:170, 6D  !
6D	got away some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole	206:170, 7D  !
6D	story another time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew	206:170, 8D  !
6D	and his grandson.  Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand	206:170, 9D  !
6D	to you; he takes you for my wife.  Ah| the peace has	206:170,10D  !
6D	come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald|	206:170,11D  !
6D	How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very	206:170,12D  !
6D	well.  We are always meeting with some old friend or	206:170,13D  !
6D	other; the streets full of them every morning; sure to	206:170,14D  !
6D	have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them	206:170,15D  !
6D	all, and shut ourselves into our lodgings, and draw in our	206:170,16D  !
6D	chairs, and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or	206:170,17D  !
6D	as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.  We	206:170,18D  !
6D	do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,	206:170,19D  !
6D	for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.	206:170,20D  !
6D	The wind blows through one of the cupboards	206:170,21D  !
6D	just in the same way."	206:170,22D  !
6D	"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise	206:170,32D  !
6D	you.  But first of all, you must tell me the name of the	206:170,33D  !
6D	young lady I am going to talk about.  That young lady,	206:170,34D  !
6D	you know, that we have all been so concerned for.  The	206:170,35D  !
6D	Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.  Her	206:170,36D  !
6D	christian name ~ I always forget her christian name."	206:170,37D  !
6A	"Louisa."	206:171, 2A  !
6D	"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.	206:171, 3D  !
6D	I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names.	206:171, 4D  !
6D	I should never be out, if they were all Sophys,	206:171, 5D  !
6D	or something of that sort.  Well, this Miss Louisa, we all	206:171, 6D  !
6D	thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.  He was	206:171, 7D  !
6D	courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,	206:171, 8D  !
6D	what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme	206:171, 9D  !
6D	came; then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must	206:171,10D  !
6D	wait till her brain was set to right.  But even then, there	206:171,11D  !
6D	was something odd in their way of going on.  Instead of	206:171,12D  !
6D	staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he	206:171,13D  !
6D	went off to see Edward.  When we came back from	206:171,14D  !
6D	Minehead, he was gone down to Edward's, and there he	206:171,15D  !
6D	has been ever since.  We have seen nothing of him since	206:171,16D  !
6D	November.  Even Sophy could not understand it.  But	206:171,17D  !
6D	now, the matter has taken the strangest turn of all; for	206:171,18D  !
6D	this young lady, this same Miss Musgrove, instead of	206:171,19D  !
6D	being to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.	206:171,20D  !
6D	You know James Benwick."	206:171,21D  !
6A	"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick."	206:171,22A  !
6D	"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they	206:171,24D  !
6D	are married already, for I do not know what they should	206:171,25D  !
6D	wait for."	206:171,26D  !
6A	"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young	206:171,27A  !
6A	man,"	206:171,28A  !
6A	"and I understand that he bears an	206:171,28A  !
6A	excellent character."	206:171,29A  !
6D	"Oh| yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against	206:171,30D  !
6D	James Benwick.  He is only a commander, it is true,	206:171,31D  !
6D	made last summer, and these are bad times for getting	206:171,32D  !
6D	on, but he has not another fault that I know of.  An	206:171,33D  !
6D	excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you, a very active,	206:171,34D  !
6D	zealous officer too, which is more than you would think	206:171,35D  !
6D	for, perhaps, for that soft sort of manner does not do	206:171,36D  !
6D	him justice."	206:171,37D  !
6A	"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir.  I should never	206:171,38A  !
6A	augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick's manners.	206:172, 1A  !
6A	I thought them particularly pleasing, and I will answer	206:172, 2A  !
6A	for it they would generally please."	206:172, 3A  !
6D	"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick	206:172, 4D  !
6D	is rather too piano for me, and though very	206:172, 5D  !
6D	likely it is all our partiality, Sophy and I cannot help	206:172, 6D  !
6D	thinking Frederick's manners better than his.  There is	206:172, 7D  !
6D	something about Frederick more to our taste."	206:172, 8D  !
6A	"I was not entering into any comparison of the two	206:172,14A  !
6A	friends,"	206:172,15A  !
6D	"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit	206:172,16D  !
6D	of gossip.  We have it from Frederick himself.  His sister	206:172,17D  !
6D	had a letter from him yesterday, in which he tells us of	206:172,18D  !
6D	it, and he had just had it in a letter from Harville, written	206:172,19D  !
6D	upon the spot, from Uppercross.  I fancy they are all at	206:172,20D  !
6D	Uppercross."	206:172,21D  !
6A	"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is	206:172,23A  !
6A	nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth's letter to	206:172,24A  !
6A	make you and Mrs% Croft particularly uneasy.  It did	206:172,25A  !
6A	certainly seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment	206:172,26A  !
6A	between him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it	206:172,27A  !
6A	may be understood to have worn out on each side equally,	206:172,28A  !
6A	and without violence.  I hope his letter does not breathe	206:172,29A  !
6A	the spirit of an ill-used man."	206:172,30A  !
6D	"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur	206:172,31D  !
6D	from beginning to end."	206:172,32D  !
6D	"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain;	206:172,34D  !
6D	he has too much spirit for that.  If the girl likes	206:172,35D  !
6D	another man better, it is very fit she should have him."	206:172,36D  !
6A	"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is	206:172,37A  !
6A	nothing in Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to	206:172,38A  !
6A	make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend,	206:173, 1A  !
6A	which might appear, you know, without its being absolutely	206:173, 2A  !
6A	said.  I should be very sorry that such a friendship	206:173, 3A  !
6A	as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should	206:173, 4A  !
6A	be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of	206:173, 5A  !
6A	this sort."	206:173, 6A  !
6D	"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at	206:173, 7D  !
6D	all of that nature in the letter.  He does not give the	206:173, 8D  !
6D	least fling at Benwick; does not so much as say, ""I	206:173, 9D  !
6D	wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for wondering	206:173,10D  !
6D	at it.""  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,	206:173,11D  !
6D	that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name)?	206:173,12D  !
6D	for himself.  He very handsomely hopes they will be	206:173,13D  !
6D	happy together, and there is nothing very unforgiving in	206:173,14D  !
6D	that, I think."	206:173,15D  !
6D	"Poor Frederick|"	206:173,21D  !
6D	"Now he must	206:173,21D  !
6D	begin all over again with somebody else.  I think we	206:173,22D  !
6D	must get him to Bath.  Sophy must write, and beg him	206:173,23D  !
6D	to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am	206:173,24D  !
6D	sure.  It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again,	206:173,25D  !
6D	for that other Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her	206:173,26D  !
6D	cousin, the young parson.  Do not you think, Miss Elliot,	206:173,27D  !
6D	we had better try to get him to Bath?"	206:173,28D  !
6A	"I am much obliged to you,"	207:176,36A  !
6A	"but	207:176,36A  !
6A	I am not going with them.  The carriage would not	207:176,37A  !
6A	accommodate so many.  I walk.  I prefer walking."	207:176,38A  !
6B	"But it rains."	207:177, 1B  !
6A	"Oh| very little.  Nothing that I regard."	207:177, 2A  !
6B	"Though I came only	207:177, 3B  !
6B	yesterday, I have equipped myself properly for Bath	207:177, 4B  !
6B	already, you see,"	207:177, 5B  !
6B	"I wish	207:177, 5B  !
6B	you would make use of it, if you are determined to walk;	207:177, 6B  !
6B	though, I think, it would be more prudent to let me get	207:177, 7B  !
6B	you a chair."	207:177, 8B  !
6A	"I am only waiting for	207:177,11A  !
6A	Mr% Elliot.  He will be here in a moment, I am sure."	207:177,12A  !
6A	"good morning to you,"	207:177,24A  !
6V	"By all means,"	207:180,24V  !
6V	"only tell me all about it,	207:180,24V  !
6V	when you do come.  Who is your party?"	207:180,25V  !
6V	"Well, I heartily wish your	207:180,28V  !
6V	concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if	207:180,29V  !
6V	you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that	207:180,30V  !
6V	I may not have many more visits from you."	207:180,31V  !
6A	"How do you do?"	208:181, 9A  !
6B	"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am	208:181,31B  !
6B	afraid you must have suffered from the shock, and the	208:181,32B  !
6B	more from its not overpowering you at the time."	208:181,33B  !
6B	"It was a frightful hour,"	208:182, 2B  !
6B	"a frightful day|"	208:182, 2B  !
6B	"The day has produced some effects	208:182, 5B  !
6B	however ~ has had some consequences which must be considered	208:182, 6B  !
6B	as the very reverse of frightful. ~ When you had	208:182, 7B  !
6B	the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be	208:182, 8B  !
6B	the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have	208:182, 9B  !
6B	little idea of his being eventually one of those most	208:182,10B  !
6B	concerned in her recovery."	208:182,11B  !
6A	"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears ~ I	208:182,12A  !
6A	should hope it would be a very happy match.  There are	208:182,13A  !
6A	on both sides good principles and good temper."	208:182,14A  !
6B	"Yes,"	208:182,15B  !
6B	"but	208:182,15B  !
6B	there I think ends the resemblance.  With all my soul	208:182,16B  !
6B	I wish them happy, and rejoice over every circumstance	208:182,17B  !
6B	in favour of it.  They have no difficulties to contend with	208:182,18B  !
6B	at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays. ~ The Musgroves	208:182,19B  !
6B	are behaving like themselves, most honourably	208:182,20B  !
6B	and kindly, only anxious with true parental hearts to	208:182,21B  !
6B	promote their daughter's comfort.  All this is much, very	208:182,22B  !
6B	much in favour of their happiness; more than perhaps ~"	208:182,23B  !
6B	"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too	208:182,29B  !
6B	great a disparity, and in a point no less essential than	208:182,30B  !
6B	mind. ~ I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable,	208:182,31B  !
6B	sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding;	208:182,32B  !
6B	but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man,	208:182,33B  !
6B	a reading man ~ and I confess that I do consider his	208:182,34B  !
6B	attaching himself to her, with some surprise.  Had it	208:182,35B  !
6B	been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her,	208:182,36B  !
6B	because he believed her to be preferring him, it would	208:182,37B  !
6B	have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose	208:182,38B  !
6B	it so.  It seems, on the contrary, to have been	208:183, 1B  !
6B	a perfectly spontaneous, untaught feeling on his side, and	208:183, 2B  !
6B	this surprises me.  A man like him, in his situation|	208:183, 3B  !
6B	With a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken|  Fanny Harville	208:183, 4B  !
6B	was a very superior creature; and his attachment	208:183, 5B  !
6B	to her was indeed attachment.  A man does not	208:183, 6B  !
6B	recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a	208:183, 7B  !
6B	woman| ~ He ought not ~ he does not."	208:183, 8B  !
6A	"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?"	208:183,22A  !
6B	"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's	208:183,23B  !
6B	doing well was quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply	208:183,24B  !
6B	concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace.  It had	208:183,25B  !
6B	been my doing ~ solely mine.  She would not have been	208:183,26B  !
6B	obstinate if I had not been weak.  The country round	208:183,27B  !
6B	Lyme is very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal; and	208:183,28B  !
6B	the more I saw, the more I found to admire."	208:183,29B  !
6A	"I should very much like to see Lyme again,"	208:183,30A  !
6B	"Indeed|  I should not have supposed that you could	208:183,32B  !
6B	have found any thing in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.	208:183,33B  !
6B	The horror and distress you were involved in ~ the stretch	208:183,34B  !
6B	of mind, the wear of spirits| ~ I should have thought	208:183,35B  !
6B	your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong	208:183,36B  !
6B	disgust."	208:183,37B  !
6A	"The last few hours were certainly very painful,"	208:183,38A  !
6A	"but when pain is over, the remembrance	208:184, 1A  !
6A	of it often becomes a pleasure.  One does not love a place	208:184, 2A  !
6A	the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been all	208:184, 3A  !
6A	suffering, nothing but suffering ~ which was by no means	208:184, 4A  !
6A	the case at Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress	208:184, 5A  !
6A	during the last two hours; and, previously, there had	208:184, 6A  !
6A	been a great deal of enjoyment.  So much novelty and	208:184, 7A  !
6A	beauty|  I have travelled so little, that every fresh place	208:184, 8A  !
6A	would be interesting to me ~ but there is real beauty at	208:184, 9A  !
6A	Lyme:  and in short"	208:184,10A  !
6A	"altogether my impressions of the place	208:184,11A  !
6A	are very agreeable."	208:184,12A  !
6A	"This,"	208:186,28A  !
6A	"is nearly the sense, or rather the	208:186,28A  !
6A	meaning of the words, for certainly the sense of an Italian	208:186,29A  !
6A	love-song must not be talked of, ~ but it is as nearly the	208:186,30A  !
6A	meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend to understand	208:186,31A  !
6A	the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar."	208:186,32A  !
6A	"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should	208:187, 1A  !
6A	be sorry to be examined by a real proficient."	208:187, 2A  !
6A	"For shame| for shame| ~ this is too much of flattery.	208:187, 9A  !
6A	I forget what we are to have next,"	208:187,10A  !
6A	"Indeed| ~ How so?  You can have been acquainted	208:187,14A  !
6A	with it only since I came to Bath, excepting as you might	208:187,15A  !
6A	hear me previously spoken of in my own family."	208:187,16A  !
6B	"He must wish her good night.	208:190,29B  !
6B	He was going ~ he should get home as fast as he could."	208:190,30B  !
6A	"Is not this song worth staying for?"	208:190,31A  !
6B	"No|"	208:190,34B  !
6B	"there is nothing	208:190,34B  !
6B	worth my staying for;"	208:190,35B  !
6V	"The little Durands were there, I conclude,"	209:193, 9V  !
6V	"with their mouths open to catch the music; like	209:193,10V  !
6V	unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.  They never miss	209:193,11V  !
6V	a concert."	209:193,12V  !
6A	"Yes.  I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr% Elliot	209:193,13A  !
6A	say they were in the room."	209:193,14A  !
6V	"The Ibbotsons ~ were they there? and the two new	209:193,15V  !
6V	beauties, with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for	209:193,16V  !
6V	one of them."	209:193,17V  !
6A	"I do not know. ~ I do not think they were."	209:193,18A  !
6V	"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.	209:193,19V  !
6V	She never misses, I know; and you must have seen	209:193,20V  !
6V	her.  She must have been in your own circle, for as you	209:193,21V  !
6V	went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of	209:193,22V  !
6V	grandeur; round the orchestra, of course."	209:193,23V  !
6A	"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been	209:193,24A  !
6A	very unpleasant to me in every respect.  But happily	209:193,25A  !
6A	Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off; and	209:193,26A  !
6A	we were exceedingly well placed ~ that is for hearing;	209:193,27A  !
6A	I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen	209:193,28A  !
6A	very little."	209:193,29A  !
6V	"Oh| you saw enough for your own amusement. ~	209:193,30V  !
6V	I can understand.  There is a sort of domestic enjoyment	209:193,31V  !
6V	to be known even in a crowd, and this you had.  You	209:193,32V  !
6V	were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing	209:193,33V  !
6V	beyond."	209:193,34V  !
6A	"But I ought to have looked about me more,"	209:193,35A  !
6V	"No, no ~ you were better employed.  You need not	209:194, 1V  !
6V	tell me that you had a pleasant evening.  I see it in your	209:194, 2V  !
6V	eye.  I perfectly see how the hours passed ~ that you had	209:194, 3V  !
6V	always something agreeable to listen to.  In the intervals	209:194, 4V  !
6V	of the concert, it was conversation."	209:194, 5V  !
6A	"Do you see that in my	209:194, 6A  !
6A	eye?"	209:194, 7A  !
6V	"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me	209:194, 8V  !
6V	that you were in company last night with the person,	209:194, 9V  !
6V	whom you think the most agreeable in the world, the	209:194,10V  !
6V	person who interests you at this present time, more than	209:194,11V  !
6V	all the rest of the world put together."	209:194,12V  !
6V	"And such being the case,"	209:194,15V  !
6V	"I hope you believe that I do know	209:194,16V  !
6V	how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning.	209:194,17V  !
6V	It is really very good of you to come and sit with me,	209:194,18V  !
6V	when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon	209:194,19V  !
6V	your time."	209:194,20V  !
6V	"Pray,"	209:194,26V  !
6V	"is Mr% Elliot aware of your	209:194,26V  !
6V	acquaintance with me?  Does he know that I am in Bath?"	209:194,27V  !
6A	"Mr% Elliot|"	209:194,28A  !
6A	"are you acquainted with Mr% Elliot?"	209:194,32A  !
6V	"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,"	209:194,33V  !
6V	"but it seems worn out now.  It is	209:194,34V  !
6V	a great while since we met."	209:194,35V  !
6A	"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned	209:194,36A  !
6A	it before.  Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure	209:194,37A  !
6A	of talking to him about you."	209:194,38A  !
6V	"To confess the truth,"	209:195, 1V  !
6V	"that is exactly the pleasure	209:195, 2V  !
6V	I want you to have.  I want you to talk about me to	209:195, 3V  !
6V	Mr% Elliot.  I want your interest with him.  He can be	209:195, 4V  !
6V	of essential service to me; and if you would have the	209:195, 5V  !
6V	goodness, my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to	209:195, 6V  !
6V	yourself, of course it is done."	209:195, 7V  !
6A	"I should be extremely happy ~ I hope you cannot	209:195, 8A  !
6A	doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to	209:195, 9A  !
6A	you,"	209:195,10A  !
6A	"but I suspect that you are considering	209:195,10A  !
6A	me as having a higher claim on Mr% Elliot ~	209:195,11A  !
6A	a greater right to influence him, than is really the case.	209:195,12A  !
6A	I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such	209:195,13A  !
6A	a notion.  You must consider me only as Mr% Elliot's	209:195,14A  !
6A	relation.  If in that light, if there is any thing which you	209:195,15A  !
6A	suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you	209:195,16A  !
6A	would not hesitate to employ me."	209:195,17A  !
6V	"I have been a little premature, I perceive.  I beg	209:195,20V  !
6V	your pardon.  I ought to have waited for official information.	209:195,21V  !
6V	But now, my dear Miss Elliot, as an old friend,	209:195,22V  !
6V	do give me a hint as to when I may speak.  Next week?	209:195,23V  !
6V	To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all	209:195,24V  !
6V	settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr% Elliot's	209:195,25V  !
6V	good fortune."	209:195,26V  !
6A	"No,"	209:195,27A  !
6A	"nor next week, nor next, nor	209:195,27A  !
6A	next.  I assure you that nothing of the sort you are	209:195,28A  !
6A	thinking of will be settled any week.  I am not going	209:195,29A  !
6A	to marry Mr% Elliot.  I should like to know why you	209:195,30A  !
6A	imagine I am."	209:195,31A  !
6V	"Now, how I do wish I understood you|  How I do	209:195,34V  !
6V	wish I knew what you were at|  I have a great idea that	209:195,35V  !
6V	you do not design to be cruel, when the right moment	209:195,36V  !
6V	comes.  Till it does come, you know, we women never	209:195,37V  !
6V	mean to have any body.  It is a thing of course among	209:195,38V  !
6V	us, that every man is refused ~ till he offers.  But why	209:196, 1V  !
6V	should you be cruel?  Let me plead for my ~ present	209:196, 2V  !
6V	friend I cannot call him ~ but for my former friend.	209:196, 3V  !
6V	Where can you look for a more suitable match?  Where	209:196, 4V  !
6V	could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?	209:196, 5V  !
6V	Let me recommend Mr% Elliot.  I am sure you hear	209:196, 6V  !
6V	nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who	209:196, 7V  !
6V	can know him better than Colonel Wallis?"	209:196, 8V  !
6A	"My dear Mrs% Smith, Mr% Elliot's wife has not been	209:196, 9A  !
6A	dead much above half a year.  He ought not to be	209:196,10A  !
6A	supposed to be paying his addresses to any one."	209:196,11A  !
6V	"Oh| if these are your only objections,"	209:196,12V  !
6V	"Mr% Elliot is safe, and I shall give	209:196,13V  !
6V	myself no more trouble about him.  Do not forget me	209:196,14V  !
6V	when you are married, that's all.  Let him know me to	209:196,15V  !
6V	be a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the	209:196,16V  !
6V	trouble required, which it is very natural for him now,	209:196,17V  !
6V	with so many affairs and engagements of his own, to	209:196,18V  !
6V	avoid and get rid of as he can ~ very natural, perhaps.	209:196,19V  !
6V	Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of	209:196,20V  !
6V	course, he cannot be aware of the importance to me.	209:196,21V  !
6V	Well, my dear Miss Elliot, I hope and trust you will be	209:196,22V  !
6V	very happy.  Mr% Elliot has sense to understand the value	209:196,23V  !
6V	of such a woman.  Your peace will not be shipwrecked	209:196,24V  !
6V	as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,	209:196,25V  !
6V	and safe in his character.  He will not be led astray, he	209:196,26V  !
6V	will not be misled by others to his ruin."	209:196,27V  !
6A	"No,"	209:196,28A  !
6A	"I can readily believe all that of	209:196,28A  !
6A	my cousin.  He seems to have a calm, decided temper,	209:196,29A  !
6A	not at all open to dangerous impressions.  I consider him	209:196,30A  !
6A	with great respect.  I have no reason, from any thing	209:196,31A  !
6A	that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.	209:196,32A  !
6A	But I have not known him long; and he is not a man,	209:196,33A  !
6A	I think, to be known intimately soon.  Will not this	209:196,34A  !
6A	manner of speaking of him, Mrs% Smith, convince you	209:196,35A  !
6A	that he is nothing to me?  Surely, this must be calm	209:196,36A  !
6A	enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.	209:196,37A  !
6A	Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little	209:196,38A  !
6A	reason to imagine he has any thought of doing), I shall	209:197, 1A  !
6A	not accept him.  I assure you I shall not.  I assure you	209:197, 2A  !
6A	Mr% Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing,	209:197, 3A  !
6A	in whatever pleasure the concert of last night	209:197, 4A  !
6A	might afford: ~ not Mr% Elliot; it is not Mr% Elliot	209:197, 5A  !
6A	that ~"	209:197, 6A  !
6A	"Do tell me how it first came into your head."	209:197,17A  !
6V	"It first came into my head,"	209:197,18V  !
6V	"upon finding how much you were together, and feeling	209:197,19V  !
6V	it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished	209:197,20V  !
6V	for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you	209:197,21V  !
6V	may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have	209:197,22V  !
6V	disposed of you in the same way.  But I never heard it	209:197,23V  !
6V	spoken of till two days ago."	209:197,24V  !
6A	"And has it indeed been spoken of?"	209:197,25A  !
6V	"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to	209:197,26V  !
6V	you, when you called yesterday?"	209:197,27V  !
6A	"No.  Was not it Mrs% Speed, as usual, or the maid?	209:197,28A  !
6A	I observed no one in particular."	209:197,29A  !
6V	"It was my friend, Mrs% Rooke ~ Nurse Rooke, who, by the by,	209:197,30V  !
6V	had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted	209:197,31V  !
6V	to be in the way to let you in.  She came away from	209:197,32V  !
6V	Marlborough-buildings only on Sunday; and she it was	209:197,33V  !
6V	who told me you were to marry Mr% Elliot.  She had had	209:197,34V  !
6V	it from Mrs% Wallis herself, which did not seem bad	209:197,35V  !
6V	authority.  She sat an hour with me on Monday evening,	209:197,36V  !
6V	and gave me the whole history."	209:197,37V  !
6A	"The whole history|"	209:197,38A  !
6A	"She	209:197,38A  !
6A	could not make a very long history, I think, of one such	209:198, 1A  !
6A	little article of unfounded news."	209:198, 2A  !
6A	"But,"	209:198, 4A  !
6A	"though there is	209:198, 4A  !
6A	no truth in my having this claim on Mr% Elliot, I should	209:198, 5A  !
6A	be extremely happy to be of use to you, in any way that	209:198, 6A  !
6A	I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?	209:198, 7A  !
6A	Shall I take any message?"	209:198, 8A  !
6V	"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth	209:198, 9V  !
6V	of the moment, and under a mistaken impression, I might,	209:198,10V  !
6V	perhaps, have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances.	209:198,11V  !
6V	But not now:  no, I thank you, I have	209:198,12V  !
6V	nothing to trouble you with."	209:198,13V  !
6A	"I think you spoke of having known Mr% Elliot many	209:198,14A  !
6A	years?"	209:198,15A  !
6V	"I did."	209:198,16V  !
6A	"Not before he married, I suppose?"	209:198,17A  !
6V	"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first."	209:198,18V  !
6A	"And ~ were you much acquainted?"	209:198,19A  !
6V	"Intimately."	209:198,20V  !
6A	"Indeed|  Then do tell me what he was at that time	209:198,21A  !
6A	of life.  I have a great curiosity to know what Mr% Elliot	209:198,22A  !
6A	was as a very young man.  Was he at all such as he	209:198,23A  !
6A	appears now?"	209:198,24A  !
6V	"I have not seen Mr% Elliot these three years,"	209:198,25V  !
6V	"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,"	209:198,30V  !
6V	"I beg your pardon for	209:198,31V  !
6V	the short answers I have been giving you, but I have	209:198,32V  !
6V	been uncertain what I ought to do.  I have been doubting	209:198,33V  !
6V	and considering as to what I ought to tell you.  There	209:198,34V  !
6V	were many things to be taken into the account.  One	209:198,35V  !
6V	hates to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making	209:198,36V  !
6V	mischief.  Even the smooth surface of family-union seems	209:198,37V  !
6V	worth preserving, though there may be nothing durable	209:198,38V  !
6V	beneath.  However, I have determined; I think I am	209:199, 1V  !
6V	right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with	209:199, 2V  !
6V	Mr% Elliot's real character.  Though I fully believe that,	209:199, 3V  !
6V	at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting	209:199, 4V  !
6V	him, there is no saying what may happen.  You	209:199, 5V  !
6V	might, some time or other, be differently affected towards	209:199, 6V  !
6V	him.  Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are	209:199, 7V  !
6V	unprejudiced.  Mr% Elliot is a man without heart or	209:199, 8V  !
6V	conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who	209:199, 9V  !
6V	thinks only of himself; who, for his own interest or ease,	209:199,10V  !
6V	would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery, that	209:199,11V  !
6V	could be perpetrated without risk of his general character.	209:199,12V  !
6V	He has no feeling for others.  Those whom he has been	209:199,13V  !
6V	the chief cause of leading into ruin, he can neglect and	209:199,14V  !
6V	desert without the smallest compunction.  He is totally	209:199,15V  !
6V	beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.	209:199,16V  !
6V	Oh| he is black at heart, hollow and black|"	209:199,17V  !
6V	"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an	209:199,20V  !
6V	injured, angry woman.  But I will try to command myself.	209:199,21V  !
6V	I will not abuse him.  I will only tell you what	209:199,22V  !
6V	I have found him.  Facts shall speak.  He was the	209:199,23V  !
6V	intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and	209:199,24V  !
6V	loved him, and thought him as good as himself.  The	209:199,25V  !
6V	intimacy had been formed before our marriage.  I found	209:199,26V  !
6V	them most intimate friends; and I, too, became excessively	209:199,27V  !
6V	pleased with Mr% Elliot, and entertained the highest	209:199,28V  !
6V	opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not	209:199,29V  !
6V	think very seriously, but Mr% Elliot appeared to me quite	209:199,30V  !
6V	as good as others, and much more agreeable than most	209:199,31V  !
6V	others, and we were almost always together.  We were	209:199,32V  !
6V	principally in town, living in very good style.  He was	209:199,33V  !
6V	then the inferior in circumstances, he was then the poor	209:199,34V  !
6V	one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as	209:199,35V  !
6V	much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman.	209:199,36V  !
6V	He had always a home with us whenever he chose	209:199,37V  !
6V	it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.  My	209:199,38V  !
6V	poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in	209:200, 1V  !
6V	the world, would have divided his last farthing with him;	209:200, 2V  !
6V	and I know that his purse was open to him; I know	209:200, 3V  !
6V	that he often assisted him."	209:200, 4V  !
6A	"This must have been about that very period of	209:200, 5A  !
6A	Mr% Elliot's life,"	209:200, 6A  !
6A	"which has always excited	209:200, 6A  !
6A	my particular curiosity.  It must have been about the	209:200, 7A  !
6A	same time that he became known to my father and sister.	209:200, 8A  !
6A	I never knew him myself, I only heard of him, but there	209:200, 9A  !
6A	was a something in his conduct then with regard to my	209:200,10A  !
6A	father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of	209:200,11A  !
6A	his marriage, which I never could quite reconcile with	209:200,12A  !
6A	present times.  It seemed to announce a different sort	209:200,13A  !
6A	of man."	209:200,14A  !
6V	"I know it all, I know it all,"	209:200,15V  !
6V	"He	209:200,15V  !
6V	had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before	209:200,16V  !
6V	I was acquainted with him, but I heard him speak of	209:200,17V  !
6V	them for ever.  I know he was invited and encouraged,	209:200,18V  !
6V	and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,	209:200,19V  !
6V	perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and	209:200,20V  !
6V	as to his marriage, I knew all about it at the time.  I was	209:200,21V  !
6V	privy to all the fors and againsts, I was the friend to	209:200,22V  !
6V	whom he confided his hopes and plans, and though I did	209:200,23V  !
6V	not know his wife previously, (her inferior situation in	209:200,24V  !
6V	society, indeed, rendered that impossible) yet I knew her	209:200,25V  !
6V	all her life afterwards, or, at least, till within the last	209:200,26V  !
6V	two years of her life, and can answer any question you	209:200,27V  !
6V	wish to put."	209:200,28V  !
6A	"Nay,"	209:200,29A  !
6A	"I have no particular enquiry to	209:200,29A  !
6A	make about her.  I have always understood they were	209:200,30A  !
6A	not a happy couple.  But I should like to know why, at	209:200,31A  !
6A	that time of his life, he should slight my father's acquaintance	209:200,32A  !
6A	as he did.  My father was certainly disposed to	209:200,33A  !
6A	take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did	209:200,34A  !
6A	Mr% Elliot draw back?"	209:200,35A  !
6V	"Mr% Elliot,"	209:200,36V  !
6V	"at that period of	209:200,36V  !
6V	his life, had one object in view ~ to make his fortune, and	209:200,37V  !
6V	by a rather quicker process than the law.  He was determined	209:200,38V  !
6V	to make it by marriage.  He was determined, at	209:201, 1V  !
6V	least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and	209:201, 2V  !
6V	I know it was his belief, (whether justly or not, of course	209:201, 3V  !
6V	I cannot decide) that your father and sister, in their	209:201, 4V  !
6V	civilities and invitations, were designing a match between	209:201, 5V  !
6V	the heir and the young lady; and it was impossible that	209:201, 6V  !
6V	such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth	209:201, 7V  !
6V	and independance.  That was his motive for drawing	209:201, 8V  !
6V	back, I can assure you.  He told me the whole story.	209:201, 9V  !
6V	He had no concealments with me.  It was curious, that	209:201,10V  !
6V	having just left you behind me in Bath, my first and	209:201,11V  !
6V	principal acquaintance on marrying, should be your	209:201,12V  !
6V	cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually	209:201,13V  !
6V	hearing of your father and sister.  He described one	209:201,14V  !
6V	Miss Elliot, and I thought very affectionately of the	209:201,15V  !
6V	other."	209:201,16V  !
6A	"Perhaps,"	209:201,17A  !
6A	"you	209:201,17A  !
6A	sometimes spoke of me to Mr% Elliot?"	209:201,18A  !
6V	"To be sure I did, very often.  I used to boast of my	209:201,19V  !
6V	own Anne Elliot, and vouch for your being a very different	209:201,20V  !
6V	creature from ~"	209:201,21V  !
6A	"This accounts for something which Mr% Elliot said	209:201,23A  !
6A	last night,"	209:201,24A  !
6A	"This explains it.  I found he	209:201,24A  !
6A	had been used to hear of me.  I could not comprehend	209:201,25A  !
6A	how.  What wild imaginations one forms, where dear self	209:201,26A  !
6A	is concerned|  How sure to be mistaken|  But I beg	209:201,27A  !
6A	your pardon; I have interrupted you.  Mr% Elliot married,	209:201,28A  !
6A	then, completely for money?  The circumstance, probably,	209:201,29A  !
6A	which first opened your eyes to his character."	209:201,30A  !
6V	"Oh| those things	209:201,31V  !
6V	are too common.  When one lives in the world, a man	209:201,32V  !
6V	or woman's marrying for money is too common to strike	209:201,33V  !
6V	one as it ought.  I was very young, and associated only	209:201,34V  !
6V	with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set,	209:201,35V  !
6V	without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.	209:201,36V  !
6V	I think differently now; time and sickness, and	209:201,37V  !
6V	sorrow, have given me other notions; but, at that period,	209:201,38V  !
6V	I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr% Elliot	209:202, 1V  !
6V	was doing.  ""To do the best for himself,"" passed as	209:202, 2V  !
6V	a duty."	209:202, 3V  !
6A	"But was not she a very low woman?"	209:202, 4A  !
6V	"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.	209:202, 5V  !
6V	Money, money, was all that he wanted.  Her father was	209:202, 6V  !
6V	a grazier, her grandfather had been a butcher, but that	209:202, 7V  !
6V	was all nothing.  She was a fine woman, had had a decent	209:202, 8V  !
6V	education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown	209:202, 9V  !
6V	by chance into Mr% Elliot's company, and fell in love	209:202,10V  !
6V	with him; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there	209:202,11V  !
6V	on his side, with respect to her birth.  All his caution	209:202,12V  !
6V	was spent in being secured of the real amount of her	209:202,13V  !
6V	fortune, before he committed himself.  Depend upon it,	209:202,14V  !
6V	whatever esteem Mr% Elliot may have for his own situation	209:202,15V  !
6V	in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest	209:202,16V  !
6V	value for it.  His chance of the Kellynch estate was	209:202,17V  !
6V	something, but all the honour of the family he held as	209:202,18V  !
6V	cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare, that if	209:202,19V  !
6V	baronetcies were saleable, any body should have his for	209:202,20V  !
6V	fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;	209:202,21V  !
6V	but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear	209:202,22V  !
6V	him say on that subject.  It would not be fair.  And yet	209:202,23V  !
6V	you ought to have proof; for what is all this but assertion?	209:202,24V  !
6V	and you shall have proof."	209:202,25V  !
6A	"Indeed, my dear Mrs% Smith, I want none,"	209:202,26A  !
6A	"You have asserted nothing contradictory to	209:202,27A  !
6A	what Mr% Elliot appeared to be some years ago.  This is	209:202,28A  !
6A	all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and	209:202,29A  !
6A	believe.  I am more curious to know why he should be	209:202,30A  !
6A	so different now?"	209:202,31A  !
6V	"But for my satisfaction; if you will have the goodness	209:202,32V  !
6V	to ring for Mary ~ stay, I am sure you will have the	209:202,33V  !
6V	still greater goodness of going yourself into my bed-room,	209:202,34V  !
6V	and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find	209:202,35V  !
6V	on the upper shelf of the closet."	209:202,36V  !
6V	"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband,	209:203, 3V  !
6V	a small portion only of what I had to look over when	209:203, 4V  !
6V	I lost him.  The letter I am looking for, was one written	209:203, 5V  !
6V	by Mr% Elliot to him before our marriage, and happened	209:203, 6V  !
6V	to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.  But he was	209:203, 7V  !
6V	careless and immethodical, like other men, about those	209:203, 8V  !
6V	things; and when I came to examine his papers, I found	209:203, 9V  !
6V	it with others still more trivial from different people	209:203,10V  !
6V	scattered here and there, while many letters and memorandums	209:203,11V  !
6V	of real importance had been destroyed.  Here it	209:203,12V  !
6V	is.  I would not burn it, because being even then very	209:203,13V  !
6V	little satisfied with Mr% Elliot, I was determined to preserve	209:203,14V  !
6V	every document of former intimacy.  I have now	209:203,15V  !
6V	another motive for being glad that I can produce it."	209:203,16V  !
6V	"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though	209:204, 9V  !
6V	I have forgot the exact terms, I have a perfect impression	209:204,10V  !
6V	of the general meaning.  But it shews you the man.	209;204,11V  !
6V	Mark his professions to my poor husband.  Can any thing	209:204,12V  !
6V	be stronger?"	209:204,13V  !
6A	"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly, proof of	209:204,22A  !
6A	every thing you were saying.  But why be acquainted	209:204,23A  !
6A	with us now?"	209:204,24A  !
6V	"I can explain this too,"	209:204,25V  !
6A	"Can you really?"	209:204,26A  !
6V	"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr% Elliot, as he was a dozen	209:204,27V  !
6V	years ago, and I will shew him as he is now.  I cannot	209:204,28V  !
6V	produce written proof again, but I can give as authentic	209:204,29V  !
6V	oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is now	209:204,30V  !
6V	wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite	209:204,31V  !
6V	now.  He truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions	209:204,32V  !
6V	to your family are very sincere, quite from the heart.	209:204,33V  !
6V	I will give you my authority; his friend Colonel Wallis."	209:204,34V  !
6A	"Colonel Wallis| are you acquainted with him?"	209:204,35A  !
6V	"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line	209:204,36V  !
6V	as that; it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.	209:204,37V  !
6V	The stream is as good as at first; the little	209:204,38V  !
6V	rubbish it collects in the turnings, is easily moved away.	209:205, 1V  !
6V	Mr% Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his	209:205, 2V  !
6V	views on you ~ which said Colonel Wallis I imagine to be	209:205, 3V  !
6V	in himself a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;	209:205, 4V  !
6V	but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom	209:205, 5V  !
6V	he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats	209:205, 6V  !
6V	it all to her.  She, in the overflowing spirits of her	209:205, 7V  !
6V	recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse,	209:205, 8V  !
6V	knowing my acquaintance with you, very naturally brings	209:205, 9V  !
6V	it all to me.  On Monday evening my good friend	209:205,10V  !
6V	Mrs% Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough-buildings.	209:205,11V  !
6V	When I talked of a whole history	209:205,12V  !
6V	therefore, you see, I was not romancing so much as you	209:205,13V  !
6V	supposed."	209:205,14V  !
6A	"My dear Mrs% Smith, your authority is deficient.  This	209:205,15A  !
6A	will not do.  Mr% Elliot's having any views on me will	209:205,16A  !
6A	not in the least account for the efforts he made towards	209:205,17A  !
6A	a reconciliation with my father.  That was all prior to	209:205,18A  !
6A	my coming to Bath.  I found them on the most friendly	209:205,19A  !
6A	terms when I arrived."	209:205,20A  !
6V	"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but" ~	209:205,21V  !
6A	"Indeed, Mrs% Smith, we must not expect to get real	209:205,22A  !
6A	information in such a line.  Facts or opinions which are	209:205,23A  !
6A	to pass through the hands of so many, to be misconceived	209:205,24A  !
6A	by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can hardly	209:205,25A  !
6A	have much truth left."	209:205,26A  !
6V	"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to	209:205,27V  !
6V	judge of the general credit due, by listening to some	209:205,28V  !
6V	particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict	209:205,29V  !
6V	or confirm.  Nobody supposes that you were his first	209:205,30V  !
6V	inducement.  He had seen you indeed, before he came	209:205,31V  !
6V	to Bath and admired you, but without knowing it to be	209:205,32V  !
6V	you.  So says my historian at least.  Is this true?  Did	209:205,33V  !
6V	he see you last summer or autumn, ""somewhere down in	209:205,34V  !
6V	the west,"" to use her own words, without knowing it to	209:205,35V  !
6V	be you?"	209:205,36V  !
6A	"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme;	209:205,37A  !
6A	I happened to be at Lyme."	209:205,38A  !
6V	"Well,"	209:206, 1V  !
6V	"grant	209:206, 1V  !
6V	my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first	209:206, 2V  !
6V	point asserted.  He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you	209:206, 3V  !
6V	so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you	209:206, 4V  !
6V	again in Camden-place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from	209:206, 5V  !
6V	that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in	209:206, 6V  !
6V	his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier;	209:206, 7V  !
6V	which I will now explain.  If there is any thing in my	209:206, 8V  !
6V	story which you know to be either false or improbable,	209:206, 9V  !
6V	stop me.  My account states, that your sister's friend,	209:206,10V  !
6V	the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you	209:206,11V  !
6V	mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter	209:206,12V  !
6V	as long ago as September, (in short when they first came	209:206,13V  !
6V	themselves) and has been staying there ever since; that	209:206,14V  !
6V	she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and	209:206,15V  !
6V	plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner,	209:206,16V  !
6V	as to give a general idea among Sir Walter's acquaintance,	209:206,17V  !
6V	of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise	209:206,18V  !
6V	that Miss Elliot should be apparently blind to the	209:206,19V  !
6V	danger."	209:206,20V  !
6V	"This was the light in which it appeared to those who	209:206,23V  !
6V	knew the family, long before your return to it; and	209:206,24V  !
6V	Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to	209:206,25V  !
6V	be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden-place;	209:206,26V  !
6V	but his regard for Mr% Elliot gave him an interest	209:206,27V  !
6V	in watching all that was going on there, and when	209:206,28V  !
6V	Mr% Elliot came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened	209:206,29V  !
6V	to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him	209:206,30V  !
6V	acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports	209:206,31V  !
6V	beginning to prevail. ~ Now you are to understand that	209:206,32V  !
6V	time had worked a very material change in Mr% Elliot's	209:206:33V  !
6V	opinions as to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points	209:206,34V  !
6V	of blood and connexion, he is a completely altered man.	209:206,35V  !
6V	Having long had as much money as he could spend,	209:206,36V  !
6V	nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence,	209:206,37V  !
6V	he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon	209:206,38V  !
6V	the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on,	209:207, 1V  !
6V	before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed	209:207, 2V  !
6V	feeling.  He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.	209:207, 3V  !
6V	You may guess therefore that the news he heard from	209:207, 4V  !
6V	his friend, could not be very agreeable, and you may	209:207, 5V  !
6V	guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back	209:207, 6V  !
6V	to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here	209:207, 7V  !
6V	for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance	209:207, 8V  !
6V	and recovering such a footing in the family, as	209:207, 9V  !
6V	might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of	209:207,10V  !
6V	his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it	209:207,11V  !
6V	material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends,	209:207,12V  !
6V	as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was	209:207,13V  !
6V	to assist in every way that he could.  He was to be	209:207,14V  !
6V	introduced, and Mrs% Wallis was to be introduced, and	209:207,15V  !
6V	every body was to be introduced.  Mr% Elliot came back	209:207,16V  !
6V	accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you	209:207,17V  !
6V	know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was	209:207,18V  !
6V	his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival	209:207,19V  !
6V	added another motive) to watch Sir Walter and Mrs% Clay.	209:207,20V  !
6V	He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw	209:207,21V  !
6V	himself in their way, called at all hours ~ but I need not	209:207,22V  !
6V	be particular on this subject.  You can imagine what an	209:207,23V  !
6V	artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may	209:207,24V  !
6V	recollect what you have seen him do."	209:207,25V  !
6A	"Yes,"	209:207,26A  !
6A	"you tell me nothing which does	209:207,26A  !
6A	not accord with what I have known, or could imagine.	209:207,27A  !
6A	There is always something offensive in the details of	209:207,28A  !
6A	cunning.  The mano euvres of selfishness and duplicity	209:207,29A  !
6A	must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which	209:207,30A  !
6A	really surprises me.  I know those who would be shocked	209:207,31A  !
6A	by such a representation of Mr% Elliot, who would have	209:207,32A  !
6A	difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.	209:207,33A  !
6A	I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct	209:207,34A  !
6A	than appeared. ~ I should like to know his present opinion,	209:207,35A  !
6A	as to the probability of the event he has been in dread	209:207,36A  !
6A	of; whether he considers the danger to be lessening	209:207,37A  !
6A	or not."	209:207,38A  !
6V	"Lessening, I understand,"	209:208, 1V  !
6V	"He	209:208, 1V  !
6V	thinks Mrs% Clay afraid of him, aware that he sees through	209:208, 2V  !
6V	her, and not daring to proceed as she might do in his	209:208, 3V  !
6V	absence.  But since he must be absent some time or	209:208, 4V  !
6V	other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure, while	209:208, 5V  !
6V	she holds her present influence.  Mrs% Wallis has an	209:208, 6V  !
6V	amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into	209:208, 7V  !
6V	the marriage articles when you and Mr% Elliot marry,	209:208, 8V  !
6V	that your father is not to marry Mrs% Clay.  A scheme,	209:208, 9V  !
6V	worthy of Mrs% Wallis's understanding, by all accounts;	209:208,10V  !
6V	but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it. ~	209:208,11V  !
6V	""Why, to be sure ma'am,"" said she, ""it would not	209:208,12V  !
6V	prevent his marrying any body else.""  And indeed, to	209:208,13V  !
6V	own the truth, I do not think nurse in her heart is a very	209:208,14V  !
6V	strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.	209:208,15V  !
6V	She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you	209:208,16V  !
6V	know, and (since self will intrude) who can say that she	209:208,17V  !
6V	may not have some flying visions of attending the next	209:208,18V  !
6V	Lady Elliot, through Mrs% Wallis's recommendation?"	209:208,19V  !
6A	"I am very glad to know all this,"	209:208,20A  !
6A	"It will be more painful to me	209:208,21A  !
6A	in some respects to be in company with him, but I shall	209:208,22A  !
6A	know better what to do.  My line of conduct will be more	209:208,23A  !
6A	direct.  Mr% Elliot is evidently a disingenuous, artificial,	209:208,24A  !
6A	worldly man, who has never had any better principle to	209:208,25A  !
6A	guide him than selfishness."	209;208,26A  !
6A	"She had seemed to recommend and	209:211,11A  !
6A	praise him|"	209:211,12A  !
6V	"My dear,"	209:211,13V  !
6V	"there was nothing	209:211,13V  !
6V	else to be done.  I considered your marrying him as	209:211,14V  !
6V	certain, though he might not yet have made the offer,	209:211,15V  !
6V	and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he	209:211,16V  !
6V	had been your husband.  My heart bled for you, as	209:211,17V  !
6V	I talked of happiness.  And yet, he is sensible, he is	209:211,18V  !
6V	agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not	209:211,19V  !
6V	absolutely hopeless.  He was very unkind to his first	209:211,20V  !
6V	wife.  They were wretched together.  But she was too	209:211,21V  !
6V	ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved	209:211,22V  !
6V	her.  I was willing to hope that you must fare better."	209:211,23V  !
6A	"I am extremely glad, indeed,"	210:217,34A  !
6A	"particularly	210:217,34A  !
6A	glad that this should happen:  and that of two	210:217,35A  !
6A	sisters, who both deserve equally well, and who have	210:217,36A  !
6A	always been such good friends, the pleasant prospects of	210:217,37A  !
6A	one should not be dimming those of the other ~ that they	210:217,38A  !
6A	should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.  I hope	210:218, 1A  !
6A	your father and mother are quite happy with regard to	210:218, 2A  !
6A	both."	210:218, 3A  !
6A	"Such excellent parents as Mr% and Mrs% Musgrove,"	210:218,18A  !
6A	"should be happy in their children's	210:218,19A  !
6A	marriages.  They do every thing to confer happiness,	210:218,20A  !
6A	I am sure.  What a blessing to young people to be in	210:218,21A  !
6A	such hands|  Your father and mother seem so totally	210:218,22A  !
6A	free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to	210:218,23A  !
6A	so much misconduct and misery, both in young and old|	210:218,24A  !
6A	I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now?"	210:218,25A  !
6A	"That cannot be much	210:218,33A  !
6A	to your taste, I know,"	210:218,34A  !
6A	"but I do believe him	210:218,34A  !
6A	to be an excellent young man."	210:218,35A  !
6P	"Anne,"	210:222, 4P  !
6P	"there is	210:222, 4P  !
6P	Mrs% Clay, I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and	210:222, 5P  !
6P	a gentleman with her.  I saw them turn the corner from	210:222, 6P  !
6P	Bath-street just now.  They seem deep in talk.  Who is	210:222, 7P  !
6P	it? ~ Come, and tell me.  Good heavens|  I recollect. ~	210:222, 8P  !
6P	It is Mr% Elliot himself."	210:222, 9P  !
6A	"No,"	210:222,10A  !
6A	"it cannot be Mr% Elliot,	210:222,10A  !
6A	I assure you.  He was to leave Bath at nine this morning,	210:222,11A  !
6A	and does not come back till to-morrow."	210:222,12A  !
6P	"Do come, Anne,"	210:222,29P  !
6P	"come and look yourself.	210:222,29P  !
6P	You will be too late, if you do not make haste.	210:222,30P  !
6P	They are parting, they are shaking hands.  He is turning	210:222,31P  !
6P	away.  Not know Mr% Elliot, indeed| ~ You seem to have	210:222,32P  !
6P	forgot all about Lyme."	210:222,33P  !
6A	"Yes, it is Mr% Elliot certainly.  He has changed his	210:223, 4A  !
6A	hour of going, I suppose, that is all ~ or I may be mistaken;	210:223, 5A  !
6A	I might not attend;"	210:223, 6A  !
6P	"Good heavens, Charles| how can you think of such	210:223,23P  !
6P	a thing?  Take a box for to-morrow night|  Have you	210:223,24P  !
6P	forgot that we are engaged to Camden-place to-morrow	210:223,25P  !
6P	night? and that we were most particularly asked on	210:223,26P  !
6P	purpose to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and	210:223,27P  !
6P	Mr% Elliot ~ all the principal family connexions ~ on purpose	210:223,28P  !
6P	to be introduced to them?  How can you be so	210:223,29P  !
6P	forgetful?"	210:223,30P  !

6P	you do| when you promised to go."	210:223,36P  !
6P	"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable	210:224, 1P  !
6P	to fail.  We were asked on purpose to be introduced.	210:224, 2P  !
6P	There was always such a great connexion between the	210:224, 3P  !
6P	Dalrymples and ourselves.  Nothing ever happened on	210:224, 4P  !
6P	either side that was not announced immediately.  We	210:224, 5P  !
6P	are quite near relations, you know:  and Mr% Elliot too,	210:224, 6P  !
6P	whom you ought to particularly to be acquainted with|	210:224, 7P  !
6P	Every attention is due to Mr% Elliot.  Consider, my	210:224, 8P  !

6A	"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the	210:224,35A  !
6A	party at home (excepting on Mary's account) would not	210:224,36A  !
6A	be the smallest impediment.  I have no pleasure in the	210:224,37A  !
6A	sort of meeting, and should be too happy to change it	210:224,38A  !
6A	for a play, and with you.  But, it had better not be	210:225, 1A  !
6A	attempted, perhaps."	210:225, 2A  !
6B	"You have not been long enough in Bath,"	210:225,14B  !
6B	"to enjoy the evening parties of the place."	210:225,15B  !
6A	"Oh| no.  The usual character of them has nothing	210:225,16A  !
6A	for me.  I am no card-player."	210:225,17A  !
6B	"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use	210:225,18B  !
6B	to like cards; but time makes many changes."	210:225,19B  !
6A	"I am not yet so much changed,"	210:225,20A  !
6B	"It is a period, indeed|	210:225,23B  !
6B	Eight years and a half is a period|"	210:225,24B  !
6P	"Only think of Elizabeth's including every body|"	210:227, 6P  !
6P	"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth	210:227, 7P  !
6P	is delighted|  You see he cannot put the card	210:227, 8P  !
6P	out of his hand."	210:227, 9P  !
6B	"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville,	211:229,31B  !
6B	now, if you will give me materials."	211:229,32B  !
6A	"Certainly, Captain Benwick."	211:232, 7A  !
6A	"No,"	211:232,23A  !
6A	"That,	211:232,23A  !
6A	I can easily believe."	211:232,24A  !
6A	"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly	211:232,26A  !
6A	loved."	211:232,27A  !
6A	"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you, so	211:232,30A  !
6A	soon as you forget us.  It is, perhaps, our fate rather	211:232,31A  !
6A	than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.  We live at	211:232,32A  !
6A	home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.	211:232,33A  !
6A	You are forced on exertion.  You have always a profession,	211:232,34A  !
6A	pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you	211:232,35A  !
6A	back into the world immediately, and continual occupation	211:232,36A  !
6A	and change soon weaken impressions."	211:232,37A  !
6A	"True,"	211:233, 6A  !
6A	"very true; I did not recollect;	211:233, 6A  !
6A	but what shall we say now, Captain Harville?  If the	211:233, 7A  !
6A	change be not from outward circumstances, it must be	211:233, 8A  !
6A	from within; it must be nature, man's nature, which has	211:233, 9A  !
6A	done the business for Captain Benwick."	211:233,10A  !
6A	"Your feelings may be the strongest,"	211:233,19A  !
6A	"but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to	211:233,20A  !
6A	assert that ours are the most tender.  Man is more robust	211:233,21A  !
6A	than woman, but he is not longer-lived; which exactly	211:233,22A  !
6A	explains my view of the nature of their attachments.	211:233,23A  !
6A	Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.	211:233,24A  !
6A	You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough	211:233,25A  !
6A	to struggle with.  You are always labouring and toiling,	211:233,26A  !
6A	exposed to every risk and hardship.  Your home, country,	211:233,27A  !
6A	friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health, nor life,	211:233,28A  !
6A	to be called your own.  It would be too hard indeed"	211:233,29A  !
6A	"if woman's feelings were to be	211:233,30A  !
6A	added to all this."	211:233,31A  !
6B	"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in	211:234, 5B  !
6B	five minutes."	211:234, 6B  !
6A	"Perhaps I shall. ~ Yes, yes, if you please, no reference	211:234,21A  !
6A	to examples in books.  Men have had every advantage	211:234,22A  !
6A	of us in telling their own story.  Education has been	211:234,23A  !
6A	theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been	211:234,24A  !
6A	in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove any thing."	211:234,25A  !
6A	"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing	211:234,28A  !
6A	upon such a point.  It is a difference of opinion	211:234,29A  !
6A	which does not admit of proof.  We each begin probably	211:234,30A  !
6A	with a little bias towards our own sex, and upon that	211:234,31A  !
6A	bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has	211:234,32A  !
6A	occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances	211:234,33A  !
6A	(perhaps those very cases which strike us the	211:234,34A  !
6A	most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward	211:234,35A  !
6A	without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying	211:234,36A  !
6A	what should not be said."	211:234,37A  !

6A	utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment	211:235,23A  !

6A	I mean, while the woman you love lives, and lives for	211:235,29A  !
6A	you.  All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is	211:235,30A  !

6B	might have felt the same ~ her own family, nay, perhaps	211:242,33B  !
6B	herself, I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers	211:242,34B  !
6B	in honour if she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had	211:242,35B  !
6B	not thought seriously on this subject before.  I had not	211:242,36B  !
6B	considered that my excessive intimacy must have its	211:242,37B  !

6B	either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant	211:243, 2B  !

6B	I could exert myself, I could do something.  But to be	211:243,33B  !
6B	waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for evil, had	211:243,34B  !
6B	been dreadful.  Within the first five minutes I said,	211:243,35B  !

6B	unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and	211:243,37B  !

6B	It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the	211:244, 1B  !
6B	past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be	211:244, 2B  !
6B	mine.  I could never doubt that you would be loved and	211:244, 3B  !
6B	sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had	211:244, 4B  !
6B	refused one man at least, of better pretensions than	211:244, 5B  !
6B	myself:  and I could not help often saying, Was this	211:244, 6B  !
6B	for me?"	211:244, 7B  !
6B	"To see you,"	211:244,16B  !
6B	"in the midst of those who	211:244,16B  !

6B	you, conversing and smiling, and feel all the horrible	211:244,18B  !
6B	eligibilities and proprieties of the match|  To consider it	211:244,19B  !

6B	not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you, was	211:244,25B  !
6B	not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of	211:244,26B  !
6B	her influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of	211:244,27B  !
6B	what persuasion had once done ~ was it not all against	211:244,28B  !
6B	me?"	211:244,29B  !

6A	"You	211:244,30A  !
6A	should not have suspected me now; the case so different,	211:244,31A  !
6A	and my age so different.  If I was wrong in yielding to	211:244,32A  !
6A	persuasion once, remember that it was to persuasion	211:244,33A  !
6A	exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.  When I yielded,	211:244,34A  !
6A	I thought it was to duty; but no duty could be called	211:244,35A  !
6A	in aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all	211:244,36A  !
6A	risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated."	211:244,37A  !
6B	"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,"	211:244,38B  !
6B	he replied.	211:244,38B  !
6B	"but I could not.  I could not derive benefit from the	211:245, 1B  !
6B	late knowledge I had acquired of your character.  I could	211:245, 2B  !
6B	not bring it into play:  it was overwhelmed, buried, lost	211:245, 3B  !
6B	in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under	211:245, 4B  !
6B	year after year.  I could think of you only as one who had	211:245, 5B  !
6B	yielded, who had given me up, who had been influenced	211:245, 6B  !
6B	by any one rather than by me.  I saw you with the very	211:245, 7B  !
6B	person who had guided you in that year of misery.  I had	211:245, 8B  !
6B	no reason to believe her of less authority now. ~ The force	211:245, 9B  !
6B	of habit was to be added."	211:245,10B  !
6A	"I should have thought,"	211:245,11A  !
6A	"that my manner	211:245,11A  !
6A	to yourself might have spared you much or all of this."	211:245,12A  !
6B	"No, no|  your manner might be only the ease which	211:245,13B  !
6B	your engagement to another man would give.  I left you	211:245,14B  !
6B	in this belief; and yet ~ I was determined to see you	211:245,15B  !
6B	again.  My spirits rallied with the morning, and I felt	211:245,16B  !
6B	that I had still a motive for remaining here."	211:245,17B  !
6A	"I have been thinking over the past, and trying	211:246,18A  !
6A	impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with	211:246,19A  !
6A	regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right,	211:246,20A  !
6A	much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in	211:246,21A  !
6A	being guided by the friend whom you will love better	211:246,22A  !
6A	than you do now.  To me, she was in place of a parent.	211:246,23A  !
6A	Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying that she	211:246,24A  !
6A	did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those	211:246,25A  !
6A	cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event	211:246,26A  !
6A	decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any	211:246,27A  !
6A	circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.	211:246,28A  !
6A	But I mean, that I was right in submitting to her, and	211:246,29A  !
6A	that if I had done otherwise, I should have suffered more	211:246,30A  !
6A	in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving	211:246,31A  !
6A	it up, because I should have suffered in my conscience.	211:246,32A  !
6A	I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in	211:246,33A  !
6A	human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if	211:246,34A  !
6A	I mistake not, a strong sense of duty is no bad part	211:246,35A  !
6A	of a woman's portion."	211:246,36A  !
6B	"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven	211:247, 1B  !
6B	in time.  I trust to being in charity with her soon.  But	211:247, 2B  !
6B	I too have been thinking over the past, and a question	211:247, 3B  !
6B	has suggested itself, whether there may not have been	211:247, 4B  !
6B	one person more my enemy even than that lady?  My	211:247, 5B  !
6B	own self.  Tell me if, when I returned to England in the	211:247, 6B  !
6B	year eight, with a few thousand pounds, and was posted	211:247, 7B  !
6B	into the Laconia, if I had then written to you, would	211:247, 8B  !
6B	you have answered my letter?  would you, in short, have	211:247, 9B  !
6B	renewed the engagement then?"	211:247,10B  !
6A	"Would I|"	211:247,11A  !
6B	"Good God|"	211:247,13B  !
6B	"you would|  It is not that	211:247,13B  !
6B	I did not think of it, or desire it, as what could alone	211:247,14B  !
6B	crown all my other success.  But I was proud, too proud	211:247,15B  !
6B	to ask again.  I did not understand you.  I shut my	211:247,16B  !
6B	eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.	211:247,17B  !
6B	This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive	211:247,18B  !
6B	every one sooner than myself.  Six years of separation	211:247,19B  !
6B	and suffering might have been spared.  It is a sort of	211:247,20B  !
6B	pain, too, which is new to me.  I have been used to the	211:247,21B  !
6B	gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing	211:247,22B  !
6B	that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils	211:247,23B  !
6B	and just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses,"	211:247,24B  !
6B	"I must endeavour to subdue my	211:247,25B  !
6B	mind to my fortune.  I must learn to brook being happier	211:247,26B  !
6B	than I deserve."	211:247,27B  !
